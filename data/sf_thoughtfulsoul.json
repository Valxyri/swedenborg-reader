      "text": "FOREWORD by Huston Smith P ostmodern philosophers, though often critical of modern (seventeenth to nineteenth century) epistemologists, continue to accept Immanuel Kant's dictum that we know only where our concepts are validated by sense reports. I think of a tree. Is that thought true, or is it simply a figment of my imagina­ tion, like a unicorn? The answer depends on whether my physical senses-in this case, sight and touch-assure me that trees exist. This bears on this new book on Emanuel Swedenborg by indicating his importance. A number of Kant's followers were also admirers of Swedenborg, some to the point that they pressed Swedenborg's writings on him. Kant's reactions are instructive, for they show this most level-headed and com­ posed of philosophers in one of the rare moments when, in current idiom, he \"blew his cool.\" Swedenborg's firsthand re­ ports of higher worlds clearly upset Kant. \"What astonishing consequences would follow,\" he wrote, \"should the philoso­ pher make room in his philosophy for even one [of Sweden­ borg's visions]!\" Astonishing, indeed, for the consequence would be nothing short of the collapse of Kant's entire earth­ bound, sense-grounded epistemology, which continues to rule the philosophical roost. This book doesn't prove that Swedenborg's alternative view of knowledge-more generous in not tying it exclusively to sense experiences-must be accepted, but it does underscore two facts. First, ways of knowing are decisive in determining the worlds they open onto: a blind man's world is a world IX"

      "text": "FOREWORD without light. Second, Kant's restriction of knowledge to the domain of sense experience is arbitrary. If there are excep­ tional individuals who can perceive metaphysical objects as directly as normal people perceive physical objects, an episte­ mology more generous than Kant's is required to take ac­ count of them. The contemporary world isn't very open to the prospect of there being seers in the literal sense of that word: people who possess the \"Third Eye\" that Buddhists speak of and who ac­ tually see metaphysical entities. But savants do exist. That Thomas Fullers, a Virginia slave who could barely do more than count, could in a minute and a half calculate how many seconds a man who was seventy years, seventeen days, and twelve hours old had lived, not forgetting to enter leap years into his reckonings (2,210,500,800 is the answer) defies ex­ planation. In music, we have Mozart, regarding whose talent critics can finally say only that it came \"from beyond.\" And there have been wizards in other fields as well. Given the inex­ plicability of such talents, it seems arbitrary to rule out the possibility of metaphysical savants, among whom-along with Jacob Boehme, William Blake, and Rudolf Steiner-Emanuel Sweden borg must be numbered among the greatest. To credit Swedenborg as such a prodigy, we needn't believe every detail of his reports, for vision can be reliable without being 20:20. Still, the consistency in what he tells us and the way his visions seem to have empowered rather than inter­ fered with his life suggest that the outlines, at least, of his de­ scriptions are accurate. That conclusion gains force when we note the extent to which Swedenborg's reports-again, in their broad outlines-conform to those of history's other great visionaries. To readers who may be meeting SwedenbQrg for the first time in these pages and find his almost garrulous talk about angels initially offsetting, let me confess that I too went through that phase. Fortunately, however, I checked myan­ noyance by asking why clear-minded, well-balanced people like D.T.

      "text": "PREFACE At a meeting of persons involved in transpersonal psychol­ ogy some years ago, Jim Fadiman responded to the news that I was a \"Swedenborgian\" with a plea that the formidable mass of Swedenborg's writing be made more accessible. The conse­ quent effort to sort Swedenborg's thought into contemporary categories reinforced my conviction that the whole purpose of his theological output was to help humans move toward being more truly and profoundly human-to convince us that we are indeed souls, now and forever, and to inspire us to be thoughtful ones. Swedenborg did this with care, at length, and in the lan­ guage of his times. My selection of ideas from Swedenborg's theological works is based on the assumption that there are, so to speak, two distinguishable avenues of approach to his theology. There is the particular Christian theme, stressed (understandably) in the church institutions that arose after his death. However, there also is a strong metaphysical or univer­ salizing theme that gives a unique cast to his Christianity. Sweden borg insists, for example, that \"the good [people] of all religions are saved\" and is much kinder to \"gentiles\" than to traditional Christians. This aspect of his thought has been appreciated by such creative nonconformists as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, William Blake, and Samuel Taylor Coleridge. There is no question that, for Swedenborg, the Christian model was the most complete and appropriate. There is also no question that he saw Christianity as radically misunder­ stood in his own times, as having been bent to human institu­ tional needs.

For this edition, I have presented, overall and in each chap­ ter, the broadest context first and have moved into the realm of specifically Christian concepts only after that context is in place. I hasten to add that I have moved only a very little way into the wealth of detail of Swedenborgian theology. There is scarcely a statement of principle in the following pages that could not be annotated at considerable length. In my intro­ duction, I offer a biographical sketch to help the reader understand how Swedenborg came to his theology and to in­ troduce the man-the eighteenth-century Swedish scientist, politician, and mystic-who devoted the last thirty years of his life to timeless issues. Throughout this edition, I have translated Swedenborg's term charitas as \"compassion\" rather than \"charity.\" While I must apologize for the rather wooden consistency with which this is done, I find the former word used more and more to indicate the kind of heartfelt and active response to human need that the Latin charitas clearly intends and am also aware that \"charity\" is commonly used in a more limited sense, sometimes with implications of condescension. . I am grateful to a number of people who have helped me in my revisions. The Rev. Donald L. Rose responded to my re­ quests with some very valuable suggestions. Louise Woofenden made a number of most accurate and helpful comments on my translation of Swedenborg's original Latin, which have, I trust, been heeded. At the suggestion of Carol Lawson, I have added introductions to each chapter to place the extracts of Swedenborg's writings in a context and so to lighten the reader's task. These prefaces have benefited from a number of suggestions made by John L. Hitchcock. I also wish to thank the Sweden borg Foundation for its support throughout the writing process; its publications committee for constructive suggestions along the way; Harvey Bellin for urging the inclusion of the biographical sketch in my intro­ duction; and especially Mary Lou Bertucci, editorial surgeon and disarming correspondent.

We see the present with a particular kind of directness and certainty but often with a sense of ambiguity as to meaning. We see the past more remotely and selectively but with a much clearer sense of its patterns. We see the future more remotely still, with a view shaped by our sense of patterns and colored by our hopes and fears-very hazy as to detail. Part of understanding ourselves as individuals and part of understanding each other involve grasping how these three modes interact in the con­ sciousness of the \"self.\" To understand Emanuel Swedenborg's life as he lived it, we must try to move out of our retrospective view, to be aware of what was present, past, and future to him as his story pro­ gresses. In his later years, Swedenborg believed that every­ thing before 1744-1745 was preparation for his mission as a revelator, but this view cannot be retrojected into the \"prepa­ ration\" itself. Perhaps insidiously, those who find his thought relevant to the twentieth century may forget that Swedenborg was addressing his own eighteenth-century readers and may neglect their own responsibility to distinguish the timeless from the time bound. To provide a focus for this overview, I would highlight, first of all, Swedenborg's extraordinary intellect and, second, his intense devotion to two causes-the religion of his upbring­ ing and the science of his university education. At the begin­ ning of the eighteenth century, Lutheran orthodoxy and Cartesian science were parting company. This was a painful xvii"

It was a process that Swedenborg inter­ nalized. In his own home, religion was the dominant theme. His father, Jesper Swedberg, was a Lutheran clergyman with a good deal of evangelical fire (Queen Ulrica Eleonora enno­ bled the Swede berg family in 1719, changing the family name to \"Swedenborg\"). Eventually, Jesper would become a bishop, in and out of hot water with the church for his efforts to revise the hymnal along more pietistic and less orthodox lines. Theology was apparently standard conversational fare at the dinner table. It is also significant, however, that the family had substantial interests in the mining industry, mining being the mainstay of the Swedish economy. We may suspect that the family properties were a persistent minor theme. Jesper was on the faculty at Uppsala University when his son matriculated there at the age of eleven (not all that un­ usual an event); but, shortly thereafter, he was made bishop of Skara and moved to his new charge. At this time, Emanuel moved in with his older sister and her new husband, Erik Benzelius, who felt himself to be at the forefront of the Carte­ sian revolution and who, as university librarian, was very much aware of the latest scientific publishing. In one sense, it was a period of truce for science and reli­ gion. Charles XI had decreed just a decade earlier that science was not to make pronouncements on matters of doctrine and that the church was not to restrict scientific inquiry. It was perhaps only this rudimentary compartmentalization that en­ abled Swedenborg to pursue a scientific rather than a theolog­ ical course of study without causing a serious rift with his father. Swedenborg was graduated from Uppsala University in 1709, and the following year he set out on an extended trip abroad. At this time, England, France, and Germany were centers of scientific progress, but Sweden was relatively be­ hind the times. In London, Swedenborg studied the work of Sir Issac Newton, worked with the astronomer John Flam- XVlll"

When he returned home, it was with a portfolio of mechanical in­ ventions including a submarine, an airplane, and a stove, and with dreams of founding an observatory that would give Swe­ den a prominent place in the field of astronomy. In addition, on his trips abroad, he made a practice of lodging with arti­ sans and picking up their skills, which came to include lens grinding, bookbinding, and cartography. Indeed, throughout his long life, even though he eventually settled into a comfort­ able house in Stockholm and enjoyed his garden, he spent a good deal of time abroad. In regard to his later publications, it was far easier for him to publish in Amsterdam and London, where the presses were not subject to ecclesiastical censorship, than in Stockholm. He wrote in Latin in order to reach out beyond the confines of Sweden, so language was no problem. He also published his larger scientific works in Dresden and Leipzig, both because of the superior quality of the presses there and because this gave his works access to the larger learned world of the continent. Unfortunately, Swedenborg returned at a low point in Swe­ den's history. The charismatic Charles XII had made a spec­ tacular attempt to extend the Swedish empire by conquest and had met disaster at the hands of Peter the Great. The cost of Charles' campaigns had been ruinous, and Sweden's econ­ omy was in a shambles. There was no realistic chance of Swedenborg's realizing his dream of an observatory. Ulti­ mately, he found work as assistant to Sweden's foremost in­ ventor, Christopher Polhelm, and became what we would now call a civil engineer. With the support of the king, he then was appointed to a non-salaried position on the College of Mines-roughly the equivalent of the Department of the Interior. He toured the mining and smelting industries of Europe and published what turned out to be a definitive work on metallurgy. There were separate volumes on iron and copper, with an introductory volume laying philosophical foundations for physics and XIX"

This first volume, known most briefly as The Prin­ cipia, included both a carefully worked out nebular hypothesis and a theory of matter as composed of patterned energy. His life seemed pretty much on course at this point. He was profoundly disappointed to be still a bachelor after two courtships that had not worked out, but he was an accepted member of the government at the cabinet level with an inter­ national reputation in the field of metallurgy. The next major turn of events in Swedenborg's life came shortly after his father's death when he began to use his spare time \"in search of the soul.\" This was not an uncommon pur­ suit, but his approach was distinctive. Rather than theorize, he chose to undertake a very thorough study of human anatomy. If the body was indeed the kingdom of the soul, he reasoned, then that is surely where we should look. He spent time in dissection rooms in Paris but eventually decided to rely more on the published results of other researchers so that he might not be biased by his own first-hand discoveries. The result of this study was two substantial volumes that in­ cluded such substantial discoveries as the functions of the ductless glands and the localization of certain motor functions in the cortex of the brain. At the end, though, he had to rely more on doctrine than on the scalpel for his conclusions about the soul, and he regarded the whole massive work as having failed in its primary purpose. Characteristically, he de­ cided that he simply had not been thorough enough and set out to do it right the second time. He now projected eleven volumes, of which he actually published two, with substantial parts of others left in draft. He apparently began on this massive project in 1741, at the age of fifty-three. As he worked, he started to have experi­ ences of \"photism,\" mentally visible flashes of light or flame that, he came to realize, signalled his having arrived at some particularly significant insight. He began his \"prologue\" to the first volume of the new series by describing a kind of in­ born rational instinct for the truth, an assertion potentially at odds with the strict empiricism he had previously insisted on.

He began at about this time to record his dreams and to speculate on the guidance they offered. In his record of these dreams, we see a man struggling with his intellectual pride, with his alienation from his feelings, and with his distance from his childhood faith. On Easter weekend of 1744, this crisis issued in a mysti­ cal Christ vision of uncommon power. After a year of further struggle, a second vision, again at Easter time, left him with the conviction that he had been called to a new career. The event is worth sketching. The vision took place in a London inn where he was having dinner and began with the appearance of a shadowy figure in the corner who told him emphatically not to eat so much. Later that night, he was awakened by the same figure, who identified himself as the Lord Jesus Christ and informed him that he was being com­ missioned to disclose the inner, spiritual meaning of the Bible. After this, Swedenborg reported, heaven and hell were opened to him. From that time until the closing days of his life, Swedenborg had almost daily \"waking visions\" of the spiritual world, including extended conversations with angels and spirits. Sweden borg took his commission seriously, reviewing his university Hebrew and Greek and drafting his own extensive index of Bible passages. He began writing a Bible commen­ tary, posthumously published in nine volumes as The Word Explained, but left it incomplete. From 1749 to 1756, he published a multi-volume work known as Arcana Coelestia, whose full title might be translated \"A Disclosure of the Heavenly Depths in Sacred Scripture or the Word of the Lord.\" This work proceeds verse by verse and often word by word through the books of Genesis and Exodus, interpreting the narrative as a kind of parable with levels of meaning deal­ ing with the spiritual history of humanity, the issues and course of the individual's spiritual pilgrimage, and deepest of all, the story of the interaction between the divine and the human sides ofJesus.

One was a very slender work, little more than a pam­ phlet, on the inhabitants of the planets. Another, The New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, was a survey of the main points of his theology organized in brief discussions of its commonest terms. A third-perhaps the most startling-was a small work called The Last Judgment, in which he described having witnessed this event in the spiritual world. A fourth, again more booklet than book, made his case for the existence of deeper meaning in scripture; and the fifth, Heaven and Hell, presented the nature of the spiritual world as he had ex­ perienced it. It seems clear that he was trying to put his theol­ ogy in the most accessible form possible; and, in fact, Heaven and Hell has been the most popular of his works. On completion of these 1758 works, he returned to the task of Scripture commentary and drafted most of a commen­ tary on the last book of the Bible, Revelation. Knowing now that he would not be writing separate works on much of the rest of Scripture, he did a great deal of gathering of related passages and sketching their interpretation. The resulting work, The Apocalypse Explained, was never finished and was published only after his death. In 1763 and 1764, he published another cluster of separate works. Four of these were on specific theological topics: The Doctrine of the Lord, The Doctrine of Sacred Scripture, The Doctrine of Life, and The Doctrine of Faith. One was a kind of sequel to his little work The Last Judgment, and two were companion volumes entitled Divine Love and Wisdom and Divine Providence, respectively. Divine Love and Wisdom pre­ sented his metaphysics in its broadest and least sectarian form, while Divine Providence brought this \"down to earth,\" in a sense, in an effort to reconcile his experience of the beauty of the divine nature with his experience of a world full of vio­ lence and injustice. He then returned to the book of Revela­ tion and published a relatively concise commentary, The Apocalypse Revealed. His next project was a departure from previous policies in xxii"

It is intriguing to see him talking about the inner differences between the sexes on the basis of his en­ counters with them in the spiritual world and also to see a combination of a highly idealistic view of marital fidelity and devotion on the one hand and a remarkably nonjudgmental attitude toward deviations from this ideal on the other. The work on marriage was published in 1768, by which time Swedenborg was eighty years old. He was to publish just three more works. One was a booklet under the title The In­ tercourse between the Soul and the Body; one, a small and quite polemical critique of traditional Christian theology called A Brief Exposition of the Teaching of the New Church; and the third, the work that has been seen as his final summary, True Christian Religion. It has been my own contention, though, that this final work is less a summary than an effort to demonstrate that this theology is truly Christian. Two of his earliest followers, both clergymen, had been accused of heresy, and the ecclesiastical inquiry had shifted focus from what these men themselves had written to the works of Sweden borg himself. Perhaps there was a bit of his father's evangelical fire left in the old man, for he entered into the fray with a will. Swedenborg died in 1772 in London. His had been a life remarkable for its energy and productivity but even more re­ markable for its evolution. In retrospect, he seems never to have rested content with his achievements or his understand­ ing but always to have pressed deeper. Through years of expe­ rience that have caused later generations to question his san­ ity, he remained both gracious and grounded. He was socially accessible and \"low key\" and remained a very effective mem­ ber of the Swedish Parliament to the end of his life.

The present selection of passages is deliberately chosen and arranged to address the spiritual questions of this late twentieth century, when mechanistic and exclusively materialistic accounts of reality are being chal­ lenged. Principles of complementarity, indeterminacy, chaos theory, and holography mix with rediscovered age old tradi­ tions of meditation and healing to offer a sometimes bewil­ dering array of alternative views of our cosmos. I offer Sweden borg as a neglected resource in these times, of particu­ lar value because he stood on both sides of the great divide as a hardheaded scientist who had extensive spiritual experience. Digests and summaries of Swedenborgian theology are too numerous to mention. The clearest \"ancestor\" of the present work is probably The Gist of Swedenbm:!J (1920), compiled by Julian Smyth and William Wunsch This work was addressed to readers who were biblically literate and thoroughly familiar, though not necesssarily satisfied, with mainstream Christian­ ity. Three quarters of a century later, there is a large audience that does not fit this description. As to the arrangement of the present material, I felt it es­ sential to begin by recognizing Swedenborg's awareness of limitations on our abilities to \"know.\" If we take Sweden­ borg's words as the revelation they claim to be, it is all too easy to forget those limitations and drift into dogmatism. However, he is abundantly clear and insistent that there is no such thing as absolute objectivity, especially in spiritual mat­ ters. This does not mean there is no such thing as certainty­ just that there is no necessary connection between certainty and truth. We can be dead certain and dead wrong at the same time. Our affections, moods, and purposes color not only our interpretations of our perceptions but even the per­ ceptions themselves. In particular, the section on \"Doubt, Reason, and Faith\" in the first chapter is offered as Sweden­ borg's own \"indeterminacy principle.\" The second chapter, \"Holistic Reality,\" goes directly to the largest context of our perception and understanding, looking at the oneness and interconnectedness of the cosmos.

Chapter 3, \"Alternate Realities,\" explores the substan­ tiality and nature of spiritual reality. To my mind, these two concepts, that of \"distinguishable oneness\" and that of the re­ ality of spirit, pervade the whole Swedenborgian system and give a distinctive cast to even the most familiar of subjects. At this very general level, too, we may see the clearest affinity with concepts of contemporary physics on the one hand and with interests of contemporary spirituality on the other. The existence of alternate realities has implications for our own immortality, and this leads to consideration of ourselves as individuals how we are put together, so to speak, in chapter 4; how we may grow and change over the course of our lives, in chapter 5; and what constitutes a truly good life, in chapter 6. At this point, then, we have come from the cosmic overview down to the particular decisions of daily living, and the presentation turns around and heads back toward the uni­ versal. Chapter 7, \"Correspondence,\" begins by looking at a central principle of Swedenborgian thought, the principle that every material entity or process is the result and, therefore, a mirror of some spiritual entity or process. This is both the \"language of creation\" and the language of revelation. In other words, Sweden borg insists that material things and processes are modeled on spiritual ones, making the visible world a means of access to understanding the invisible one. The next step is, then, to look at revelation as it happens on the individual and on the epochal scale. This is the subject of chapter 8. Swedenborg would see it as no coincidence that communi­ ties tend to form around bodies of revelation, for the essential purpose of revelation, in his view, is the formation and nurtur­ ing of genuine community-spiritually seen, \"a heaven from the human race.\" Chapter 9, therefore, samples what he has to say about spiritual community, including some comments xxv"

Brilliant minds have been certain of the existence of God, and other equally brilliant minds have been just as certain that such belief is folly. If all our thoughts are determined by what has hap­ pened to us, where does error creep in? There must be a fuzziness somewhere. Somehow, it must be possible for us not to be affected by things that have happened, or to be af­ fected by things that have not happened. We must be able to perceive things not exactly as they actually are. \"Fuzzy logic\" is for real. In Emanuel Swedenborg's thought, this is an essential characteristic of the physical world. He prized human free­ dom and insisted that, if that freedom is to have any meaning at all, it must include the freedom to call evil good and good evil. The free mind must be free to err; or, in more personal terms, the only truth that is fully accepted is the truth that is freely chosen. As a scientist, Swedenborg had posited an ideal \"pure intel­ lect,\" an intellect elevated above the emotions so as to see re­ ality with total clarity. Once he began to experience the spiri­ tual world directly, he compared this kind of sight to sunlight in winter, when everything is indeed clear but when nothing grows. I am mindful, incidentally, that the winter he was talk­ ing about was not that of twentieth-century Boston but of eighteenth-century Sweden.

For all of us, the good is what brings pleasure to our affec­ tion, and the true is what therefore brings delight to our thinking.

When there is only a direct inflow from the Divine [which we could experience as arising from some unconscious level], the Lord is flowing in with what is good and true, but we are not conscious of it as good and true .... However, when there is at the same time an indirect inflow [i.e., through our envi­ ronment], then the good is perceived because the indirect flow is into the outward, sensory level of our consciousness. Arcana Coelestia 8701 [A]ll perception flows in through the inner [reaches of a person] into the outer or natural. The natural on its own per­ ceives absolutely nothing. Its perception comes from some­ thing prior to itself; nor does the prior something perceive on its own, but from something still prior-ultimately then from the Lord, who exists on his own. The inflow is of this nature and, therefore, so is perception. Arcana Coelestia 6040 The thinking of a healthy natural [mind: cogitatio boni nat­ uralis] is the thinking of the rational or inner person within the natural or outer person, based on the good of that inner person. It is the rational or inner person who thinks, not the natural or outer, for ... the inner person is in heaven's light, which has intelligence and wisdom within it, while the outer person is in the world's light, which has no intelligence in it, nor even any life.

In his work Quantum Reality (1985), scientist Nick Herbert concludes that there are eight distinctly different possible definitions; but even so, there is no general agreement that his list is exhaustive. It may help to in­ troduce some of Swedenborg's thoughts on the subject by a glance at the path he took in arriving at them. As a young man studying science in England, Swedenborg was fascinated by the theories of Sir Isaac Newton, which were just becoming known. He would later take strong exception to Newton's concept of a vacuum; and on reflection, the rea­ son seems clear: a vacuum places an absolute separation be­ tween any entities within it. Newton's laws indeed assume that the various particles, whether planets or pebbles, are ab­ solutely discrete. It is an assumption that works marvelously well in the field of mechanics and that lies at the heart of much of our industrial technology. However, since the work of Albert Einstein in particular, it has turned out that Newton's vacuum does not work very well at all on the cosmic scale or on the subatomic scale. In each of these realms, we need \"wave concepts\" as well as \"particle concepts\" to account for what we observe; and waves are re­ markably \"indiscrete\"-they interact and overlap in ways that particles do not.

It should come as no surprise that an individual with exten­ sive paranormal experience should stress the oneness of all that is. This is perhaps the most common and distinctive feature of mystical experience in all traditions. \"Oneness\" is a recurrent theme in Swedenborg's theological works, and his identifica­ tion of the essence of that oneness as being a union of divine love and wisdom lays the groundwork for a profoundly ethical view of the cosmos and our place in it. In the remarks prefaced to the first chapter, I singled out the concept of \"distinguishable oneness\" as pervasive and dis­ tinctive in Swedenborg's theological thought. It is nowhere more essential than in his view of the nature and relationship of love and wisdom, and much of what he has to say will be misunderstood unless it is remembered that, for him, there is no mental or intellectual \"form\" that does not have some af­ fective or emotional \"substance\" and no intent or feeling that does not have some cognitive form. In later chapters, this will be seen as basic to his views of human nature, the human process of growth, and human relationships. Equally remarkable, to my mind, are two further features of Swedenborg's thought in this regard. The first is that every en­ tity is constituted by the intersection of two forces-by its direct connection with the Divine and by its involvement with its sur­ roundings. This offers an inescapable \"both/and\" answer to the perennial nature/nurture debate and is wholly consistent with the rejection of absolute objectivity noted in the first chapter. The second surprising feature is Swedenborg's explicit atten­ tion to wave phenomena. He does not use the words for \"wave\" (Latin: unda, undare, undatio) very often; but he does state that \"influx\" (a flowing-in) is a wave phenomenon, and the concept of \"influx\" is basic to his view of reality. This, in turn, gives a spe­ cial twist to his view of the relationship between part and whole, which is surveyed in the final section of this chapter. 17"

Intercourse between the Soul and the Body 11 That [spiritual] sun, or divine love, cannot use its warmth and light to create anything directly from itself. In that case, the created entity would be love in its essence, which is the Lord. But it can create out of substances and materials so formed that they can receive that actual warmth and actual light. It is rather like the sun of our world, which cannot use its warmth and light directly to produce vegetation in the earth but uses substances of the soil that it can be in through its warmth and light, and thereby causes vegetation. Divine Love and Wisdom 5 Unless there were matching forces reacting against these ex­ ternal forces and thereby holding together and stabilizing in­ termediate forms, these forms would not last a moment. So we can see that there must of necessity be two forces if any­ thing is to arise and endure. The forces that flow in and act from within come from heaven, and through heaven from the Lord, and have life within them. Arcana Coelestia 3628:2-3 20"

The genii who are sensitive only to desires and affections draw out things proper to one's loves. For example, when I was thinking about someone I knew, then his image appeared in the middle as he looked when he was named in human presence; but all around, like something flowing in waves, was everything I had known and thought about him from boyhood. So that whole man, as he existed in my thought and affection, was instantly visible among the spirits. Again, when I thought about a particular city, then the spirits knew instantly from the surrounding sphere of waves everything I had seen and knew. The same holds true for matters of knowledge.

Perhaps we should regard him as driven to this conclusion by his own devotion to empiricism and remember that the subtitle of his most popular work, Heaven and Hell, is \"From Things Heard and Seen.\" He had come to trust his \"spiritual senses\" in the same disciplined way he had trusted his physical senses in his labors as a metallurgist and as a anatomist. In the material he drafted before publishing his Arcana Coelestia, there is evidence of indecision about what to do with accounts of his experiences. He knew, on the one hand, that to publish them would be to open floodgates of skepti­ cism, but he could scarcely suppress what was so basic to his own conviction-\"I have seen, I have heard, I have felt\" (Arcana Coelestia 68). In this presentation, I have chosen to deal first with Swedenborg's rebuttal of the principle of \"creation from nothing,\" Christian theology's usual way of avoiding panthe­ ism. To him, creation from nothing was virtually indistin­ guishable from Newton's \"vacuum,\" creating a discontinuity so radical that there could be no connection; and for him, any­ thing disconnected from the only source of being would in­ stantly perish. Creation must be both distinguishable from its creator and united to its creator- \"distinguishably one.\" Swedenborg describes, again on the basis of experience, distinct levels of reality, successively more distant from the 27"

In sharp distinction from many gnostic constructions of re­ ality, though, in which spheres are multiplied in what seems rather arbitrary fashion, Swedenborg's levels of spiritual reality are simple and coherent. The highest of human levels of spiri­ tuality he refers to as \"the heavenly\" (or \"celestial\" from the Latin coeleste): it is the state in which people are led sponta­ neously and unhesitatingly by their love of their God and of the neighbor. The second level he refers to as \"the spiritual,\" the state in which people are led by their delight in first under­ standing and then doing the divine will. The third level, \"the natural,\" is for people who are simply down-to-earth \"doers,\" more interested in what works than in why it works. This arrangement is a kind of macrocosm of our individual trine of will, thought, and act; and a microcosm, in turn, of the divine trinity oflove, wisdom, and providence. This is directly relevant to our own present lives, in that we are from the very beginning residents, albeit unconscious ones, of the spiritual world. The spiritual world is not a place to which we go only after death but the environment of our present inner lives. If it were not for our \"immersion\" in ma­ terial concerns, we would be far more conscious of this spiri­ tual environment than we are. Swedenborg sees us as living spiritually in a realm between heaven and hell, with our daily choices moving us closer to one or the other. Death, by mak­ ing us incapable of consciousness of this world, opens us to consciousness of the other; and after more or less sorting it out, we gravitate of our own accord to the kind of company we have come to prefer.

Hell is the ultimate zero-sum game. Distinct Levels of Reality People say that the world as a whole was created from noth­ ing, and they cherish a concept of nothing as really nothing at all. Yet from \"nothing at all,\" nothing is made and nothing can be made. This is an abiding truth. So the universe, which is an image of God and, therefore, full of God, could not have been created except in God and from God. God is, in fact, its actual reality, and it must be what it is from its reality .... But even though it has been cre­ ated in God and from God, it is not continuous from him.

They communicate only by an inflow that comes from the Lord alone through the heavens in proper sequence to the lowest heaven, not the other way around.

This is also why, after death, if we have lived lives of compassion and love, we can be brought into the third heaven. But for this situation to obtain, it is necessary that all the levels be well bounded and distinguished from each other by these boundaries. When they are bounded or distinguished from each other by these boundaries, then each level is a plane in which things come to rest, where the good that is flowing in from the Lord is ac­ cepted.

For we have a warmth of love and light of wisdom like that of angels. The situation in the heavens is like this.

First and foremost, death itself is a continuation of life but in another world, invisible to the eyes of our earthly bodies but visible there in a light that surpasses by a thousandfold the light of noonday on earth. Since I know this from so many years' first-hand experience right up to the present time, I can solemnly avow it. I now talk, and have talked in the past, with almost all the people I have known in the world who have died, with some just two or three days after their decease. Most of them were quite embarrassed that they had not be­ lieved that life would continue after death. I have talked with them not just for a day but over months and years, and I have been allowed to witness the successive states of their lives, moving either toward heaven or toward hell.

Arcana Coelestia 169 When we cross from the natural world into the spiritual, which happens when we die, we take with us everything that is ours, everything personal, except our earthly bodies. This has been demonstrated to me by an abundance of experience. For when we enter the spiritual world or the life after death, we are in a body as we were in the world. There is no obvious dif­ ference because we neither feel nor see any difference. But this body is spiritual, separated and purified from earthly things; and when the spiritual touches and sees the spiritual, it is just the same as when the natural touches and sees the natural. Heaven and Hell 461 In regard to our sensory abilities right after death, it is like this.

Arcana Coelestia 4622:4 Human wisdom, which is natural as long as we are living in this natural world, can never be raised into angelic wisdom but only into some likeness of it. The reason is that the raising of the natural mind takes place along a continuum, as from dark­ ness to light or from coarser to finer. However, a person whose spiritual level has been opened comes into that wisdom at death and also can come into it by having physical sensa­ tions go to sleep and then by an inflow from above into the spiritual elements of his or her mind. Divine Love and Wisdom 257:4 As long as we are living in this world, we have no knowl­ edge of the opening of these levels within ourselves. This is because we are involved in the natural level, which is the low­ est, and we are thinking, intending, speaking, and acting from this level. The spiritual level, which is more inward, does not communicate with the natural level along a continuum but through correspondences, and communication through corre­ spondences is not sensed. However, when we leave the natural level, which happens when we die, then we come into that level which has been opened within us in this world. If the spiritual level has been opened in us, then we arrive in the spiritual level; if the heav­ enly level has been opened in us, then we arrive in the heav­ enly level.

This is because they have thought and decided from that light that angels are only minds and that minds are like airy vapors, so that they do not have the senses that mortals have-no eyes, therefore, and if their are no eyes, there are no objects [of vision]. Yet angels have all the senses mortals have, far more exquisite, in fact .... I cannot briefly describe how things look to angels in the heavens. For the most part, they are like things on our earth but more perfect in form and more abundant in number. . . . But though the things one sees in heaven are largely similar to things on earth, they are not alike in essence. . . . The things in the heavens do not arise the way things on earth arise. In the heavens, everything comes from the Lord in correspondence with the more inward natures of the angels. . . . Since everything that corresponds to more inward things also portrays them, they are called portrayals; and since they vary depending on the state of the more inward natures of the people there, they are called appearances. Still, the things visi­ ble to angels' eyes in the heavens and perceived by their senses are as really visible and perceptible as things on earth are to us much clearer, in fact, crisper and more convincing. Appear­ ances from this source in the heavens are called real appear­ ances because they really happen. There are also appearances that are not real, things that are sometimes seen but do not correspond to more inward things. We will discuss these later. Heaven and Hell 170-173; 175 The World of Spirits The world of spirits is neither heaven nor hell; it is a place or state midway between the two.

I have been able to see that it is an intermediate place because the hells are below it and the heavens above. I have been able to see that it is an intermediate state because, as long as we are there, we are neither in heaven nor in hell. A state of heaven in us is the union of the good and the true in us, and a state of hell is the union of the evil and the false in us. Heaven and Hell 421--422 People can know, if only they use their reason, that the life we acquire in this world follows us: that is, we are involved in the same kind of life after death. They can, in fact, know that no one can shed the life acquired from infancy without dying utterly and that this life cannot be instantly changed into something else, much less its opposite. For example, if some­ one has acquired a life of deceit and finds the delight of life in it, then that individual cannot shed a life of deceit but remains involved in it after death as well. ... Removing such things is impossible without extinguishing every trace of life. Arcana Coelestia 3957:3 We can see from the foregoing that a spiritual state is quite different from a natural one, since it is characteristic of a spiri­ tual state that one cannot be anywhere but where one's ruling love is. This is, in fact, where the delight of life is, and every­ one wants to be in his or her delight of life. The human spirit cannot be anywhere else because this constitutes its life, its very breathing and heartbeat. It is different in the natural world. Here, the outward form of a person is trained from infancy to simulate in facial expres­ sion, speech, and act delights other than those of the inner person. So we cannot draw conclusions from the human state in the natural world about our state after death. For our state after death is spiritual, which means that it is not possible to be anywhere but in the delight of the love we have acquired through our life in the natural world. This makes it quite clear that no one can be admitted into heaven's delight (commonly called heavenly bliss) who is in 41"

Divine Providence 338:5,6 We undergo three states after death, before entering either heaven or hell. The first state is a state of more outward things; the second is a state of more inward things; and the third is a state of preparation. We undergo these states in the world of spirits ....

The reason we see them is that there is a way for every love, and love opens it and leads us to our kindred spirits. No one sees any way but that of his or her own love. Divine Providence 60 The reason angels are not superior to mortals but are simply their equals . . . is that all angels have once been people on earth, and none of them [was] directly created as angels ...

Our physical appearance may have little to do with our actual character, and it is our actual character that matters supremely and forever. The \"distinguishable oneness\" of love and wisdom is re­ flected in our own natures. For Swedenborg, the essence of being human consists of freedom, which is a matter of love, and rationality, which is a matter of wisdom. Our love is to our wisdom as substance is to form-distinguishable but insepara­ ble-and it is the substance more than the form that deter­ mines our fundamental quality or character. Further, there is a hierarchical structure to our loves, with the basic ones finding expression is specific aims. Swedenborg would have had no trouble at all recognizing the phenomenon we refer to as a \"hidden agenda.\" \"What we love above all things is inside our purposing like the hidden current of a river,\" he wrote in Arcana Coelestia 8855. In fact, the same levels that characterize the spiritual world are seen as characteristic of us as individuals. All, including self-love, are good when the higher rule the lower.

Divine Love and Wisdom 363 No one's life love can occur without derivatives, which are called affections. The affections of a hellish love, properly called cravings, are specific evils; and the affections of heavenly love, properly called delights, are specific good things. A love dwells in its affections like a lord in his dominion or a king in his kingdom. Their dominion or regency is over the elements of the mind, that is, the elements of a person's intentionality and discernment, and thereby over the body. A person's life 54"

However, the second level, called the spiritual, is not opened by this achievement but by a love of uses derived from dis­ cernment or by a spiritual love of uses, which love is a love to­ ward the neighbor. This level, likewise, can increase along a continuum to its peak, and it increases through insights into what is true and good, or through spiritual truths. Still, the third level, called the heavenly, is not opened by these but is opened by a heavenly love of uses, which love is a love for the Lord.

This [the design things true and good are in] is why heaven is called the Universal Human. Its very life is from the Lord, who from himself arranges everything in this design.

To show, then, how the correspondence of the outer person to the inner person works, I may explain briefly. Every regen­ erated person is a kind of tiny heaven, or a likeness or image of the whole heaven; so, in the Word, the inner person is called \"heaven.\" In heaven, the design is such that the Lord governs spiritual matters through heavenly ones and natural matters through spiritual ones, and thus governs the whole heaven as a single person; so heaven is called the universal human. This kind of order also exists in every individual who is in heaven. When someone is like this, then he or she is likewise a tiny heaven, or (which is the same thing) a kingdom of the Lord, because the kingdom of the Lord is within him or her.

It often seems that the most constant thing about our lives is change, and unpredictable change at that. Circumstances change, and we ourselves change. Swedenborg was deeply concerned to call us to be purposeful about the changes in ourselves and calls us to attend to the direction in which we are moving spiritually. Any picture of our human condition would be romantic in­ deed if it did not take into full account the obvious wrongs that plague as individuals and as societies. Swedenborg takes sharp issue with the doctrine of \"original sin\" if that is taken to mean that we are born guilty and, therefore, are damned. He insists, however, that we are born inclined to \"evil.\" In terms of the preceding chapter, we are born \"in inverted order,\" more sensitive to our lower loves than to our higher ones. We are more sensitive to our own pleasures and pains than to those of others and, therefore, tend spontaneously to protect our own interests at the expense of others. It is the central task of our earthly lives to do our part in reversing this hierarchy.

The first state is the one that precedes-both the state from infancy and the state just before rebirth. It is called void, emptiness, and darkness. And the first motion, which is the Lord's mercy, is the spirit of God hovering over the face of the water. The second state is one in which a distinction is made be­ tween the things that are the Lord's and the things that be­ long to the person. The things that are the Lord's are called \"the remnants\" in the Word and are primarily insights of faith that have been learned from infancy. These are stored away and do not surface until the person reaches this state, which rarely happens nowadays without trial, misfortune, or depres­ sion, which deaden the physical and worldly concerns that are typically human. In this way, the concerns of the outer person are separated from those of the inner. The remnants are in the inner person, stored away there by the Lord for this time and for this use. The third state is one of repentance, in which the individual, from the inner person, does talk reverently and devoutly and does bring forth good [actions] that resemble deeds of com­ passion.

The fourth state occurs when the individual is moved by love and enlightened by faith. Before this, the person did in­ deed talk reverently and bring forth good [actions ]-but out of a state of trial and constraint, not out of faith and compas­ sion. So now faith and compassion are kindled in the inner person and are called the two great lights. The fifth state is the one in which the individual talks from faith and, consequently, strengthens his or her devo­ tion to what is true and good. The things now brought forth are alive and are called the fish of the sea and the birds of the air. The sixth state occurs when the person says what is true and does what is good from faith and, therefore, from love. The things now brought forth are called the living soul and the an­ imals. And since the individual is then beginning to act from both faith and love, he or she becomes a spiritual person, who is called an image [of God]. The spiritual life of such a person is delighted and nourished by things related to insights of faith and to deeds of compassion, which are called \"food\"; and the natural life is delighted and nourished by things related to the body and the senses. This results in conflicts until love gains control, and the person becomes heavenly. Not all people who are being reborn reach this state.

The evil that wants control is in the natural or outer person, while the good is in the spiritual or inner person. As a result, even in our trials, the issue is the control of one over the other. If the evil wins, then the natural person controls the spiritual; if the good wins, then the spiritual person controls the natural. Arcana Coelestia 8961 People in the midst of trials are likely to drop their hands and give themselves over entirely to prayers, which they pour out passionately, not realizing that prayers [by themselves] do not work and that they have to fight against the false and evil things that the hells are injecting ....

We are actually focusing on it as our goal through­ out the struggles we are involved in, and unless it were our goal, we would not have the energy or the strength to fight. Arcana Coelestia 3696:2 There were some people who, in this world, had believed in instantaneous salvation by direct grace; and when they had be­ come spirits, they wanted their hellish delight, their delight in what is evil, to be transformed by divine omnipotence and di­ vine grace into heavenly delight and delight in what is good. Since they longed for this, it was allowed that some angels should do it, so they then removed their hellish delight. But since this was the delight of their life's love, actually their very life, they lay there as though they were dead, without sensa­ tion or motion; and it was impossible to breathe into them any life but their own. Divine Providence 338:7 In order that we may be capable of self-examination, we have been given the capacity to discern, and that capacity has been separated from our intentionality so that we can know and discern and admit what is good and what is evil. We can see, that is, what the quality of our intentions is, what we love, and what we crave .... When we see ourselves in this mirror, so to speak, and recognize what is sinful, then, if we ask the Lord's help, we can stop intending it, avoid it, and then work against it, if not freely then at least by force of [inner] strug­ gle, eventually coming to dislike and even detest it.

It is like this for people who are being regen­ erated. When a union of the good and the true occurs within them, which happens especially after temptation-trials, then they come into a state of delight that derives from heavenly peace. This [heavenly] peace is like the morn or dawn in spring­ the night is past, all earthly things are filled anew with life at the rising of the sun; the scent of plants is wafted here and there by downdrift of the dew. The gentle breath of spring­ time gives the soul fertility and fills our minds with charm; and this because the morn or dawn in springtime answers to the state of peace that angels have in heaven. Heaven and Hell 289 No one can know what the restful peace of the outer person is like, or the restlessness brought on by cravings and falsities, who has not experienced a state of peace. This state is so full of delight that it overflows every concept of delight. It is not just the ending of struggle but is a life that comes from a more inward peace, moving the outer person in ways beyond de­ scription.

For him, the life we are designed for is a very down-to-earth life of thoughtful and productive partici­ pation in human society. His own spirituality was grounded in such a life, as witnessed by his active participation in Sweden's political life well into his old age. About a year before his death, for example, he substantially enlarged a treatise on monetary policy that he had published almost fifty years earlier and published the new version in an effort to counter what he saw as short-sighted devices for dealing with unfavorable ex­ change rates. Heaven, for him, was a realm of active service rather than of passive contemplation; and an adequate founda­ tion for heaven was, therefore, to be found in active service here and now.

The answer is that we should do it genuinely, which means exploring our­ selves, recognizing and acknowledging our sins, asking the Lord's help, and beginning a new life. We have shown in the preceding section that there can be no repentance without ex­ ploration. But what is the point of exploring except to recog­ nize our sins?

As a result, things from either side may appear in different guise, so different that they may not be recognized unless one is in­ formed about correspondences\" (Heaven and Hell 356e; see p. 12 ff).

Exegetically, it is the relationship between the literal story of Scripture and a spiri­ tual message within, a subject that will be further developed in the next chapter. Experientially, it is what connects this physi­ cal life with our eternal spiritual life. It is all too easy to regard the relationship of correspon­ dence as a static one-this spiritual entity \"matches\" this phys­ ical one-but there are clear indications that the relationship is dynamic.

The light of the world comes from the sun; the light of heaven comes from the Lord. The world's light is for the natural or outer person, therefore, for the matters in that person. Even though it may not seem as though these matters belong to that light, they nevertheless do, for nothing can be grasped by the natural person except by means of the kinds of things that occur and appear in this subsolar world. This means they must have some trace of form from the world's light and shade. All the concepts of time, all the concepts of space, so significant to the natural person that thinking would be impossible without them, pertain to this light as well. In contrast, heaven's light is for the spiritual or inner person. Our more inward mind, the locus of concepts we call abstract, is in that light. People are unaware of this even though they refer to their discernment as sight and at­ tribute light to it. This is because, as long as they are involved in worldly and physical concerns, they can perceive only the kinds of things that are proper to the world's light.

All their divine worship consisted of correspondences, so we call the churches of that era repre­ sentative churches. They knew what correspondence was and what representation was, and they knew that everything on earth was responsive to spiritual things in heaven and in the church or (which is the same thing) portrayed them. So the natural things that were the outward [forms] of their worship served as means of thinking spiritually, which is thinking with angels. After knowledge of correspondences and representations had been forgotten, the Word was written, in which all the words and their meanings were correspondences, containing in this way a spiritual or inner meaning that angels are in­ volved in. So when people read the Word and understand it according to its literal or outer meaning, angels are under­ standing it according to its inner or spiritual meaning. All the thought of angels is, in fact, spiritual, while the thought of people on earth is natural. These thoughts do indeed seem different, but they are one because they correspond.

This is why, as we have just said, the more deeply we look into anything, the more wonderful, perfect, and intricate things we see. We have mentioned this to support the proposition that the Divine is in a kind of image in everything that has been cre­ ated but that it is less and less visible as one comes down by levels-far less when a level separated from the next higher has been closed and blocked off by earthly materials.

Yet, on the other hand, there would seem little point to a deity who did not communicate with us. There is material in each of the preceding chapters that con­ tributes to a Swedenborgian resolution of this dilemma. The first chapter gave reason for us to be wary of claiming any kind of perfect understanding. The second chapter proposed that the Divine, including all meaning, was everywhere present. The third chapter viewed the world in which we are engaged as a particularly dim and sluggish reflection of the lucid world of spirit. The fourth and fifth chapters presented us as beings both with limitations and in process, beings to whom freedom and rationality are central; and the sixth chapter touched on the interaction between the values we choose to live by and the depth of our understanding. Finally, the seventh chapter dealt with the way in which the physical world images the spir­ itual world.

In the Lord's Word, there are actual truths; but in its literal meaning, there are truths that have been adapted to the grasp of people who are involved in outward worship. In its inner meaning, however, there are truths adapted to people who are \"inner people,\" who in both doctrine and life are angelic, that is. . Arcana Coelestia 2531:2 In the earliest times, there was no Word, but there was a direct revelation to the people of the church; and through it, there was a union. For when there is direct revelation, then there is a union of heaven with mortals. The union of heaven with mortals is a union of the Lord with them, since the Lord's Divine among angels constitutes heaven. When this direct revelation ceased (which happened when people turned aside from the good they had been involved in), then another revelation took its place, a revelation through symbols that enabled people to know what was true and good. This church was, therefore, called a symbolic church. There was also a Word in that church but one useful only to that church. When that church too had been laid waste (which happened when they began to idolize the symbols through . which the church was then united with heaven and, in many lands, to turn them to magical uses), then it was provided by the Lord that a Word should be written that would be divine in every detail, even in every least word, and that would be composed of pure correspondences.

For revelation or the Word is a general ves­ sel recipient of spiritual and heavenly things and, thereby, uniting heaven and earth. Arcana Coelestia 1775 I have been told by angels that the Lord's Word is a dead letter but that, while it is being read, it is brought to life by the Lord in accord with each individual's ability. It comes to life according to [one's] life of compassion and state of innocence, with immeasurable variety. Arcana Coelestia 1776 I have talked with good spirits about the fact that many things in the Word-more than anyone could believe-are written acording to appearances and according to sensory de­ ceptions, such as statements that Jehovah is in blazing wrath and rage against the ungodly, that he rejoices over their ruin, that he even kills them. Things like this are said so that peo­ ple's pet opinions [persuasiones] will not be shattered but will be deflected. For talking contrary to someone's grasp of things (a grasp made up of appearances, deceptive notions, and pet opinions) would be sowing seed in water and saying things that would immediately be rejected. Still, these [ap­ pearances in the Word] can serve as general vessels containing spiritual and heavenly things, since these, being all from the Lord, can be instilled into them.

They seem to be involved in an affection for the truth, but they are not. The only people who are involved in an affection for the truth are those who love to be taught about what is true, that is, to know what is true, and who search the scriptures with this end in view. No one is involved in this affection except those who are involved in what is good-that is, in compassion toward the neighbor-and even more so those who are in a love for the Lord. For them, the good itself is flowing into the true and producing the affec­ tion, since the Lord is present in that good. Arcana Coelestia 4368:2 The Word is said to be closed when it is understood only in its literal meaning and everything there is taken as doctrine. It is still more closed when those elements that favor the desires of love of self and the world are taken as doctrine, since these elements especially roll a great stone over the mouth of the well.

In fact, their quality, and the quality of the character they form, is determined primarily by the effect they have on human relationships. The human cosmos sketched in the material selected for the preceding chapters is an intensively interactive cosmos. There is no such thing as an \"isolated\" individual. We are designed and created to live in community, and the whole effort of the Divine, through revelation and through the subtler workings of providence, is to keep open to us paths that lead to the growth of perceptive and loving communities. In this view, the resolution of inner conflicts (the struggles mentioned in the chapter on the human process) and the resolution of outer conflicts are different sides of the same coin.

He parts company with such mystics, though, in his belief that the Divine accommodates itself to our comprehension; and he spends far more time talking about what we can know than about what we cannot. The most accurate thing we can say about the Divine, given the limitations of our understanding, is that it is infinite \"love­ and-wisdom.\" The love is the energy that constitutes the sub­ stance of all creation, and the wisdom is the order or design that is everywhere present and in some measure perceptible to the truly inquiring mind. In one sense, then, Swedenborg's God is the very pattern of the universe; but this must not be construed impersonally. The very pattern, for him, is essen­ tially personal, i.e., loving, wise, and creative. In our own immediate experience, then, the most adequate 121"

There can be absolutely no thought here of a son sacrificing himself to allay the wrath of an angry father. This is the Father speaking through the Son, and as the Gospels insist on a number of occasions, the love and insight that Jesus mani­ fested toward all are the love and insight of the Father.

Here, if you will, we are at the very center of the theology, the point at which it all comes to focus. General Considerations All the elements of human reason converge and, so to speak, focus in this-that there is one God who is the creator of the universe. So the person who possesses reason neither does nor can think otherwise. Tell someone of sound reason that there are two creators of the universe and you will feel a resistance from that individual within yourself, simply from the sound of his or her voice in your ears .... Can anyone whose reason is healthy fail to perceive that the Divine is not divided, that there is no plurality of infinite, un­ created, omnipotent beings or gods? Divine Love and Wisdom 23; 27 If you gather everything known and submit it to the insight of your mind and, in some elevation of spirit, explore what everything has in common, you can only conclude that this is love and wisdom. These are, in fact, the two essentials of human life. Everything we have that is civic, everything moral, and everything spiritual depends on these two and is nothing without them. This holds true also of all the elements of the life of the aggregate person, which is ... the larger or smaller 122"

But [to the extent that] the Lord was involved in the frail humanity he had inherited from his mother, ... Jehovah or the intrinsic Divine that was within him seemed to be absent, while to the extent that the Lord was involved in his glorified human or his human made divine, Jehovah or the in­ trinsic Divine was present and was in his actual human. Arcana Coelestia 7058:3 We have stated and explained earlier that the Lord had two states while he was in the world, a state of humiliation and a state of glorification. His state of humiliation came when he was involved in the humanity he had gotten from his mother and his state of glorification, when he was involved in the Divine that he received from Jehovah his father. The former state . . . he left behind completely; and he put on a divine human when he left this world and returned to the essential Divine he had been in from eternity .... Arcana Coelestia 2288 The reason the Lord had these two states, one of emptiness and one of glorification, was that this was the only way he could progress toward becoming one, since this is in accord with the divine design, which is unchangeable. The divine de­ sign is that we should arrange ourselves to accept God and prepare ourselves as vessels and dwellings into which God may enter and where he may live as in his temple. 137"

      "text": "A THOUGHTFUL SOUL We are to do this in apparent independence, still acknowl­ edging that it all comes from God. We are to acknowledge this because we do not feel God's presence and working, even though God is most intimately accomplishing everything that is good in love and everything that is true in faith. Everyone moves and must move according to this design in order to be­ come spiritual instead of natural. The Lord moved in the same way in order to make his nat­ ural human divine. This is why he prayed to the Father, why he did his will, why he credited everything he did and said to the Father, and why he said on the cross, \"My God, my God, why have you deserted me?\" In this state, God does indeed seem to be absent. But after this state, there comes another, a state of union with God. In this latter state, we act as before, but we are then acting from God. There is no longer any need to credit God with everything good that we intend and do and everything true that we think and say, because this is written on our hearts and is, therefore, inherent in our every action and word. This is how the Lord united himself to his Father and the Father united him with himself. In a word, the Lord glorified his human (that is, made it divine) the way the Lord regener­ ates us (that is, makes us spiritual). True Christian Religion 105 [T]he Lord's whole life in the world, from earliest child­ hood, was a constant temptation-trial and a constant victory, the last being when he prayed for his enemies on the cross, praying, therefore, for all people in all corners of the globe . . . . Every temptation-trial is an assault on the love a person is involved in: the level of the love determines the level of the trial. If a love is not attacked, then there is no trial. . . . The Lord's life was a love for the whole human race and was so great and so perfect that it was nothing but pure love. This life of his was subject to constant trials, as we have said, from ear­ liest childhood to his last hour in the world .... [H]e was at- 138"

Since this love is not human but divine and since the amount of the love determines the amount of the temptation-trial, we can draw our conclusions about the severity of his struggles and the ferocity of the hells. I know the truth of this for certain. Arcana Coelestia 1690 It is an arcanum hitherto undisclosed that ultimately the Lord fought against angels themselves, in fact with the whole angelic heaven. But the situation is like this. Angels are in­ volved in the highest wisdom and intelligence, but all their wisdom and intelligence comes from the Lord's Divine. On their own, or from their own self-consciousness, they have no wisdom or intelligence. . . . They themselves openly admit this. . . . Angels also say that their whole selfhood is evil and false, both from heredity and from their actual lives in the world while they were mortals .... Since this is the case, in order for the Lord to bring the entirety of heaven back into the heavenly design, he had also to be subjected to trials in himself from the angels, who, to the extent that they are in­ volved in their self-image, are not involved in the good and the true. These temptation-trials are the deepest of all, since they act solely into purposes, with such subtlety that they can­ not be detected. Arcana Coelestia 4295:2 In order to make the human divine by following the usual course, the Lord was willing to be born like anyone else, to be taught and reborn like anyone else, but with a difference. The difference is that we are reborn by the Lord, while the Lord not only reconceived [literally, \"regenerated\"] himself but ac­ tually glorified himself, that is, made himself divine. As we are made new by the inflow of compassion and faith, the Lord was made new by the inflow of the divine love that was within him and was his own. This means we can see that our regeneration 139"

This has been made known to me from so much experience that there is not the slightest doubt left. . . . Our appropriation of the Lord's life comes from his love and mercy toward the whole human race, from the fact that he wants to give himself and what is his to each individual, and that he actually does so to the extent that we accept it-that is, to the extent that we are involved in lives of goodness and lives of truth, as images and likenesses of him.

      "text": "EPILOGUE In his doctoral thesis on Friedreich Schelling and Emanuel Swedenborg, Friedemann Horn quotes the German scholar K.c.F. Krause: \"If only all the divisions of christendom could agree on the simple, devout, ethical teaching that Swedenborg expressed so lucidly and cogently, that true Christianity is the observance of God's laws in the spirit oflove!\"* Swedenborg, I believe, would agree wholeheartedly and would urge us to see the intricacies and subtleties of his theological system as a defense of that simplicity against the intricate and subtle ratio­ nalizations that may arise from a sophisticated materialism. But that is not all. Swedenborg did not prize simplicity for its own sake. In good biblical fashion, his view of the goal, whether for an individual or for the human race, was not a re­ turn to Eden but the descent of the Holy City. He delighted in all new discoveries: for example, in the increasingly detailed understanding of the physical world that his microscope of­ fered. Theologically, as he found the fullest development of intellect to be inseparable from the fullest devotion to love, he also found the fullest expression of love to be inseparable from the fullest development of intellect. In his Essay on Man, Alexander Pope wrote the familiar lines Know then thyself, presume not God to scan; The proper study of mankind is man.

      "text": "A THOUGHTFUL SOUL For Swedenborg, the objects of the \"studies\" that Pope sees as mutually exclusive come together in the figure of the glorified Christ. We may not presume to scan the Divine, but the Divine has bridged the gap and, in a sense, made itself avail­ able to be scanned. it is not just that the Gospels command us to love; it is that the person of Jesus embodies divine love. If we \"study\" that embodiment-using \"study in that full sense it bears in the line, \"I ain't gonna study war no more\"-we learn how to live with each other and with ourselves. This is Christianity with a difference. Seen through the lens of this theology, the Jesus of the Gospels is very much in process. Love is not a \"state\" so much as it is an energy, an energy with an intrinsic direction. Further, to put it bluntly, in the case of Jesus, the process leads to absolute perfection, to a oneness with the Divine so complete that even the physical body is transformed. Any attempt to see Jesus as simply an im­ proved version of ourselves shatters against his resurrection. Lastly, at least for present purposes, the Jesus of Sweden­ borgian theology is intellectually brilliant. He has not only the most compassionate heart but also the most precise, retentive, and penetrating mind. In Arcana Coelestia 4329:2, Sweden­ borg distinguishes between \"obscure\" general ideas, charac­ teristic of minds that have little information, and clear general ideas, characteristic of minds that are learned. This wise sim­ plicity or \"innocence of wisdom\" is his ideal. There is the skill­ ful popularizer who can make us feel as though we under­ stand. There is a mid-range intelligence that can expound ideas that can be understood only by other mid-range intelli­ gences. Then, there is the profound brilliance that can shine through to total clarity. Jesus' field of study was the human soul, not in some kind of oversimplified laboratory isolation but in all its living rela­ tionships to its companions and to its source. The supply of raw data for such a study is overwhelming. No one before Jesus or since has comprehended that data so perfectly or spo­ ken so clearly and precisely to its essence. Try rewriting the Sermon on the Mount. 142"
