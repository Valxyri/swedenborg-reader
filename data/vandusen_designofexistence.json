      "text": "ixINTRODUCTION Approaching the Design of Existence The design of the whole of existence is an awesome idea. Even recently, it would have seemed impossible to describethe basic design. There are too many levels, too many con-ceptions. The whole fits together too wondrously. Now itseems that a quite adequate approach to the whole design canbe made. In future centuries, other explorers will improve onthis approach. First, I will lay out what is really meant by this bold en- terprise. Then, as part of our stage-setting preparation, I willexplain how this may be possible now and, finally, how wewill proceed. All this is to prepare and orient the reader. By the design of existence, I mean the total ordering of all levels of existence from God down to the material universe.You and I, as individuals, already participate in varying degrees at different levels. Our bodies are part of the materialuniverse, but our minds and inner experiences transcend the material world. But a key element is what occurs after thedeath of the body. Understanding the design beyond our present life is critical because it has everything to do with how we should live today. There is an overall drift in the design toward the Ultimate. It is critical for us to under-stand this drift, or the order within the order, because it ex-plains and gives meaning to every aspect of our existence."

But because Emanuel Swedenborg found the criticalmissing pieces of the puzzle, we can now comfortably speakof the entire design. Become accustomed to the idea that Iwill be speaking of a grand hierarchy of orders of existenceof which our lives are a part. When we reach what is knownof the ultimate level, we will only be able to point beyondand indicate that there is much more unknown to us. Yet thedrift of the whole design is so clear that we can each offer ahypothesis on the general nature of that more that is beyondour knowledge. The lowest element of the design of existence is the ma- terial universe. Certainly, we experience this aspect of the de-sign fairly easily, and the systematic probing of science hasfound much to explain its workings. We have no trouble inaccepting the material world as it is now known and beingdiscovered by science. As a scientist myself (a clinical psychol-ogist, to be precise), I enjoy learning about scientific findings.Still, I will not examine the wonders of the material worldsince the design I will be describing stretches well beyondthis realm, although, occasionally to illustrate points, the de-sign of the material world will be referred to. Although I have no quarrel with science, I feel that many people take the whole of existence as simply physical. This as-sumption is understandable since it is the material world weknow best. Present-day cosmology, which attempts to stretchthe material world to explain everything, is limited to thefour-dimensional, space-time material world. But, in trying toexplain our conscious experience and even more so in ex-plaining levels approaching God, the four-dimensional mate-rial world is simply too limited. x INTRODUCTION"

This is im-mensely clear. Although our brain is part of the four-dimensional, space-time physical world, our conscious inner experience isof a different order from the material. All material objectsexist in four space; however, our inner awareness occurs infive space and above. 1This accords with our experience. We can see and interact with material things, but, in our under-standing and awareness, we bring a different element to ex-istence. The aspects of creation that we will be dealing with in- clude our whole inner life and how this fits into the spiritualworlds beyond this one, indeed, fits into eternity. The innerlife can be seen as both psychological and spiritual. For exam-ple, suppose a woman gets into an argument with a child andloses her temper. On one level, it is a simple interpersonal dif-ficulty. But suppose this woman is a good Buddhist and be-comes concerned that she has temporarily lost sight of thedharma, the way of Buddha. For her, the same incident has then become spiritual, that is, seen in relation to ultimate con-cerns of her life. The meaning of the spiritual will becomeclearer as we proceed in presenting the design, but, basically, itmeans seeing our life in relation to ultimates. In order to pres-ent the design, I will look at human experience in its larger,and even its ultimate, context. This is not in the least to deny INTRODUCTION x i1. In my doctoral dissertation, entitled The Mind in Hyperspace (Ann Arbor, Mich.: University Microfilms, 1952), I took the mathematics of space and generated five-to-seven-dimension real spaces, demonstrating that mentalevents occur in five-to-seven spaces and explaining how these levels inter-act with the four-space material world."

In looking at the de- sign of existence, I am not looking at some massive intellec-tual structure outside ourselves. We are each a living exampleof creation itself. There is no one so limited as not to showaspects of this grand design. Since the design of creation pre-ceded us, we issue out of it. We are in it and reflect it. Sci-ence’s elaboration of genetics and the formation of the humanbeing is just a lower, material part of this. Because we are partof the design of creation, many simple points can be madeand clarified by reference to ordinary human experiences, as Idid by showing the different reaction of a woman who arguedwith a child and then felt she had temporarily failed to followthe way of the Buddha. The full implication that we are each in ourselves a part of the design of existence will only gradually become apparent.Because we are each a living example of the vast design, muchof what might be considered “otherworldly” can be intuitivelyrecognized by each of us. Heaven and hell may seem beyondus while we live in a body in this world, yet we will soon seethat each of us has already repeatedly experienced both heavenand hell. The more sensitively and reflectively we look at ourown experience, the more we will begin to recognize intu-itively the larger design of which we are an example. Why go into all this? It is a major clarification, an antidote to the stress of conflicting doctrines, opinions, and informationoverload. It clarifies our nature and the nature of all that is. The design of existence is what is. Our ultimate aim should be to live harmoniously within this design. This is the key to simple hap-piness.

In no sense is it limited to any one group, sex, age,race, culture, or religion. It is literally the universal. Certainly,in terms of religion, the design described here is universal andthus transcends all sectarian differences. As I mentioned earlier,there are still unknowns and vast mysteries in the design, butwe actually know as much as we need to know of the essentials.The design of existence is basically simple, and it is a wondrousdelight to see and begin to feel a part of it. Because we exist in and are a part of the design, we will be able to confirm the main lines of the design from our own ex-perience and understanding. This is not a matter to be takenon faith; it is far preferable that we attempt to confirm thisknowledge for ourselves, just as we can confirm the laws ofphysical reality with simple physical experiments. There isone proviso, however. We cannot fully understand and be-lieve what is beyond our direct experience.

Only because one needs to be a mystic truly to un-derstand and appreciate a great mystic, my own experiencebecomes relevant. I was born into an irreligious family and had no religious training. Yet I had the direct experience of the Divine in in-fancy (age one), childhood, and adolescence. By adolescence,I knew my experiences were unusual and concealed them. Ialso became self-aware enough that I asked myself how thesewonderful experiences came about. I learned the way. Whenalone and peaceful, I emptied myself so as to be instructed byall there is: as simple as that. The instruction I received couldvary all the way from tiny gentle lessons to overwhelming vi-sions in which, for a time, I lost track of this world and evenof being a human. Over the years, this natural experience has been aided and deepened by reading mystics of all traditions. Even as ayoung man, I was captivated by the wonder of the Hindu Up-anishads and Zen Buddhism because they spoke to me of myown experience. Christian mysticism was actually more diffi-cult for me at first, but among the first Christian mystics Icould appreciate was Emanuel Swedenborg. Later, for someyears, I read ancient Christian literature and feel as though Ilived a very full decade with Eastern Orthodox saints. There is an interesting story as to how I came to Sweden- borg before any other Christian mystic. My paternal grand-mother was a spiritualist minister, calling on the spirits of thedeparted to aid in counseling people. She lived on the good-will offerings of clients and was much honored when shedied. I visited her only a few times, so she cannot really besaid to have influenced me.

Now, my mother was completely skeptical about anything bearing on religion. She said my grandmother talked to spir-its because she could not hear real people very well. Mymother considered my grandmother foolish when she pro-nounced me her spiritual heir; and, when my grandmotherdied, her red volumes were thrown in the trash. That year Iwas gravely disappointed to get a book about Pinocchio forChristmas. I had already graduated from children’s books topsychic phenomena in my reading. Years later, I found works by Emanuel Swedenborg and became something of an expert on him. One day, in a Swedenborgian library, I saw a row of red books, and my hairstood on end. I knew these were the same as the volumespromised to me. They were B. F . Barrett’s, The Swedenborg Li- brary, a work no longer in print. I realized that, somehow, mygrandmother had managed to make me her spiritual heir eventhough my parents tried to cut the link. What is the real use in a mystic’s reading other mystics? T o a child, the mystical experience is like being shown allthere is at once; it is too much to grasp. But reading thethoughts of other mystics was like walking around the matter,recognizing similarities here and there.

Only recently did I de-scribe world mysticism. 2 The writings of other mystics spoke to me directly of my 2.

In contrast, reading scholars of mysticism, who never had the experience of God themselves, was quiteuseless, like watching pretenders trying to create the experi-ence of God. Their work led to so many misunderstandingsand false leads that I ended up throwing the books away—with the exception of the books of Evelyn Underhill and ofWilliam James. Neither ever claimed the mystical experience,but their accounts are so intuitively correct that, if there werea union of world mystics, Underhill and James would bevoted in as honorary members. 3 By far, the bulk of great mysticism is ancient. The avail- able writings of mystics passed down through the centuries isa gleaning of the best that has survived. In contemporarywriting, unfortunately, not much of real worth shows up.This is not because the true experience of God is rare; rather,few mystics write or get published. Publishing for a mystichas its own difficulties, especially since true mystics wouldlike to remain unknown and present only what is higher thanthemselves. Indeed, the Buddha directly asked his followersnot to speak of these things, so Buddhism, the religion thatproduces most of the world’s mystics, has relatively few directaccounts of the experience. What is the danger for the mysticwho “goes public”? It is egotism. So, they have to weigh thedanger of ego and vanity versus the possible benefit to others. Along the way, I have encountered a few pretenders, none of whom I will name. Each of these pretenders, in his or herown way, claims to be the messiah, but overweening vanitygives their game away.

One can hardly blame the leader who finds so many foolish people anxious to support a redeemer.At best, these pretentious people present a somewhat con-fused borrowing of the spiritual teaching of others. At worst,they come nowhere near the spirituality of even ordinarypeople. Anyone with a giant ego is no messiah. My survey of mystics of various traditions, in Beauty, Wonder, and the Mystical Mind, was undertaken with some trepidation. Would all these mystics from different culturesand traditions provide a universal message or would therebe insurmountable differences? I found a universal mes-sage. The major differences that seem to divide them arethe topics of reincarnation and karma; yet a close examina-tion of these doctrines shows no separation between East-ern and Western religions. (I deal with this matter in a laterchapter.) It is easy to see cultural differences. Christians have an in- carnate Son of God, whereas the Buddha claimed only to bean enlightened man; the very name Buddha means “the awak- ened one.” I found that both Protestantism and Judaismshowed few signs of mysticism. On the other hand, Hinduismand Buddhism are like advanced universities of mysticism.Still, despite these apparent cultural differences, a great un-derlying unity is shown by the world’s mystics. Often, I begin working by becoming plagued by a ques- tion and pursuing it until it is answered. Having beengrounded in the works of the mystic Emanuel Swedenborg, I was plagued by a question while surveying the world’s mystics. Do the other mystics report on the worlds beyondthis one as well as Swedenborg did? The final answer was no.

He also provided detailed connec-tions between heaven and hell and our personal experience.Our mind is inwardly in the form of heaven and hell. There isa clear dynamic connection between heaven and hell and thevery order and nature of our inner experience.

Of course, Swedenborg was a Christian and,like most mystics, reported what he found in the only reli-gious frame of reference he knew. Yet he was also reportingthe universal in Christian terms. These various trends combined into one insight: (1) All great mystics report the same universal design. (2) Yet to translate between the outer terms of the major reli- gions seems an almost impossible task. (3) But suppose I take one great mystic, such as Swedenborg.(4) I could then report the universal design through his writings.

Like all truemystics who write, Swedenborg never saw himself as a majorfigure. For most of his life, he published anonymously and re-ported himself as simply, “A servant of the Lord JesusChrist.” His works are the revelations he was given. Great-ness lies in the works, not in Swedenborg, the poor scribewho must have used up thousands of quill pens to set it alldown in the 1700s. In respect of this, his own wish, I willhenceforth use his name as little as possible and refer insteadto his works, because he regarded them, as do I, as the mostfaithful revelation a servant could put down.

Then, we can begin to get beyond the divi-sive questions, such as which religion is the right one. Allways to God are good. The right one for each individual isthe one that leads him or her to God and to loving conduct.So, in general, followers of Swedenborg might have as muchdifficulty as a reader who never heard of Swedenborg before.

Swedenborg was a natural scholar whokept notebooks on dreams and spiritual experiences. He be-came so famous that people collected every letter and inter-viewed everyone who could report anything. The outeraspects of his life will be briefly reported in this chapter. Aftera brief “outer” biography, a report on the externals of his life,we will look at the process by which he entered upon some ofthe richest and most extraordinary spiritual experiences everreported. Then, from the way Swedenborg entered the spiri-tual, we can generalize to the way others can enter the spiri-tual as well. SWEDENBORG ’SLIFE One of Swedenborg’s later great discoveries in the spiritualrealm concerned the inner design of all persons, an innate,natural, given love of each life as the central tendency in aperson. In subtle ways, this love bends and directs all activi-ties toward this one end. His discovery of the love of life willbe elaborated later. For the present, we will describe Sweden-borg’s own life in terms of two tendencies that will be our first approximation to his own love.

This interest extendedall the way from crafts, to the sciences, to cosmology, and tothe design of existence. As his life unfolds, bear in mind that Emanuel Swedenborg was a brilliant man who had to know all about everything. He was born Emanuel Swedberg in Sweden in 1688. His father, Jesper Swedberg, was at first a professor of Theologyat Uppsala University and later rector of the university and abishop in the Lutheran Church. Lutheranism was, at thattime, the Swedish state religion. Emanuel was the oldest maleof nine children. When he was eight years old, his motherdied. His father, needing a mother for his children, married asecond time, to Sara Bergia. In later reports of his other-worldly travels, Emanuel met both mothers in the spiritualrealm and found he loved both of them. We have little data on his early years. Of course, he must have attended church. We get the sense of a moderately strictand demanding father. In early years, Emanuel surprisedadults by his grasp of Lutheran theology, although this is notreally surprising given his gift and the fact that he lives in ahome focused on the church. Swedenborg reported that, as a child, he practiced minimal breathing as way into intense concentration. Noneof the Hindu texts on this way into the spiritual was availableto him at that time, so he stumbled on this practice himself. Alittle elaboration may help us to understand.

Car-bon dioxide builds up in his blood. He finds himself in a veryfocused inner state in which there are rich ideas and imagerythat all bear on his central focus. He continued this practiceinto adulthood, and it later became his way into the trancestate and spiritual realms. But, as a young man, all he knewwas that he had a way into great concentration and focusingthat aided his analysis. When Emanuel was fifteen years old, his father became the bishop of Skara. The family moved to an estate inBrunsbo, but Emanuel stayed behind at Uppsala University,living with Eric Benzelius, librarian of the university, wholater married Swedenborg’s older sister. Swedenborg’s univer-sity education emphasized religion and Latin, although hisreal scholarly interests went toward science. At the age oftwenty-two, he sent a whale skeleton to Uppsala, learned toplay the organ, and went off to London to further his educa-tion in subjects closer to his interests. For this young man oftwenty-two, London must have been like being released intoa wider and more stimulating world. He took rooms withcraftsmen, so he could easily learn a new trade. In this way,over the years, he more or less mastered the following crafts: • bookbinding • clock making• cabinet making • instrument making• engraving • inlaying marble• lens grinding • cartography Indeed, when he couldn’t afford to purchase the newly devel-oped microscope, he practiced lens grinding and made hisown. 6 THE DESIGN OF EXISTENCE"

In this book (and else-where), he described marriages in heaven. Before his death, ina private note, Swedenborg listed his property.

In the early 1700s in Sweden, one eitherwalked or rode a sled or horse. Formal transport was a carriage.Overseas voyages were made only on sailing ships. Althoughthe technology of printing had been known for some while,newspapers were just beginning to appear, the first one in Ger-many in 1714. Isaac Newton was still alive; J. S. Bach wasSwedenborg’s contemporary and his age. In fact, the early1700s was a period in which philosophical speculation wasstarting to be replaced by the beginnings of science.

Although Swedenborg enjoyed his position as a leading mining engineer, it was not enough to keep him challenged.So he explored and often published treatises on all the sci-ences of his day, making the latest available to others. He hasaptly been likened to Leonardo da Vinci, who, althoughknown as an artist, was also a considerable figure in otherfields. Swedenborg’s interests and contributions were some-what broader even than da Vinci’s. From about 1722 to 1744,a mere 22 years, Swedenborg published treatises on: • chemistry • hydrostatics• hydraulics • mechanics• optics • metallurgy• magnetism • acoustics• mathematics • pneumatics• geology • physiology• anatomy • cosmogony• cosmology • astronomy• dynamics • psychology Some of these fields are related to mining, but in areas ofmathematics, astronomy, and anatomy, Swedenborg was farfrom his chosen profession. The simplest explanation is thathe came close to mastering everything known in his time. Hetook the findings of others and often saw implications inthem better than others did. For instance, from the rude be-ginnings of astronomy, he may have been the first to formu-late the nebular hypothesis, which has since been confirmed.

Swedenborg was really asking about thenature of life and the essence of the human. In Paris, he stud-ied human anatomy. He thought that, perhaps by studyingthe details of the body, something might be inferred of thesoul. At this time, Swedenborg seems to have conceived ofthe soul in a physical sense, as though one might discoverwhere is it located in the body. He wrote volumes on theanatomy of the senses, the generative organs, and the brain,works quite advanced for their time. But, after much labor, hefelt frustrated. Although he had learned much anatomy, hehad not found the soul. In 1742, he wrote a volume on psychology, Psychologia ra- tionalis (Rational Psychology). Whereas astronomy and other physical sciences could be examined through direct observa-tion, the area of psychology was still considered a matter ofphilosophy. The style of the day was to conceive of humanfactors such as will, intellect, etc., and then to speculate onhow they function. But Swedenborg was basically an empiri-cal scientist. His psychology is an unusual mix of older philo-sophic factors and direct observation. His psychology, ineffect, was another attempt at finding the soul, the real natureof life and consciousness. In 1743, at the age of fifty-five, Swedenborg made a decision that was a critical turning point. His greatness hadalways been in direct empirical observation. Why not reallygo within and observe the soul at work? He would observehimself. Thus, what started out as a travel journal suddenlybecame a journal of his dreams. Once again, he would use di-rect observation to set down findings, only the realm hadshifted from outer things to inner events. SWEDENBORG’S WAY 1 1"

He assumed these were images of hisown life. I elaborated a good deal in my interpretations of hisdreams; but, basically, Swedenborg, on his own, did a remark-able job of interpretation.

By the end of his recordedjournal (1744), he had accepted and come to terms with hisfeeling side and with God.

Swedenborg, how-ever, went beyond this to seek the soul at work with a direct at-tempt at an encounter with God. In the course of this attemptto record his inner experience, his basic faults are illustrated.He tried to adapt to the discovery that he had been far too ra-tional and had neglected his own feeling/love side; and, asusual, he learned quickly. The entire period covered in theJournal of Dreams is only one year and ten months, with almost all of the entries in the period of March to October 1744. Eventhough dream interpretation could have become a major spiri-tual practice for him, he continued to explore other ways. In the course of his recording his dreams, this very sincere seeker of God encountered the Divine in several ways. In thegreatest of these, in April 1745, he learned from God that he isto be a major revelator of the Bible. So he set about learningHebrew in order to read the original Hebrew Bible or the OldT estament. He could already read the New T estament inGreek or Latin. The Journal of Dreams was, of course, not writ- ten for publication; it was first published in 1859.

Earlier, I mentioned that I could name other mystics who were stronger in describing spiritual practices. Althoughwonderful in many ways, Swedenborg’s works are weak onspiritual practice itself. My standard of greatness is the cen-turies of work on spiritual practices found in Hinduism andBuddhism. Swedenborg appears as a lone spiritual explorerwith no real tradition to guide him as far as spiritual practiceis concerned. Even among Swedenborgians, there has beenonly a gradual awakening to the process through which hefound his way. 10 I have long felt that, if Swedenborg had met with a group of spiritual seekers, they would have led him into clarifyingthe way. We are in an age of widespread communication. It ispossible now to bring together the best from different realms.So we take from his writings the best they have to offer, ac-knowledging they are less gifted in terms of spiritual practicesor ways to enter the spiritual. Let us briefly review how Swedenborg entered the spiri- tual, and then we can generalize from that. First, Swedenborgdevoted himself to his work. He had a servant or two for me-nial tasks. He was unmarried and had no children. Thus, hiswork was really his life. We must not credit his brilliance toomuch in his theological works. It was of great use in his ca-pacities as a lord in the Diet of Sweden, an assessor of mines,and an author of many scientific works.

Thus, we have the key ingredients of a great and persistent effort directed toward finding God. T o accomplish this,Swedenborg searched as diligently as possible and was led to-ward whatever served this end. His dream diary begins with aman who can barely remember his dreams, let alone interpretthem, but soon he had adapted the basic principle true ofdream interpretation used today. Since all the dreams issuefrom him, they must reflect his inner life. Later, he will alsosee his dreams as communications from the spiritual. Whenhe realizes his weakness in intuition and feeling, he writes The Worship and Love of God, a work in which he practices thesetraits. His work The Messiah About T o Come was another intu- itive experiment. It is as though he said to himself, “If theLord is present here and now in the Bible, why not assembleall the passages in which God seems to speak to me?” In theend of the Messiah, the Lord came and spoke through Swedenborg’s hand. Later, Swedenborg deepened this firstcrude attempt into finding the internal sense of the Bible, oneof his greatest contributions. A key question is how Swedenborg knew he was discover- ing God. T o understand this, we almost have to enter thedepths of spiritual practice itself. In his dream journal, he re-ceived many clues, so that it became apparent that he wasbeing led and guided by something wiser than himself.

It was also quite important to Swedenborg that this God he met was the same as the one he found in his Christiantradition, not some fanciful alien form. And even better yet,this God gave greater depth and meaning to Swedenborg’sown Lutheran Protestant religious tradition. The seekerusually feels modified within to understand better the depthof his or her tradition. Although early on Swedenborg hadtried automatic writing, when he ran into spirits inferior tohis own understanding, he dropped this approach. But, inhis main approach to God, he found a wisdom greater thanhis own. Now let us step outside Swedenborg’s situation to the spiritual quest anyone might enter upon.

If you have no religious tradition, explore whatever is at- tractive to you. A common way is to read and reflect on thesacred literature that touches and affects you.

Comparative religion and religious anthropology tran- scend religious differences. Social scientists examine the de-sign of various religions and look at the essentials of theirfunction in a nonjudgmental way. 1Huston Smith’s work on comparative religion is justly famous because it describes theoutlook of major religions in a way respectful of and accept-able to each. With this kind of outlook, we can appreciate dif-ferent religions as variations in ways to deal with the “morethan self.” Each religion makes sense to those who fully enterinto its ways. Religions are like worldviews that have survivedthe centuries because they meet people’s basic needs. Whenwe look sympathetically at what each advocates as goodbehavior, we find a wide area of agreement among religions 2 8 THE DESIGN OF EXISTENCE1.

Religionsfunction to guard marriage, birth, death—all the majorhuman transition points. They all function to improve theconduct of their adherents and to bring them into a harmo-nious community.

Wewill see more implications of this idea later. Of course, harmony does not mean complete agreement on every point. Differences in doctrine and ritual are permit-ted as long as the will of all tends toward what is good. Again,a quotation from Swedenborg explains this: “Dissent in mat-ters of doctrine concerning faith does not mean the Churchcannot be one church, provided all are of one mind in willingwhat is good and doing it” ( Arcana Coelestia §3451 [2]). From this view, all our differences simply enrich the whole we be-long to, the universal church that transcends sectarian differ-ences and accepts and enjoys disparities as long “as all are ofone mind in willing what is good and doing it.” We will seelater that the will to do good is the fundamental differencebetween heaven and hell.

He makes clear that the great essential is the quality of ourconduct with one another. Cultural differences, differentforms, practices, doctrines, etc., are incidental to this. More-over, his works often refer to the individual who is trying tolive well with others as a church in the least form; in otherwords, such a person is a church within him- or herself. A realchurch is made up of the coming together of a number ofsuch people/churches. The worth of the greater church, in aspiritual sense, rests on the quality of these people/churchesin the least form.

Swedenborg refers to the importance of a religion’shaving a human/God. Sometimes, as in Islam, the prophet ormessenger functions almost as a human/God or a humanlevel that manifests God. This idea should not be too surprising. All religions have some sort of incarnate God so as to create an accessible God.It is best that the incarnate God have the same nature as our-selves. Very early indigenous religions often had gods of thesun, mountains, streams, trees, etc. Animal gods were an ad-vancement toward a living creature like us. But a human Godis even more approachable because he/she is like us. Thus, weare made in the image of God. If the deity is human, we canreach this God through our interior nature. There aremythological gods like the Hindu Ganesha, the elephant-headed son of Siva. Stories are generated about them, andthey can be portrayed in dramas, so that their lives or adven-tures offer moral guidance. There is also a host of human quasi-gods such as saints, avatars, or great ones. Saints are revered in several religions;although officially banned in Islam, they have a place even inthis religion. These quasi-gods are people who lived suchexemplary lives that God “shows” through them.

It is said religious icons are windows to the spiritual. Ihave personally entered the spiritual with the help of an inex-pensive paper icon and can well appreciate this wonderful av-enue to the spiritual. 4 The Buddha is both an enlightened man and in some sense a representation of God. Many Christians create diffi-culty when they see Jesus Christ as the only possible incarna-tion of God, so that all other representations are false. Yetgreat Christian saints often saw everyone as Christ. EvenChrist stated, “T ruly I tell you, just as you did it to one of theleast of these who are members of my family, you did it tome” (Matthew 25:40). The key idea in God incarnate is thatGod is like us and is accessible through our own nature andinterior. A major spiritual practice is simply to attempt to belike one’s representation of a human/God, for example, forthe Christian to be Christ-like. This idea is repeated in all re-ligions that have a God incarnate. Far from seeming foolish,identifying with one’s incarnate God is a clear and appropri-ate way to enlightenment. It is not creating a false identitybut rather a way to find the God within. It is equally possiblefor a male to have a male God within (Christ) or a female one(the Virgin Mary). And the same is true for females. I believeCatholicism needed a major female figure like the Virgin THE UNIVERSAL DESIGN 3 94.

Early reli-gions saw the deity manifested in the sun, lightning, themountains, etc., a God quite unlike us who showed itself ingreat natural forces. Later, there were animal representationsof God, in which case God is a living creature but differentfrom us. The religions of a God incarnate finally imply thatGod is like us but still other than us. When people practicebeing like their God incarnate, whether a real or mythic per-son, they open the way to the discovery of God as a potentialin themselves. Carl Jung, the Swiss psychologist, remarkedthat there is hardly a better hiding place than within. Why?Because we tend to consider ourselves low in comparison toGod.

Those who believe in absolutist,judgmental religions are a long way from discovering them-selves. If they make black-and-white judgments, they havenot really explored their own inner nature. The discovery ofone’s self means coming to honor and appreciate all life. Indiscovering the full life within, you connect to all life. Life isone. So, we begin our search at this level as separate entities. But, following the great religious traditions, we explore in- wardly and find signs of a wisdom greater than our own.These signs increase until it becomes apparent that this littleentity of life is really just a part of all life. This is enlighten-ment—to see how it all is. k Now let us begin to work with these three aspects of God.When Swedenborg speaks of “the Lord,” he refers to all THE UNIVERSAL DESIGN 4 1"

Christians sometimes seem tohave difficulty with their own T rinity. The worst possibleerror is to see these levels as three separate Gods. Consider itthis way: our understanding is so poor that we need to breakthe Godhead down into this division because it reflects threeaspects of a oneness almost beyond our experience. The Fa-ther is those aspects of the one beyond our comprehension.The incarnate Divine is God in a form like us that we can un-derstand and relate to. The Holy Spirit is the Divine withinour life. Yet these three are really the One. The threefold di-vision is a concession to our limited ways of understanding. The fact that the Lord of Swedenborg’s works encom- passes all of these levels has a number of implications. Inthese three levels, we have all possible ways of conceiving ofthe One. The Lord is the God quite beyond our limited un-derstanding. Yet the Lord is also an incarnate person (real ormythological). And the Lord is also in us and the source ofour very life. Thus, Swedenborg’s writings are very muchopen to our actual discovery of the Lord, in whatever way we can. Although we have portrayed God in three aspects, we can also open this effort to the whole of existence portrayed inmany levels. For instance, the levels might represent thesupreme Godhead, to lesser great gods, to godlike creatures,to humankind, to animals, to plants, and, finally, to the mate-rial earth. Or we could portray the inner human nature fromGod, down through many levels to our consciousness, to thebody, to the earth.

The formsvary between cultures, and the number of levels is not fixed,as shown in the examples on page 44. Worshipers representas many levels as they can with their materials. Indeed, if you could really see your full nature, you would realize you are a stupa too. Swedenborg refers to inward andeven more inward levels in the human. The more inward arethe higher levels in our stupa/self. Existence is hierarchicallyorganized in as many levels as we can discriminate.

So we canlook at the living creativity of all life forms and conclude thatsomehow there must be a creative intelligence behind allthese manifestations. The details, complexities, and infiniteinterrelationships are a bit much to have arisen by chance. Spiritually, the higher shows its potentials in the forms created at a lower level. In places where the higher is repre-sented well by the lower form, Swedenborg states that thelower corresponds to the higher. Correspondence, in Swedenbor- gian terminology, is the link from the higher to the lowerlevel. We can give an easy example out of our own experi-ence. What a person feels inwardly would seem shut away,not available to us. But it is not, for inner feelings correspondto a person’s facial expression and affect even the subtleties ofmovement. The outer expression and movement correspondto inner feelings. The higher in us easily creates what corre-sponds to it.

Existence comes from the One,through all corresponding levels, down to the material world.Swedenborg writes that the whole of manifest existence is atheater of representations of the Lord. Notice that, on thisearthly level, there are only representations of the spiritual:the connections from the drama of the world to the nature ofGod are not that clear to us, so our visual world is a theater ofrepresentations. This same idea can be traced in all major religions. In Hinduism, creation is maya, illusion. This implies Brahma, the One, creates all, but tracing the line from things back toBrahma is not easy, as though the Ultimate is covered withveils of illusion. So we now have the way the higher creates the lower by correspondences. Humans are a wonderful example of this.What is really going on in any of us? Look at dreams, whichsymbolically correspond to our inner reality. Our entire lifedown to details of what we love and hate correspond to deepertrends in us. We are ourselves a complete theater of represen-tations, with endless scenes developing and disappearing. We need one last idea from Swedenborg’s works to un- derstand the complete design. It is the subtle idea of the end. Again, his works develop a causal relationship that is neces-sary to understand the spiritual.

The design or end is in the spiritual world. Thespiritual arranges causes and effects to realize these ends. Inour spiritual life, we are already in the world of spiritual ends.

Soends, generating causes and effects, exist in us and are part ofthe total order of our existence. Now we can put together Swedenborg’s findings con- cerning correspondences and ends. Correspondence accountsfor how things function from a higher to a lower, more lim-ited level, the lowest of which is the material world. Thehigher does its best to live, or even to exist, on lower levels, soit shapes lower levels as an image or representation of itself.The general nature of the higher favors life, as we see fromthe example of a flower, which is lovely and colorful and hasbuilt-in procreative possibilities. Correspondences representthis “pro-life” function between two adjacent levels. Theprocess of end-cause-effect is a broader formulation of thesame tendency as in correspondences. End-cause-effect canexist between two levels or among all levels of existence.Human ends are the broadest understanding of what a personreally is and will attempt to accomplish. We may see a di-sheveled, homeless man on the street. If his ends could beopened up, we might see the potential of a great person, butthis end cannot manifest itself under his limited circum-stances.

Although I am present- ing a concise explanation of what Swedenborg’s works state,be aware that it is also what great mystics of various other re-ligious traditions have found. THEDESIGN OF ITALL The One alone is. All other levels of existence are representa-tions of the One. The One is uncreated and is the Only. Allother levels of existence are manifestations of its potential. AsSwedenborg writes in Divine Providence §157, “The only one and very self is omnipresent, omniscient, and omnipotent.This only one and very self is the Lord-from-eternity or Je-hovah.” All other levels of existence are dependent on theOne. We can trace the various aspects of our own depend-ence. We are created from beyond ourselves into a form thatwe are still discovering, even after a long life. We are depend-ent on the earth to stand on, on air to breathe. Even the de-signs of our mind and inner life are discoverable to infinity.We are dependent on parents, relatives, friends, and societyas a whole. We are dependent on what others have discoveredand have shown us. Thus, we are totally dependent. The Onecreates the whole hierarchy of existence of which we aresimply a part. All other levels are correspondents and representations. The conception of this universal design transcends indi- vidual religions.

Aswe have said, the One represents itself through all levels ofexistence including our inner self and the material world; yet,within all creation, there is also a tendency to return to theOne. Our lives are very much a manifestation of both thisgoing into creation and this return. This is the design of allthere is. The enjoyment of the order of things is the experi-ence of the return to the One. When we describe heaven and hell in the next chapter, you will begin to see a clearer picture of levels of correspon-dence and representations of the One. Later, when we dealwith our internals as humans, you will see something of levels of representation and the return to the One. The re-turn to the One will be seen most clearly when we deal withenlightenment, which allows some individuals to approachthe One.

In Hinduism,the question of creation is answered as lila: creation is just play, for fun. Some may be shocked by this answer, especiallywhen they look at war and human privation; but this answercomes from the experience of mystics who found that cre-ation was done very casually, like a child playing and havingfun. I once gave the answer, “Just to pass the time.” Thisarose out of an image of the One alone needing somethinglengthy to fill up the vessel of time. In one vision, I wasshown the absolute necessity of creation because, withoutothers, there would be only the One. Once it created, it hadto step down from the One to the material world. So the de-termination to create in some respects had to have a stair-stepform such as we see. How could the One suddenly be mate-rial? There is a stair-step design as in a stupa, and we are partof the steps. Swedenborg’s works provide two reasons for creation. T o the question of why humankind exists, the answer is “thatthere might be a heaven of the human race” ( Divine Provi- dence §27 [2]). This statement needs some elaboration to be understood. Suppose God wanted intelligent agents to helpcarry out the design. In this case, our lives on earth are oureducation, with each person experiencing different things andbecoming wiser in his or her own way. Then, when we diedand went to heaven, we would each have something to con-tribute to the whole.

The Lord is love itself but is alone, so love creates others it can love. We see this inchildren who, when playing alone, create life in dolls thatthey can imaginatively interact with: It is the essential of love not to love self, but to love others, and to be conjoined with others by love. It is the essentialof love, moreover, to be loved by others, for thus conjunc-tion is effected. The essence of all love consists in conjunc-tion; this, in fact, is its life, which is called enjoyment,pleasantness, delight, sweetness, bliss, happiness, andfelicity. Love consists in this, that its own should be another’s; to feel the joy of another as joy in oneself, that is loving. . . . From this it is clear that divine love must necessarily have being and have form in others whom it may love, andby whom it may be loved. For as there is such a need in alllove, it must be to the fullest extent, that is, infinitely inlove itse1f. Divine Love and Wisdom §§47–48 The entire passage, §§47–51, explained over several pages, is worth looking at. So here is another possible answer as to why our creation was necessary: so that, in our relativefreedom, we might return the love that created us and sus-tains us to eternity. A similar formulation exists in Hinduismand in the philosophy of Plotinus. All of existence was createdthat you yourself might freely and consciously return to theOne, the return of the prodigal son or daughter.

T o do this, he mastered anatomy but foundthis was not a suitable way to find the soul. So, he turned toexamine his own inner life to see if he could find the soul atwork. This led to his study and interpretation of his owndreams. In the dream period, we see a man passionately seek-ing God and see that God becomes progressively clearer tohim. In April 1745, Swedenborg states, the Lord appeared asa man to him, giving Swedenborg his task for the rest of hislife and also opening the spiritual worlds to his exploration. Swedenborg’s Spiritual Diary is his private record of var- ied experiences in the spiritual worlds. He later pulled thismaterial together in his work Heaven and Hell. In addition, his spiritual experiences permeate all of his theological works, es-pecially the 12-volume Arcana Coelestia. In all these extraordi- nary experiences, Swedenborg is like a curious tourist.

Just as we introduced the universal outlook in religion to- gether with Swedenborg’s theory of correspondences andend-cause-and-effect so that the Godhead would be betterunderstood, we also need to understand a central aspect ofthe spiritual worlds. Understand this, and you can readilygrasp all that Swedenborg says on heaven and hell. There isan absolute emphasis on what a person truly is. Swedenborgoften described this as the external person versus the innerperson. The externals are what we see of each other in theworld, including social pretense, so a man may seem sincereand yet be a clever con man, skilled in extracting people’smoney. Externals also include what we think of ourselves.Within a person’s true inner nature, however, we see that per-son spiritually, inwardly, in what they really are. The inwardview goes beyond externals and may even present a pictureopposite to that presented by the external person. So,Swedenborg’s work presents a depth psychology deeper eventhan the depth psychology of today, which only begins to in-terpret the inner person. In the spiritual worlds, the innerperson is central, clear, and completely revealed. So, as we enter the spiritual, we see not only the external but, even more fully, the internals, the reality of the person’snature.

Is this realm like purgatory or any of the in-between spir- itual realms described in various religious traditions? Thebasic answer is no. What Swedenborg found is quite unlikeconventional ideas of purgatory. The first critical question is why we wake up in a spiritual realm. Swedenborg’s simple answer is that we awaken in aspiritual realm because we have always been a living spirit in abody. The body aids our learning in the material worldthrough our senses, our moving about and interacting withothers. The body is a useful but temporary vehicle in thegrand scheme of things. It dies when breathing and the heart-beat stops. Within minutes after these functions cease, an ir-reversible physical deterioration sets in. But the personawakens in the world of spirits and undergoes intense experi-ences. In that realm, we are a person as before, but our bodyis then spiritual and not material. This is confirmed in thenear-death experience. Most religions of the world teach this. Is there some way we can confirm it? Yes, in part. When we sleep and are “deadto the world,” the spirit becomes active in dreams. If we studyour dreams, we will find they are representations of our pres-ent life condition. This process, in which what is true for usbecomes manifest, occurs throughout all the spiritual worlds,according to what Swedenborg found.

Suddenly, you real-ize the living self that person was is gone and his or her body,a mere shell, is left behind. Thereafter, the loved one livesbetter in one’s memory. The near-death experience is a massive recent confirma- tion since there are now thousands of cases. A man dies in anaccident or on the operating table. Outwardly, he appears tohave no sense awareness. But inwardly, he has intense and im-pressive experiences. For a brief time, he is in his spiritualbody at the very entrance of the spiritual world. For somereason, he is sent back to this world and recovers conscious-ness. Much research has shown that often there is a positivelong-term effect of this experience on the person’s outlook. Another simple example can be found when we grow old and decrepit. Our body will gradually cease to perform atmaximum capacity, yet the inner self may still feel young andadventuresome. Which is more true: the outer creaking,pain-racked body which will soon fall away, or the inner ex-cited and questing spirit which continues on? In fact, as wewill see, the inner self comes to shape our outer appearance inthe spiritual worlds so that we will come to look young andlively, no matter what our age or physical state at the time ofdeath. Through all the spiritual realms, the inner person issubstantial and real. The fact that we always have been a liv-ing spirit becomes more apparent when the body falls away.In both Swedenborg’s works and in accounts of the near-death experience, it is reported that people awaken in the 6 0 THE DESIGN OF EXISTENCE"

He was also ushered throughthe process of dying so he might know what it is like. Weshould not take his account of dying as absolutely standardfor all. Modern accounts of the near-death experience suggesta basic pattern with some individual differences. Comparedto the sudden death of people in accidents, however, Sweden-borg’s experience appeared more leisurely and educational—after all, he was being instructed by angels. So, after death, we immediately awaken in the world of spirits. Because we have our body and all capabilities as be-fore, it is difficult to believe we have died. And we may wellmeet friends and loved ones who died before us. As mymother died, she saw my father and was a little surprised thatI could not also see him. Swedenborg describes this first stageafter death in Heaven and Hell §493–494: Our first state after death is like our state in this world, since we are then similarly involved in outward concerns.We have similar faces, voices, and character; we lead simi-lar moral and civil lives. This is why it still seems to us asthough we were in this world unless we notice things thatare out of the ordinary and remember that angels told uswe were spirits when we were awakened. . . . Since this is what we are like as spirits immediately after our life in the world, our friends and people we have known in the world then recognize us. Spirits per-ceive who we are not only from our faces and voices butalso from the aura of our life when they come near.

I have heard many people who had just comefrom the world overjoyed to see their friends again, andtheir friends overjoyed that they had arrived. It often happens that married partners meet and wel- come each other joyfully. They stay together as well, butfor a longer or shorter time depending on how happilythey had lived together in the world. 2 The central purpose of the world of spirits, which is lo- cated between heaven and hell, is to reveal our real nature, the “judgment” that will decide our eternal fate. Swedenborg indi-cates that the usual Christian idea of a judgment in which thesoul joins the body at some remote future time is a mistake(Heaven and Hell §456). The “judgment” Swedenborg re- ported is a subtle psychological process in which one’s true na-ture is opened. Out of that revelation, we decide for ourselveswhere we would be most comfortable, in heaven or hell. What does it mean to have our real nature opened? There are comparable experiences in life, and they usuallyoccur when we are relaxed, reflective, and receptive. Duringthese times, we can look back through our lives and see mis-takes, but we can also look forward and sense what we wouldmost love to do. This can be quite pleasant and elevated, evenjoyous, to get a strong sense of what we really are. In this, 6 2 THE DESIGN OF EXISTENCE2. Emanuel Swedenborg, Heaven and Hell, trans. by George F .

So we drift toward asociety in heaven or hell most suitable to us. Swedenborg found that there are a few people whose na- tures are so settled and sure that they enter heaven or hellwithin a few moments of entering the afterlife. But, sincemost of us are a mixture of good and evil, the usual process ofselection can take days, weeks, or months—even up to 30years. This is the second state, being let into one’s internaland real nature. The basic truth underlying this process is that we cannot progress further into the spiritual worlds while we are of twominds, willing one thing and doing another. Those whoseinner nature destines them for heaven are then instructed byangels about the nature of heaven until they are of one mind(Heaven and Hell §425). They then go to their place in heaven where they are warmly greeted by people like themselves. Ihave known artists who were in a joyous and elevated statewhen in the company of other artists; heaven must be likethat. As we advance into our real nature, even our external ap-pearance changes. And this refers to correspondences again:what is inside becomes reflected faithfully on the outside. There is much more in Heaven and Hell on these realms that can only be touched on here. For example, if we leavethis world seeking to learn, then we can go on learning in thespiritual worlds. On the other hand, if we are obstinate andclosed to accepting truth, we will be stuck in that attitude, aswe see from Heaven and Hell §508 [7]: This is how they behaved in the world when they were thinking in their spirit—that is, when they were thinking HEAVEN AND HELL 6 3"

After death, weretain the nature we had gained by our life in the world,which for evil people can no longer be changed for the bet-ter by the path of thought or of understanding what is true. So, it pays to die seeking. Thus, among the many details of Swedenborg’s Heaven and Hell, there are a few basic principles that make sense of events in the world of spirits: (1) We are a spirit in a body, and when the body can no longer serve the spirit, the spirit goes on. (2) We enter our sojourn in the world of spirits in a situation so like our previous life in the world that we may have to betold we have died. (3) We are at first in an external situation where we can meet and talk with other spirits. (4) The overall thrust of the spiritual worlds is that we each drift toward the inner life we have acquired. (5) It is not difficult to reach heaven, as Swedenborg amply ex- plains in Chapter 55 of Heaven and Hell. Indeed, he often wrote against prolonged pious meditation, rather advocat-ing a life of useful action: Some people believe it is hard to lead the heaven-boundlife . . . because they have heard that we need to renouncethe world and give up the desires attributed to the bodyand the flesh and “live spiritually.” . . .

In this way,we accept a spiritual life by means of our moral and civiclife; and there is no other way a spiritual life can be formedwithin us, no other way our spirits can be prepared forheaven. This is because living an inner life and not an outerlife at the same time is like living in a house that has nofoundation, that gradually either settles or develops gapingcracks or totters until it collapses. Heaven and Hell §528 Some church authorities later objected to Swedenborg’s account of heaven and hell. Where was God’s judgment? Spirits are allowed to go where they are most comfortable in-deed! But Swedenborg showed that a loving God does notpunish. It is punishment enough that some people are let intothe inner world they have created for eternity. Through this,Swedenborg sees punishment in more depth than we are ac-customed to.

Or they are called the third, second, andfirst; or the inmost, middle, and outmost. Throughout hisworks, Swedenborg uses the term inmost to mean the deeper, the more spiritual, or the higher. T o understand the design,we must understand the inmost. When the human mind isdescribed in depth, it also has an inmost. In effect, our mindis in the form of heaven itself. We are something of a heavenin the least form. Insofar as our inmost is opened, we begin toexperience the celestial. So, inwardly, we are a microcosm ora miniuniverse in the design of all there is. This will becomemore apparent when we deal with the design of persons. This is a simple and yet profound aspect of heaven: on whatever scale we look, there is the same design. We said ear-lier that existence is a theater of representations. We can lookat the whole or a level of heaven or a community of people inheaven or an individual person or the smallest leaf and see thesame design. With enough wisdom, the Divine may be seenin anything and in everything. In the world of spirits, we sort ourselves according to our real nature. Those for whom love is most central become ce-lestial angels. A further implication of their love is that theyact out their love and love God directly. Those who live bythe Golden Rule and love their fellow humans become spiri-tual angels. They express their respect for others throughdeeds.

How much can a per-son who spends a lifetime getting money understand thewonder and satisfaction of helping others? How much doesthe lifelong criminal understand of the spiritual? So what isseen in heaven is not altogether different from life on earthbut is a clarification of what is true here. Each heaven is made up of innumerable societies, com- munities of people who are inwardly alike and thus functiontogether in great harmony. We see something similar in thisworld; for example, baseball fans come alive when they can bewith someone who also loves the game. The harmony and co-ordination in heaven are extraordinary.

In the celestial heaven, the people/an-gels are most aware of the wonder of the Lord in their lives.At the two lower levels, this awareness is realized in a less im-mediate form as love of the neighbor and enjoyment in beinguseful. We see a kind of stepping down from the Lord to alife of love to a life of uses. But overall there is an immensesatisfaction of people living out their highest loves in a cosmicdesign beyond our understanding, as we see from Heaven and Hell §49: All the communities communicate with each other, but not through open interaction. Actually, not many individualsleave their own community to go to another, because leavingtheir community is like leaving themselves or their life andcrossing over into another that does not suit them. Rather,they all communicate by the outreach of the auras that em-anate from the life of every individual. An aura of life is anaura of affections based in love and faith. This reaches outfar and wide into surrounding communities, farther andwider as the affections are deeper and more perfect. Angelspossess intelligence and wisdom in proportion to this out-reach. The ones who are in the most inward heaven andtherefore at the center have an outreach into all of heaven,so that there is a communication of everyone in heaven witheach individual and of each individual with everyone. 6 8 THE DESIGN OF EXISTENCE"

We have already noted that those entering the world of spirits are in allrespects as they were in life, except they now have a spiritual,rather than a physical, body. Because their senses functionand they think and feel much the same as they did on earth, itcomes as something of a surprise to learn they died. The sig-nificant exception is that, as people become more of whatthey truly are, their appearance shifts toward a truer corre-spondence of their nature. In heaven, everyone sees what oth-ers are by their appearance. In addition, spirits have two memories—an outer mem- ory of all the events of their lives and an inner memory oftheir true desires and thoughts. As their outer appearanceshifts toward a better representation of their nature, they alsofind that their external memory recedes for the truer, internalmemory. All this is part of the process of becoming more ofwhat one really is. On earth, those who find and live out theirtrue nature are in a state close to what they will experience inheaven. Another significant shift in heaven concerns time and space. On earth, we are embedded in clock time; but, inheaven, angels exist in “psychological” time, which followsand represents their state. 3Also, the angels’ sense of time comes from the endless changes of their emotional state inheaven. Space, too, is no longer a rigid outer structure, as weexperience it on earth, but shifts to reflect one’s loves. The HEAVEN AND HELL 6 93.

This, inpart, accounts for heaven’s arrangement into societies of peo-ple of similar loves. They naturally go together and work to-gether in harmony. All this illustrates a central principle of heaven—the world of correspondences. What we are conditions our ap-pearance, going so far as to be reflected in our heavenlyclothes. The quality of life in a spiritual sense is representedeven in our dwellings. Heaven is a kingdom of representa-tions of a person’s true nature. This is true, although in a lessclear way, in this world. Study what kind of world a personexperiences, and you are looking at a representation of whatthey are. Inkblot tests and other projective tests work on thisprinciple—what we see reflects what we are. Angels also have occupations in heaven. People serve and are useful in the way most satisfying to them. Since the angelsare part of the Lord’s governing all aspects of creation, thereis a greater and more subtle variety of occupations in heaventhan we experience on earth. There are also marriages inheaven. The sexual element is seen in all its spiritual aspectsas the wonder of a union of differences. Married couples at adistance may appear to be one person because they are unitedin spirit. There are also governments in heaven, but they arean intrinsic reflection of divine order, of which our earthlygovernments are a poor representation.

Practically every aspect of heaven can be seen insome way in our present life, although not clearly. This is tobe expected; Swedenborg clearly indicates that those in-wardly preparing for heaven already have a place in a societythere, so it is as though all the higher aspects of our earthlylife here are preliminary experiences of heaven.

That is our freedom. In our earthly life, we are foreverdeciding between heaven and hell; but, when we die, our in-ward tendencies are opened in the world of spirits, and wefind which we prefer, heaven or hell.

In the way of hell, we care for ourselves because wethink we matter more than anyone else. Everything that leadsus beyond our individual being into being useful, into takingcare of people, and into caring for creation is the way ofheaven. The way of heaven expands beyond one’s self. Thelife of hell contracts to one’s self because personal aims mattermore than anything else. The life of hell spirals in and con-tracts into itself. One serious implication of this is that, from moment to moment, we are shaping the limits or expansiveness of ourexperience. The burglar visualizes his next break-in and whathe might get; this is a limited view.

The real issue is what havewe become now. There is always the chance to become betterin the present. THESTRUCTURE OF HELL Hell is the direct opposite of heaven. Parallel to the outer,middle, and inner levels of heaven, there are three levels inhell, which are set against the basic order of existence andhence of God, the source of all order itself. The three levelsof hell represent degrees of opposition ranging from slightlyopposed in the outermost hell to fiercely opposed in the in-nermost level. Just as there are societies of like-minded spiritsin heaven, so are there societies in hell of those with like ha-treds; and there are as many societies in hell as in heaven.The whole form of hell is a polar opposite to the form ofheaven. Just as the Lord rules heaven, the Lord also ruleshell. Being omnipresent, the Lord is in everyplace and neverabsent. Through angels, the Lord sets the boundaries andlimits to hell; otherwise, the spirits and demons there wouldbreak out and try to rule the universe to their ends.

There is a paradox about all this. Ultimately, only the Di- vine—which is love and good—exists. What then is hell? InHeaven and Hell §539, Swedenborg describes the illusion of power in hell: All the power in the spiritual world belongs to benevolent truth and none whatsoever to malevolent falsity. The reason all power belongs to what is good and true is that the essential divine nature in heaven is divine goodand divine truth. . . . Malevolent falsity has no power be-cause all power belongs to benevolent truth, and there isno benevolent truth in malevolent falsity. That is why allthe power is in heaven, and none in hell. Hell, it seems, has no power or substantiality. In my pro- fessional work as a clinical psychologist, I often encountered the demons of schizophrenics and had the impression thatthey were all empty pretensions, shadows of the real. Whenwe spiral in on ourselves alone, we enter a world of illusionsand false ideas that only seem substantial. Do we experience something like hell in this world?

The answer is as follows: Our lives on earth are brief, but we all make innumerable choices during our lifetimes. It is of central importance for each person to understand the kinds of choices which tendtoward heaven or hell. Heaven and hell are the design of whatlies between our lives here and God. We said earlier that theLord creates us (and all the rest of creation) so that we mightreturn finally to the source of all creation. Heaven representsstages of the successful return. Hell represents stages of beinglost, of aimless wandering. The possibility of being foreverlost is the ultimate result of our freedom. We can hardly conceive of any other knowledge that is of so much consequence. Anyone may understand the overalldesign and meaning of these revelations of heaven and hell.Yet to see how they are already present in our lives takes somereflection. Even if there were no real heaven and hell,Swedenborg’s work illuminates the subtle and interior aspectsof our lives on this earth. But this life is a real preparation forthe life to come.

Heaven is like itself inits greatest and least forms, in its entirety and in each of itsparts—like a hologram. The individual is one of the leastforms, yet each person reflects the whole design of creation.So the design of heaven and hell is very much at issue whenwe look at the design of persons.

You will recall that Swedenborg began his search for the soul about l740. This search took him on a journey throughanatomy, particularly the anatomy of the brain on which hebecame an early expert. Yet he failed to find the soul inanatomy. Then he explored his own dreams and inner statesand entered the spiritual. After years in the spiritual, he fi-nally came to a simple definition of the soul: our soul is es-sentially our life, particularly that aspect of our life in contactwith the Lord, the highest potential of our life. How simplethis is! The elusive, mysterious soul is life, just as we know iton a mundane basis, but somewhere in our life, we can con-nect with the Lord and the design of it all. The soul is thedeepest aspect of life that can connect each of us to it all. Canpeople lose this connection with the whole of creation? Yes,most certainly. If we do not know that there is anythinggreater than ourselves, we have no connection. People in hellare examples of those who lost this connection. So, their spir-itual lives are spent in relative torment because the greatestjoy is in this connection to the all. We can know and enjoythe design of it all, coming into potentialities far greater thanour little self. An essential element of the design of persons is an intrin- sic way to heaven. We are made for this end. All things thatlead out beyond the little self toward the all are marked byspecial joys, satisfaction, and pleasures. All things that lead tobeing locked within our limited self and its little concernslead into some sort of unpleasant experience. This is not justsome people’s experience; it is the intrinsic nature of every-one’s experience, our intrinsic guidance system to heaven. Weeach have an abundance of signs saying this is the way to go. 8 2 THE DESIGN OF EXISTENCE"

These higher joys are part of the Lord’s guid-ing us back home. If we individually examine our own highestjoys, we will be discovering our personal path back to theOne because the order of our own existence contains ourunique way back to the One. You are already on this way; infact, your interest in reading this book is part of the unfoldingof your way. Swedenborg asked the Lord if he should give some of his own experiences in the spiritual worlds as illustrations; theanswer was yes. So, his writings are punctuated by his spiri-tual experiences. For example, the following excerpt fromTrue Christian Religion §§71–72 is too long to quote its full ex- tent. Swedenborg hears a commotion from underfoot (hell).Out comes a demon pretending to be an angel. The demonshouts, “Where is the man who talks and writes about anorder to which almighty God has restricted himself in hisdealings with man?” The demon demanded this order.Swedenborg gives a beautiful summary: “I will give you,” I replied, “a summary, but not the details, because these would be beyond your grasp.” I told him: (i)God is Order itself. (ii) He created man from order accord-ing to order and to be subject to order. (iii) He created hisrational mind in accordance with the order of the wholespiritual world and his body in accordance with the orderof the whole natural world, which is why the ancientscalled man a micro-heaven and a microcosm.

The human mind is in the order of the whole spiritual universe, and the bodyreflects the natural order. Each person controls his or her lit-tle universe just as God does the whole. And how does a per-son come to experience the larger order? By means of aneffort to sense and cooperate with the order. Picture again theHindu/Buddhist monument of a stupa, which is a representa-tion of the entire hierarchical order of existence. The humbleseeker circles the base clockwise as though saying, “I sensethe total order and wish to live in accord with it.” A largestupa has many levels and stretches high above the seeker.But, by an effort to cooperate, the individual participates inthe design of the whole. 8 4 THE DESIGN OF EXISTENCE"

The three ascending degrees ofheaven rise from the lowest (similar to life here) to the high-est or innermost degree, which has the pervasive quality oflove. The individual on earth exists at the confluence ofheaven and hell, coming under the influence of both. This isour freedom. We can turn either way. It is as though the Lordwanted not just creatures he designed but wanted creaturesthat were free to choose. Only things decided in real freedomcount. It appears that the seriously mentally ill are not infreedom and so are not governing their fate, while those act-ing in spiritual freedom are deciding their fate. Because we are inwardly in the design of heaven, we have potentials ranging from controlling and understanding thenatural world up to experiencing celestial love itself. Eventhough it appears we have to die to experience heaven andhell, the opposite is true. We are already made up of both po-tentialities, so we have experienced something of heaven andhell while living on earth. We must become accustomed to mystery. Although we come from order and exist in a giant ordered universe, we caneasily be puzzled about the order. How much do we reallyunderstand of our own order? Not a lot. Even if we died andwent to heaven and were instructed by angels, how muchwould be left to discover? Everything. We are in a massiveorder, far greater than we can understand. Yet we are notalien to this order but are created out of it, so we can havesome vague intuitive sense whether a thing is more likely trueor not.

In the Eastern OrthodoxChurch, there is a lovely saying, “We are not given to under-stand it all.” So even though this book is about the ultimatedesign of it all, life surely remains full of mystery. The Lord iswise enough to sense our trying in the midst of this pervasivemystery. We stand at the conflux of heaven and hell; this is our freedom. Through the choices we make in this life, we aresetting our potential for heaven or hell in the life to come.The way to hell turns in on the self, regarding one’s self asmore important than anything else. The way to heaven leadsout from the self into interest in and cooperation with all else.The way out beyond the self is marked by special joys. Theway to hell, away from it all, into regard for the self as the all,leads to a constricted painful existence. The basic design is asobvious and sensible as that. INFLUX AND RECIPIENT VESSELS Since Swedenborg’s writings arose out of years of direct spir-itual experiences, we might expect that they could come upwith discoveries unlike the formulations of most religions.Swedenborg approached the spiritual worlds as a scientistseeking the truth.

For in- stance, he was shown how angels could affect his dreams byinflux out of the spiritual realm. Dreams, then, can be a cor-respondent, on our level, of the intent of angels on a higherlevel. Swedenborg gradually saw that the Lord governs theinnermost heaven, which conditions the lower realms that in-wardly influence us. Through this spiritual influx, the Lordrules all. Influx always flows from a higher to a lower realm.Lower realms in no way can flow into and shape heaven. Thelower cannot influence the higher. But the higher, throughinflux, is the real power behind the lower. Thus the Lordrules all, even the hells. But can we experimentally find influx in our own lives? Yes. We dream, don’t we? Are we clever enough to create thesubtle symbolism of a dream? If we were, we would know im-mediately what each dream means. Or do dreams just appear?Dreams and all spontaneous inner imagery are examples ofinflux. Negative and even murderous imagery comes fromhell. We are at the confluence of heaven and hell. But there is an even better way than dreaming to experi- ence influx. Those who set their mind adrift in meditationdiscover all sorts of imagery and inner events.

But there is a deeper sense of influx in Swedenborg’s works: we receive our life itself out of the spiritual. In Arcana Coelestia §3318 and Divine Love and Wisdom §§4–6, he states that we are actually recipient vessels. Each person and all ex-istence are supported out of the spiritual. Recall the image ofGod’s manifesting on successively lower levels in the image ofthe stupa. In this way, we receive life so we are really recipientvessels. We are not alone in this process; the whole of cre-ation, except God, is a recipient vessel. Each person is a re-cipient vessel amid a creation of recipient vessels. This seemsto be contrary to our sense that each of us is a person or selfwho rules his or her own body and life. Swedenborg makesclear that we rule as iffrom self. A number of things supports our identity. For one, we have a body we can more or less control even though most ofits inner functions are a mystery. We have a name, an identityreinforced by others and even by the law. We have a memoryof events up to this moment. All these things support oursense of being someone. With the sense of self on one handversus our being recipient vessels on the other hand, we havea major paradox. First, Swedenborg makes clear that we are to act as though we are responsible. The quotation above on order in-cluded this aspect, so I will repeat part of it: (iv) It is therefore a law of order that man from his micro- heaven or little spiritual world should control hismicrocosm or little natural world in all its parts, just asGod from his macro-heaven or spiritual world controls the 8 8 THE DESIGN OF EXISTENCE"

But the more we explore inwardly, particularly in meditation, the more it becomes ap-parent that we are really recipient vessels. Swedenborg pres-ents a basic truth: although the Lord rules all, we are giventhe sense of self by God, and out of this we are to act as though ultimately responsible. The idea of influx and the fact that we (and all else) are recipient vessels really constitute a deeper truth. If we exploreinwardly, we begin to see we receive our very life and all ourideas and thoughts out of the spiritual world. If we reflect onit, although we are each a life, we hardly know what life is,and even less how livingness is created in us. Influx can be di-rectly experienced, mainly through meditation.

Yet theunderlying greater reality is that we receive our life momentby moment. We are really recipient vessels, but such vesselsas are permitted to join in and perceive creation. If the little self uses its freedom to stand against creation, being for itself alone, it ends up in hell where its experience istormented by its own limitations. If the little self wants to dis-cover the real order of existence, then it can. A little explo-ration within shows all is given by influx.

What is the little self compared to this?The wide open vessel can know and enjoy it all. This is thesubject of enlightenment to be dealt with later. THERULING LOVE,THE ESSENCE OF OURUNIQUENESS There is another unique idea in Swedenborg’s works born outof the fact the writings stem from his 27 years’ experience inspiritual realms—that of the ruling love. Swedenborg foundthat the ruling love is the basis of societies in heaven. Peoplewho are alike—that is, who have the same ruling love—natu-rally come together.

I hope tojoin a society of those who enjoy learning of ultimate thingsand presenting these for the use of others. So what is this rul-ing love that brings together like-minded people? Each of us was created with a unique ruling love, an in- born central tendency. Obviously, we have no part in creatingthis. It is present all along in each person. Say we have a soci-ety of people of a similar tendency who want to create paint-ing. Each painter in the society will still have a unique lovethat his or her art expresses, so each is a unique expression ofthe love of creating beauty by painting. But because they areall painters in this society, they enjoy being together and sup-port each other’s art. It is as though the Lord’s love is infiniteand each person is ultimately a unique ray of that love. Theyare delighted by whatever brings them closer to what theylove, and tend to reject and hardly perceive what is contraryto it. The passages in Swedenborg’s writings which describethis ruling love are lovely in themselves, as we see in the fol-lowing excerpt from The Heavenly City §§54–55: Our love is our life. Whatever our love is like, that is what our life is like—in fact, that is what our whole self is like. But our primary or controlling love is what makes us the person we are. This love has many subordinate lovesthat come from it. These loves appear in different waysoutwardly, but all of them fit in with the primary love andmake one realm with it.

Wefeel very happy when we gain wealth, and very sad when welose it, because our heart is in it. If we love ourselves more than anything else, we keep ourselves in mind in every little detail. We think about our-selves, talk about ourselves, and do things for our own ben-efit, because our life is a selfish one. 1 Swedenborg always seeks the essential, the deeper aspect. In this example, the core of the person is seen in his or her ruling love, the love that defines all the unique personal ten-dencies. This ruling love controls all subordinate tendencies.I know a woman artist who has a kind of kinesthetic feelingfor the qualities of the lives of animals. So, it is no surpriseshe lives in the country with a number of pets. In college, shestudied animal behavior.

In what situations doyou lose track of time because you are enjoying yourself somuch? Of course, events in the spiritual very much define ourunique place in the scheme of things. According to Swedenborg’s writings, our ruling love is the very essence of our uniqueness, our own path to heavenand to enlightenment. The implication of a heaven that is animmense coordination of many unique ruling loves is thatheaven welcomes, needs, and tolerates an immense variety ofpeople. This heavenly variety is far different from churchesthat secretly hope to convert the world to their own way. Thereal order of things is a good deal wiser than that.

When we consider heaven and hell and our life in rela- tion to ultimates, we may confront a curious paradox. Theway to hell is marked by false ideas and limited assumptions.We can picture a person on the way to hell saying, “Whenyou are dead, you are dead. There is nothing else.” “Religionis the opiate of the people.” “Because I live only once, I’ll getall I can and have all the fun I can.” In contrast, the way toheaven is marked by mysteries. We are a mystery, surroundedby mystery. The way to heaven is marked by a humble seek-ing for what is better, even in the face of all these mysteries.So, hell is marked by foolish and limiting certainty, while theway to heaven is marked by a very sincere effort in spite ofprofound ignorance.

The external and the internal express the same basicdistinction as in the spiritual above. We are in externals whencaught up in things of the world, even in bodily concerns. Weare in internals when we consider our ends, what we love aboveall else, what we really want out of life. We are even in internalswhen we reflect on our real nature. Thus, externals involvespecific mundane things, like “Has the price of this milk goneup?” Internals are more general. They take in a greater sweepof our life. For instance, when reflecting on our life, we are, asit were, compiling the general tenor of many memories. Thisdeeper and broader aspect of our own internals is true throughall the spiritual worlds. In Chapters 27 and 28 of Heaven and Hell, Swedenborg describes the speech and thought of angels, which comprises so much more than our own.

When our own internals are open, it is asthough we visit a broad, wondrous, and ideal world of possibil-ities. It is indeed like heaven itself because our innermost inter-nals are in the form of heaven itself. If we were to see anotherperson’s internals, we would see them in what they really are.Great mystics sometimes see people in this depth. A man hadfought cancer and seemed to be well, but he couldn’t shake offthe feeling he might be ill in some deeper way. He went to seeSai Baba, who said in greeting him, “But you are well already!”thereby perceiving and answering the man’s real question whilefirst meeting him. 2In our internal, we can perceive aspects of heaven. As Swedenborg found, the innermost heaven is the ce-lestial, a sphere of love; and, in our internals, we can experienceour deepest loves and the loves of others. Even in our memories, there is the external and internal aspect, according to Swedenborg’s writings. The external ofmemory is filled with the details of our outer life, while theinternal memory contains the deeper, more touching, and sa-cred experiences that shape our life and reflect what we reallyare. In Arcana Coelestia §1739, Swedenborg even describes our inner memory of everything sacred, terming it our re- mains. When faced with death, people draw on their remains,their personal treasure of spiritual understanding. The innermemory and our remains are the depth aspect of our mem-ory. This is explained in Arcana Coelestia §561: But what are remains? Not only the goods and truths which one has learned from the Word of the Lord from OUR INNER DESIGN 9 72.

Let us examinewill and understanding, which characterize our life and mind.Once we understand this duality, we will be able to under-stand all the other dualities. In each of these dualities we are given an interior and critical one (in the case of the mind, will) and a less signifi-cant, outer one (here, understanding). The will, being themore interior, is the less obvious. The person can speak atlength of his or her understanding, so it is the more externaland obvious. But how that person expresses his or her will canlead to heaven or hell. The outer understanding is far lesscritical to our destiny. We can understand all about the spiri-tual and lecture extensively on it and still be destined for hell.What you will—what you do—is critical. This is the same assaying one’s end or real intent is everything in the spiritual.People can easily pretend and falsify their exteriors, such aswhen they try to impress others. So, the dualities expressed inhis writings are another way of describing ourselves in depth. Let us apply this to people. A man might make a living lecturing on human love and yet be rather cruel to his familyand may even set out to defeat competitors. Here the outerdoes not match the inner, in which case the man tends towardhell. But suppose we have a woman who is almost tongue-tiedand unable to speak on these things.

At best, the other, outer side of the duality is merely a sign of theinner. We come into the spiritual when the depth aspect ofthe duality is accurately reflected in the outer reality. In thiscase, one’s wisdom is of love. Our understanding stems fromour will, but our good is expressed in truth. That is, joinedtogether, understanding and goodness comprise a congruentlife in which each person expresses and shows his or herdeeper side. When the duality is joined into one, life exists.The frequent use of dualities in Swedenborg’s writings pointsto this depth understanding. Congruence in these is the wayto heaven. This can be illustrated. In the period of Swedenborg’s journal of dreams (1744), his main problem was that, whileoutwardly he was a very verbal and clever man, he was weakand ignorant on understanding love. This was portrayed indreams as his relationship to women (love). One translatorwas so scandalized at the apparently sexual content that, al-though translating Swedenborg’s journal into English fromits original Swedish, the translator translated the sexualdreams into Latin! During the period in which he recordedhis dreams, Swedenborg was on a major quest to find God. Inhis dreams, he worked out his relationship to women/love.He literally could not enter the spiritual unless he came toterms with love. When this problem was worked out, hecould and did literally enter the spiritual. Ever after, one cansee in his writings that love rules and is the key. God is love,and loving is a pleasant way to God. So love, being the natureof heaven and of our own interior, is critical.

A deeper answer is provided in The Heavenly City §276, where it states that God permits evil so that the goodmay be illustrated. Without darkness, we cannot really under-stand light. If we survey a variety of people, we will find thatoften they have experienced rather different evils. The evilswe personally experience make us permanently opposed tocertain kinds of evil.

Youbecome extraordinarily alert to anything that might be rele-vant. You run into a friend who had a similar situation, and heis helpful. I have had a medical newsletter discuss my rarecondition in the issue that arrived after I was diagnosed, al-though it had not even been mentioned in the newsletter forfive years. The help can come in the form of a sudden intu-ition. There is a real wisdom of the body. Asking for helpfrom within prepares you to receive help from any source.

T ests showed atotal remission. This came as a profound surprise to me. Itseemed a clear indication that I was to reflect on my body.For years I had simply overlooked my body. A recently published book, Donald Bakal’s Minding the Body, presents evidence for the theory that merely paying at- tention to the body is therapeutic; however, Bakal does notmake clear how this happens. After my experience in thisarea, I can make a suggestion as to how it works. The body isan intelligent kingdom in its own right. When it screams withpain, it wants attention. When you give it attention, itscreams less. It needs your awareness and cooperation. Withyour attention and awareness, you and your body begin towork out your differences. Body is aware of your ignorancebut responds well to any kind of attempt at cooperation. Andby honestly seeking help from any source, inner or outer, youprepare yourself to get ideas that can be tried. There is another possibility in this realm. Remember autosymbolism or Swedenborg’s theory of correspondences?In the inner realm, you may encounter symbolic representa-tions of the real meaning of a physical problem. These are thespiritual equivalents of a disorder. For instance, heart prob-lems often have to do with love, anger, or strong emotion.Difficulties in digestion reflect accepting and making use ofthe environment. Psychosomatic medicine is filled with suchrepresentations. If you are given an autosymbolic representa-tion of your illness, reflect on it, play with it until you can seeits truth. All this inner work is not to replace the ordinaryconception of ourselves as a complex machine that needs tobe kept in order, but it is a deeper aspect of living with a body. 1 1 4 THE DESIGN OF EXISTENCE"

What spirit? They must have createdit. If we were foolish enough to attack the reality of the riverspirit, members of the tribe would give us examples of timeswhen a lack of respect for the river spirit caused trouble.These instances would seem self-fulfilling to us. T o the out-sider, of course, the people created both the river spirit andtheir ceremony to show it respect.

The whole level of incarnate gods isan example of this. Let us say the indigenous people have de-vised some kind of picture of an incarnate God. Because thisvision is projected out of them, they can feel its reality. Theimage becomes a useful representation to them. T o an out-sider, however, the image may appear ridiculous because theoutsider has no sense of the inner reality projected. As a mys-tic, I find this process far from foolish.

Also note this area is one of relative realities. The skeptic cannot find a river spirit, so, for him, this is all nonsense. Butthe animist, raised in the framework of spirits everywhere,certainly can find and deal with the river spirit. It is a mistaketo get so distant from actual human experience as to think wecan know absolutely whether the river spirit exists. T o the na-tive, the spirit’s existence is relative to the history and experi-ence of his people. Moreover, to a mystic, the animist’sapproach seems sounder than that of the skeptic. A life of re-spect toward any aspect of existence is a way that leads toheaven and back to God. In heaven, the respect shown tothis, that, and the other spirit opens up into the spirit of God.For this reason, the mystic Swedenborg, writing in the 1700s,said the blacks of Africa were favored by angels in heaven be-cause they were so amenable to learning the reality of thespiritual world, while Christians in heaven, who were proudof their “superior” understanding, did not do so well ( Heaven and Hell §326–328). We seem to be in a realm of relative realities in this life. Those who see everyone as crooks out to steal find their atti-tude confirmed.

We are free to confirm any of them. But the moment we begin to transcendthe human, we enter an objective realm. It is as it is. We canlearn to accept it as it is or run afoul of it. Many people do noteven know there are objective realms. We leave the relativity ofthe human realm and pass into the objective the moment weopen ourselves to what really is. The easiest example of the ob-jective is the material world—regardless of our hopes and fears,it is as it is. The influential psychologist Carl Jung even calleddreams objective because we cannot create them; they are sim-ply given to us. In meditation, we enter the objective when welet things be and simply open ourselves to whatever is given tous. We cross into the objective when we say to God, “Let yourwill be done.” In the relative human realm, we effortlessly ordeliberately set the reality we choose to find.

It is used here in its root meaning, “to be filled with light.” Afew have foolishly thought enlightenment means to see lightwithin. The light of God is understanding, that is, being filledwith the sacred presence of God, which fills the person withthe joyous light of understanding. In the context of the design of existence, enlightenment represents some degree of the individual returning to theOne, even for a brief time. In a relatively rich and full en-lightenment, the person could confirm aspects of the designpresented here since the design has emerged from mystics ofvarious traditions. All mystics who have published their expe-rience have contributed to our understanding of the design.Some of the greatest ones are the authors of the Hindu Up-anishads, set down from an earlier oral tradition in 400 BCE.1 As we have seen, the Western mystic Emanuel Swedenborghelped particularly in describing heaven and hell and the rela-tionship of spiritual worlds to our inner life.

The general agreement of mystics of alltimes, cultures, and religions arises because this is an objec-tive realm of what ultimately is. The elements universallyfound by the world’s mystics are these: (1) The One (given various names) is the All. (2) The One created all other levels of existence out of itself, as levels of its manifestation. These levels include us. (3) A moral life is an essential element of the return to the One in this life and in heaven. (4) There is a universal wish to return to and know God. Much of the return path is subtly built into our life. It is markedby a unique joy and pleasure. These common universal elements in mysticism form in themselves an outline of the design of it all. The One createsitself into existence to go through adventures and discoveriesto return to the One. Although mystics have discovered theoutline of the design, it contains much that is still unknown. There are several aspects that need clarification. Because enlightenment is the self-revealing of the One, it can only becreated by the One. It is necessary to bear this in mind or in-dividuals will try every possible stunt to create the experienceof the One.

Themain one is living a moral life in which we attempt to showrespect to others and to all things. In both my reading ofworld mystics and in contact with mystics, I have neverknown enlightenment to occur to someone leading an im-moral life. Morality is an attempt to keep the self in harmonywith all things, which is the foundation of a possible enlight-enment. Immorality disregards one’s own personhood andthat of others; we violate both ourselves and others. A life ofimmorality often makes the idea of God seem ridiculous. Thebasic teachings of Buddhism lay a foundation of morality asthe very first step toward enlightenment, the real goal ofBuddhism. Does this imply a moral perfection? No. That isperhaps impossible. The Divine sees our ends, what we at-tempt to do, quite well. So the essence of this process is atrue, consistent attempt to live a moral life, a life that showsrespect for ourselves and others.

By living a moral life, we are already attempting to be inharmony with all there is. Enlightenment is often preceded by a long-term attempt to know God. This can be through the religion of one’s cul-ture. Ramakrishna had enlightenment following the forms ofseveral very different major religions. 2Literate people will likely study the sacred texts of their faith to look at God’s rev-elation as a first attempt to know God, but the search for Godcould also function outside of any religion. Some may searchtheir relationships with others; others may search throughart. Artists often feel they are working with a higher inspira-tion. Their art is an attempt to get this out in a form that oth-ers can enjoy. I am convinced that the search may well have no apparent “God” in it. Some people’s “God” may be in social action orin work with plants and animals. If we look at the inner aspectof what such persons are attempting, we might find it to bemuch the same as a conventional search for God—reachingout for a higher realization that may be partly revealed andpartly concealed their whole life. In death, they will realize it.A friend of mine was a thorough atheist with a very scientificbent. He had an enlightenment in which he met the universalenergy, the force behind everything.

Differ-ent mysticisms have contributed different elements to ourunderstanding. There are also degrees of enlightenment. The most com- mon and lowest level is to sense the greater-than-yourself innature. Even this lowest level can intensify to a strong sense ofthe divine presence. Levels beyond this usually occur withsome loss of self or ego. This needs a little explaining. Thesense of the divine presence can be so strong that the sense ofself is overwhelmed or disappears. At a higher level, there maybe a union of the self and God, so no duality remains. There isonly the life of the Divine. Beyond this, the total order of ex-istence may be revealed, including the One and Only, how theOne formed out of itself the total order of existence, and howall existence returns to the One. The little self gradually re-covers self-awareness after such an experience. At the ultimate level, all duality ceases, even the duality of one’s self and God. En to pan: the One is the all. The mystical union of the person with God removes this basic duality onthe way to the ultimate experience of the One as all there is. Unfortunately, the full confirmation of the ultimate de- sign of existence—the ultimate level of enlightenment—israrely achieved. But, of course, we are dealing with enlighten-ment in people on earth. In heaven, the experience of the fullorder of existence is common at the celestial level, accordingto Swedenborg. In Heaven and Hell §§270–272, he writes that the angels in that sphere have little sense of personal identityand live in the experience of the Lord alone as the real.

In either case, the ego vanishes for a time.So, in Hinduism and Buddhism, all levels below Brahma orGod are maya, or degrees of illusion. God is substantially real, being all that really is; all else is relative, an idea we willexplore more later. So the ego or personal identity is a rela-tive and temporary reality that can vanish when the real truthstands forth. Similarly, God exists in all other people too.

Being in the land of multiple gods islike enjoying a vast garden with a pleasing variety of plantsand creatures. The variety itself is needed. It enriches thewhole. As we have said before, heaven is the harmony of infi-nite differences. When we look deeply into what others aretrying to do, can we recognize the same life, the same won-dering and seeking that exists in us? And even if we have nowonder and seeking, can we let others try in their own peace-ful ways? The desecration of a Jewish synagogue or burningof a black church upsets others, besides Jews and AfricanAmericans.

It is also a hierarchy of reality.As we approach the One, reality increases; and, in the otherdirection, falsity and illusion increase. In this hierarchy, onlythe One, the Divine, is substantially real, while all else is rela-tively real. Whatever approaches the One is relatively morereal; whatever leads away from the One is relatively unreal. Here is a simple but critical example. Religions them- selves are only relative realities. Because they arise out of aculture, religions can disappear without the people and cul-ture to support them. A religion’s reality or spiritual sub-stance rests on the quality of the lives of the people in it.However much theologians would like to think of their reli-gion as transcending all human contingencies, they do not. Ifall in a religion are scoundrels, the religion is dead. It is alsodead when no one believes or practices it. But there is adeeper relativity in religion. Insofar as it leads people to God,it has divine support. If it leads to false ideas, human vanity,and presumption, it has the seeds of its own death within it.So, in several ways, religions are relative realities that becomesubstantial insofar as they lead back to the One. This is thebasic design of spiritual relativity. What leads toward God hasthe qualities of eternal life in it. What leads away from God istemporary and insubstantial. You can think of this as the willof God, but it is also in the very nature of things. I have not seen this enunciated before. When I first learned of this principle, I looked at hell in Swedenborg’s ex-periences. There were clear indications that hell is a kingdomof appearances, of falsities. 2It contains all that leads away 1 5 0 THE DESIGN OF EXISTENCE2. See Heaven and Hell §§113, 233, 487, 539, among others. Literally, hell is not as real as heaven, so heaven and hell are not really a duality of oppo- sites. Heaven is ultimately substantial, whereas hell is closer to a bad movie."

We know that the body exists but only for ashort season, and it then deteriorates into the elements it wascomposed of. The spirit of a person is a greater reality thanthe body because it goes on after the body dies. But what ofthe life of a person is really substantial? Your love of life isspiritually substantial because it continues forever. You willrecall that, according to Swedenborg, the spiritual world weenter immediately after dying sorts us out into levels ofheaven and hell. The real “I”, even if we have only a vaguenotion of it, determines our place in the worlds beyond thisone. So this real “I” transcends all our lesser notions, hopes,and fears, all the clutter of our ideas and opinions. The levelsof heaven are themselves arranged in an order of greater real-ity from a level similar to the natural world, to the spiritualheaven of those who love their neighbor, to the celestialheaven where God is the central reality. The levels of heavenare themselves steps up in relative reality because they are de-grees of approach to God.

KARMA AND REINCARNATION Between the Western and Eastern religions, there exists amajor disagreement on the topics of karma and reincarnation.Even Christianity has signs of reincarnation, but this is morecommon in the older religions. Karma and reincarnation areprominent in Hinduism, Buddhism, and in the Sikh and Jainreligions. The first confusing element is that, in common usage, a doctrine that is at least partly false even within the major reli-gions is widely accepted. Let us call this “the common view.”In this view, karma is an inexorable law by which our deedshave effects; we are restricted or elevated by these effects.Upon dying, we go to a world in which our karma determinesif we will be born again as a human or even as another sort ofcreature. This round of successive rebirths is seen as part of acosmic process in which the soul is given a chance eventuallyto become wiser and free from the round of birth and death.This, then, is roughly the common view. Differences exist inwhether a religion sees transmigration as possible (a personcan come back as any life form) or only reincarnation (peoplereturn as people, with each round, of course, starting over in 1 5 2 THE DESIGN OF EXISTENCE"

When we look closer, karma stands up to scrutiny; but, even under Eastern teaching, reincarnation does not. Why isthis important? In this book, I have taken as my standardSwedenborg’s report of years of experience in heaven andhell. Swedenborg’s extensive spiritual experience found no ev-idence whatsoever for reincarnation. In fact, he came up witha reason that people may believe in reincarnation even whenit doesn’t exist. But Eastern religions’ theory of reincarnationdirectly contrasts to Swedenborg’s 27 years of experience inheaven and hell. Moreover, this is a marked difference be-tween the Eastern and Western religions in general, at leastas we have come to know them in the modern era, a differ-ence in a critical area. Do we go on in spiritual worlds, or dowe return to this life again and again? Let us first examine karma. The word is from the San- skrit, meaning action or deed. In the simplest terms, karmameans that we reap what we sow. It is not a matter of God’sjudgment but is an automatic process. What we do has effectsthat affect the doer. In some ways, we are bound and limitedby our past choices. This is karma. When linked to reincarna-tion, the sum total of our karma determines whether we re-turn to live another life or not.

People often think of karma as a sort of blessing or even a matter of luck, which has outward results: “He is rich, so hemust have good karma.” But karma is a more powerful ideawhen looked at in an inner and spiritual way: “He is out-wardly rich, but inwardly so badly off that I would not tradeplaces with him.” In an inner sense, people who have practi-cally nothing can be very wealthy in the spiritual quality andrichness of their life. This is often true of saints. In the innerrealm of real-life experience, we can more easily see karma atwork. One can do an entire book just tracing the personal ef- fects of karma, as is often done in novels.

Also all peoplewho have experienced enlightenment so enjoy the experiencethey seek more of it, which is to proceed away from ego to-ward the One. It is said there is no God in Buddhism.

The apparent sub-stantiality of this world is due to ignorance of the spiritualworlds. We might suggest that the idea of reincarnation arosebecause of a lack of understanding of the spiritual. In all reli-gions, there is a general belief that the human goes on—buthow? Since the only world we see is this physical world, itmust be that we come back to it.

There has been such an emphasis on the human in this de- sign that it is appropriate to ask whether the design applies toplants, animals, rocks, and all the rest of creation? The answeris yes. The human is at the center of involvement in the de-sign; but, because plants and animals live in their natural givenorder, they are less “lost” than humans. We have the freedomto question, examine, choose this or that. In a real sense, wehumans have both the richest possibilities and hence thegreatest possibility of losing our true way. A rock is an excel-lent example of an aspect of creation that is thoroughly in itsnatural order. In contrast, humans will endlessly debate andsearch for this order. But while humans are the most lost as-pect of creation, they are also a better window into the overalldesign. So, in a deep spiritual sense, all but humans are takencare of through their inner, natural order. They are as theyshould be. They express the divine order very well. So it isparadoxical. Although all of the natural order is in and displaysthe divine order, humans—the most lost part of creation—consider themselves superior to the rest of creation. Deep inmystical experience, it is easy to see all the rest of creation ismarvelously full of God. So, our return to God is problematic,but the rest of creation is in its order. Do plants and animalssurvive death? We may as well ask if we survive bodily death.The life in plants and animals survives for it is the One. It ispossible to see the hierarchy of heaven reaching toward thecelestial as a sign that our little selves are not substantial. Atthe celestial level, there is the strong experience that only Godexists. The little self can expand into the All, which is the basicexperience of enlightenment. LIVING IN THE DESIGN 1 6 7"

THEINTERNAL /EXTERNAL DIMENSION Many people hardly know they have an internal dimension,let alone what it is or how it works. Problems in this areaarise because we often take the external things-of-this-worldas the real person, similar to regarding actors on stage, whileplaying their roles, as the real character. But if we sat andtalked with them, without costume and makeup, we wouldsoon learn there was a real and very different person behindthe role. We tend to play a role when we are with others andespecially when we want to impress them or get somethingout of them. As we move from the outer role of a person to the person within, we often run into what that person feels is his or herreal problem. It may be a spouse or a health issue. Somehowthings are holding the person down. Behind this problem isthe casual, more natural person. In this more interior levelare dreams, which are nightly bulletins on how we stand. Aswe move toward the interior, we move into a more affectiveor feelingful realm. Here are deeper hopes and fears andmore of the living aspects of our existence. At this level, theinner can seem somewhat irrational. Strict logic is outside; itis part of the actor’s role. Inside, in the feeling realm, thingsconnect in an amazing way. A smell reminds one of a childhood incident. One suddenly feels tearful about a deadrelative.

It is ideal if the person can con-tact the inner wisdom to solve some of the outer problems. Insuch a case, we really have everything we need. For all prob-lems, consult the wisdom within. Meditation leads to thisinner realm. Spiritual practice also opens it. The wisdom in usis to be brought out and used to improve our life and the livesof others. What a paradox we really are—thick as a brick onthe outside but wise within. Might it be dangerous to bringthe wisdom out? Some will not understand; a few might wantto lock us up. Actually, the wisdom within knows all the cir-cumstances of our life better than we do. Its aim is to manifestin whatever are our circumstances. So it is not strange or alien. Now, how can all this be related to the religious life? Re- ligions vary widely in their understanding of the wisdomwithin.

The best way is to re-flect on the ceremony, on how it affects each of us, because,ultimately, churches are for our benefit.

It is really a matter of re-flecting on the design to see it. We have spoken much of the“spiritual”—a term that means nothing to some, irritates oth-ers, and seems alien territory to many.

You think, “I lovegardening. If heaven is anything like this—taking care ofthings so they show a harmony of beauty—I’ll do okay.” Herethere is simple shift from a mundane question of which plantsneed water and care to an examination of one’s preferred rolein eternity. This is not a big shift. You could notice plantslooking droopy and get them more water while reflecting onthis. Yet this simple incident reflects all seven aspects of thespiritual above. How does it reflect number 1, the inner life?Recognizing what you love is a recognition of your inner ten-dencies. Having reached into the spiritual while gardening,you could use gardening to explore your loves. This processwould probably even aid the quality of garden work. It slowsdown work to a more enjoyable and reflective pace. Theplants get more consideration. Your enjoyment might causeyou to work longer. Can a gardener enter the spiritual as sim-ply as this? Yes, of course. It is only a shift to a wider consid-eration of significance for the person.

Those who believe that rewardsfor good conduct will be received only in the next world havenot looked closely enough. Rewards are very much here and in the next world. If we have a class of ten children who are to be taught spirituality, we might first distinguish good and bad as whatjoins us in love versus what hurts and sets us apart. Each childmight be asked to do something mildly hurtful to each otherand then to trace its effects over subsequent days. Then eachchild might be asked to try something more loving and con-siderate and to trace out its effects. The differences would beobvious. This experiment differs from ordinary life experi-ence only in the careful observation of the effect on ourselvesand on others. Spirituality is that simple and obvious. A life-time of attempting to live a good life has very obvious re-wards in this life. A good life is not simple; it is a search initself. But a searching life is one that opens into otherpossibilities. Those not attempting a religious life while in the world often get an odd view of what such a life involves.

The main evidence forthe existence of the One is the experience of mystics of vari-ous traditions. The Upanishads affirm various ancient mys-tics’s experience of the One.

His discoveries have now received some confirma-tion from the near-death experience and from some clinicalfindings. Because we now know how Swedenborg enteredheaven and hell, others could retrace his steps, although theway will be difficult and dangerous. Both Eastern mystics and Swedenborg report how our in- ternals relate to the spiritual worlds beyond this. For simplic-ity, I reported Swedenborg’s discovery of how heaven and hellrelate to our internals, even though this could have been donefrom a host of mystics of various faiths. It was simpler andclearer to report it from Swedenborg. Meditation and ways of attempting to know God directly came mainly from Hinduism and Buddhism. Swedenborg’swork is weak on spiritual practices, but Hinduism andBuddhism are world leaders in this regard. So, basically, Iborrowed from many mystics to create as clear and under-standable a design as possible. 1 8 4 POSTSCRIPT"

      "text": "I would be pleased if the idea of an overall design of exis- tence was accepted and others, drawing on their and other mystics’s experiences, would fill in some of the remainingmysteries. Guesswork and speculation are not permitted.Real answers are given to us by God. It is clear that we do notknow it all. Yet isn’t it a wonder that it is possible to elaborateeven this much of the whole design of existence? One does not look at the design of existence without coming to feel small and inadequate. Without considerableguidance from the One, this entire task would simply be be-yond me. What is the most critical aspect of this design? It is the slow, inexorable process in which our day-to-day choices inthis world set our eternity. And this eternity is not far off inthe someday, after we die. If we reflect on it, our heaven orhell can begin to be seen here. All religions preach this essen-tial aspect: they all say to do good. But what is good? We know in part, but it rests, to a de- gree, on what we are trying to do, our real ends. If we arehonest, we are always near mystery. But this mystery onlyasks that we seek to do good and seek to be shown more ofthe good. This design is not a matter of hard, inexorable laws.Rather the entire design is partly human, like us. The humanside of the One is shown in various incarnations. We aremade in the image. I hope that one day the idea of an overall design of existence will be accepted and taught as part of each person’scultural heritage. This could be aided by simple exercises inwhich each individual would be encouraged to test and con-firm aspects of the design for him- or herself. This would notsubstitute for religion but rather be known as the heart of allreligions. POSTSCRIPT 1 8 5"

When this occurs, the process has itsown light. For, after all, it was the One that was sent into theworld as a helpless infant. The same One designed the way toreturn home. The whole process of seeking and finding is acosmic adventure. Being aware of the design and its implica-tions for us is another light on the way and the reason for thisbook. 1 8 6 POSTSCRIPT"
