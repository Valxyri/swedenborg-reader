It awakens all the depths of confused thoughts surrounding the fantastic image of a singular personage, less defined by history than created by literature. I confess that until recently all I knew of him was the remains of readings of many years ago. Seraphitus-Seraphita, by Balzac and a chapter of Gerard de Ner­ val had previously been my only sources, and into these I had not dipped for some thirty years. This fading recollection, nevertheless, retained a charm for me. The simple syllabic resonance of the magic name, when I chanced to hear it, evoked memories of incredible associations, of the fascina­ tions of a chimerical science, of the marvel of the considerable influ­ ence emanating from reveries; in a word, I loved to picture the uncertain figure of the seer in the frame of the century in which I would choose to have lived. I think to myself that his epoch was one of the most brilliant and whole that humanity can know. Therein we find the scintillating fi­ nale of one world and the strenuous birth pangs of another, the most refined art, all the forces and graces of the spirit. There was magic and differential calculus, the most cynical of the cynics, and the most Vtt"

All the themes of limitless intellectual curiosity that the Re­ naissance had recaptured from the ancients or drawn from its own euphoria reappear in the eighteenth century more alive, sharper, and more preCIse. Europe, then, accepts the coexistence of mutually contradictory systems. That is the characteristic of a \"modern\" type of civilization. Rome and Alexandria had already known such an accumulation of contradictory theses, publicly manifested and debated. In these an­ cient capitals, the diversity of cults and philosophies were in ferment: no one could ignore, in those environments of fiery intellectualism, the fact that every speculative question had more than one answer. The end product of such relationships and exchanges, often visible in a specific individual, incarnates the disorder and richness of an era. In the eighteenth century, while the d' Alemberts, the Clairauts, the Eulers were building a rigorously antiseptic, mechanical world on the foundation of entirely novel resources of mathematical analysis; while others researched biology, visualizing diverse philosophies of living nature and striving to trace the origins of what they believed about matter; while the great Linnaeus undertook the immense task of classifying all living organisms, others elaborated diverse meta­ physics-still in the footsteps of the ancients--or extrapolated from Gassendi, Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, or Malebranche. In the theo­ logical camp, Jansenists, Quietists, and many of other hues disputed among themselves the possession of truth and the empire of souls. Thus, there was no dearth of vigorous spirits. But if freedom of inquiry-having become almost legitimate everywhere-if the progress of the exact sciences, their stunning suc­ cess, and the discovery of the entire shape of the world had created a kind of encyclopedic appetite-an attitude that rejected nothing­ this same thirst for knowledge and power did not disdain the explo­ ration of the intellectual penumbra even into those suspect shadows in which, from the most remote antiquity, the imagination of a larger number of individuals locates the wellspring of power and knowl­ edge and the source of secrets of supernatural importance.

Men like Leibniz or Boyle may appear to us to be too rich in concerns that are too disparate; and the association, in Newton, of the interpretation of the Apocalypse (by way of hy­ potheses on the astronomy of the Argonauts) with the formulation of the mathematics of fluxion and the theory of universal attraction dis­ concerts us. But their century abounds in research in all disciplines; and the necessary passion, the cultivation of observation and experi­ ment, does not deliver them from the temptations offered by doc­ trines and practices mysteriously transmitted. (I observe in passing that the most prudent and the most positive science of those who dedicate themselves to it with the ardor that leads to discovery demands a certain thirst for marvels. The prodi­ gious, the unexpected, deriving from rigorous deduction or a faultless experimental procedure, endows the mind with one of the deepest joys anyone can know.) We find, therefore, in the eighteenth century, the generaliza­ tion, almost the vulgarization, of both normal and degenerate vari­ eties, which kindle the desire to know more than one can know. Adepts multiply, initiates abound, charlatans swarm. The social and political role of the occult becomes immense. Credulity and skepticism have never been as closely associated and as impartially distributed among the human race as they then were. The symbolism that decodes the universe like a hieroglyphic text; the hermeneutics that attributes to the Scriptures an interpreta­ tion more profound than the sense of the letter; the theosophy that awaits and receives communication from an immediate light; and­ still more daring, more disturbing, and ambitious in their operating procedures-magic, alchemy, divination by stars, by dreams, by evo­ cation-all coexist in more than one spirit along with the most limpid culture and the discipline of the exact sciences. Such is the·mental environment, the intellectual theater, that the name Swedenborg recalls to me.

But the book I have just read turns my thoughts to an entirely different Sweden borg. The vague and Hoffmanesque idea that my ignorance formed of this man is transformed into that of a figure no less enigmatic, but precise-powerfully interesting, whose intellec­ tual history enlivens a quantity of problems of first importance in the domain of the psychology of consciousness. I have read the work of Martin Lamm with an increasing eager­ ness. There I saw take form, in chapter after chapter, the extraordi­ nary romance of a \"second life.\" I say \"romance\" because, during my reading, I naively felt that intense eagerness for the sequel, that thirst for the future by which we are ordinarily carried away in the produc­ tions aimed at making us anticipate the delights of adventure. Of course, the adventure in question is not one of those whose recital intoxicates and captivates the immense majority of readers: it unfolds in the most private domains of the inmost life and on the un­ marked frontiers where the forces, the ambitions, the lights within us manifest themselves, opposing one another as they oppose, on the other hand, the ordinary phenomena of the \"external world.\" But in my personal opinion, it is not tales of voyages to the periphery of real­ ity, recitals of marvels, epic or dramatic narrations that lead to the study of the inexhaustible creator and universal transformer that we call Spirit. The Swedenborg to whom Martin Lamm's book introduces me is a being who has known, experienced, and traversed all the states or phases of the most intense and most complete physical life, since he appears to have scoured the intellectual spectrum even to certain ex­ tremes that might be called abnormal if this term-a purely negative one to my mind--did not introduce too summary or too simple a judgment. The analysis of his successive works, masterfully handled by the author, presents the development of a prestigious case that any­ one, according to the nature of his own mind, can meditate upon and interpret in his own way; be he a historian, a psychiatrist, a mystic­ even a poet-he can study, comment upon, admire, or classify at will. x"

He will give respectful consideration to the sum of knowl­ edge, the quality of the work, and the intellectual vigor that an exam­ ination and exposition of the whole of the enormous work of Swedenborg requires. This labor is, I imagine, one that is neither constantly pleasant nor easy, although we find, in places, bits of great poetic beauty, delicious visions appearing to transcendental infancy. But it contributes an incomparable document of interest that I would never have even suspected without the effort to which Lamm has gone to reduce to essentials an immense amount of material and to guide us among the Swedenborgian infernos and paradises. In his preface, he modestly reduces his role to the study of the origins of the theosophy of Swedenborg, a task in which he became engaged in the course of his researches regarding \"the mystical-sentimental current in Swedish eighteenth-century literature which opens the way for Romanticism and later merges with it.\" But he will be found, I think, to have delineated a unique personage in the great drama of the human spirit. That is not all. A book, to my eyes, has value according to the number and the novelty of the problems it creates, stimulates, or re­ animates in my mind. Works that demand or postulate the passivity of the reader are not to my taste. I expect my readings to generate such comments, reflections, such sudden arrests that suspend consid­ eration, illuminate perspectives, and suddenly reawaken our pro­ found curiosity, the particular interests of our personal researches, and the direct feeling of our fully alive involvement. So, in a few words, I am going to try to give an idea of some of the emerging questions that Martin Lamm's book calls forth in me. Swedenborg appears to me to have been the exemplar and the subject of one of the most remarkable and complete internal transfor­ mations.

Nevertheless, how does one pass from a mechanistic view of the world and from habits ingrained by the practice of precise observations of natural science to meditations of theological origin, to the focusing of thought upon questions derived from Scripture and tradition? How does this displacement of values come about? Even so, it is not that ordinary attention is transferred from one object to another or that a certain custom of theoretical thought is substituted for another. We find a little later that a rarer and more profound alteration becomes pronounced: from the theoretical and speculative phase, busied with reasonings about the dogma of the Fall or about the nature of angels, Swedenborg advances to another state in which it is not the ideas themselves that are in question, but conscious­ ness itself. The theoretical phase is succeeded by one in which interior happenings occur that do not possess the purely transitory and plausi­ ble character of ordinary thought, but which introduce into the con­ sciousness an awareness of forces and presences that are apart from the self, that stand before him, not as responses or arguments or ordinary intuitions, but as phenomena. So we see dissertation and dialectic re­ placed by reporting and description; that is to say, the conditions and means of intellectual research-doubt, formulation of the plurality of possibilities, choice, demonstration, etc.-are dispossessed by a per­ ception that carries immediate and invincible certitude. This kind of certitude is not comparable to that expressed by the term \"evidence\": evidence, after all, is a reaction of our mind in which we recognize ourselves, while mystic certitude stems from the impression of an exis­ tence independent of self, which objects and tangible bodies com­ monly give us; that impress themselves upon us as long as they are alien to us. That is why this introduction of forces and presences just \" Editor's Note. Swedenborg is usually thought to have had his first mystical experience in his mid-fifties. xu"

But with Sweden borg, theoretical activity does not entirely van­ ish in the face of direct perception. It resumes its role of construction and justification. It is natural for a mind so strongly endowed and cultivated to establish between his two realities relations that are as systematic as possible, and he constitutes a type of method to which a quasi-scientific framework can be attributed. That is what Sweden­ borg has done with his famous theory of correspondences, in which he combined several metaphysical, Kabbalistic, or magical traditions, with their initial rationalism, on the one hand, and the discoveries which the awakening of his new faculty offers him on the other. This theory enables him to construct a tabulation, a dictionary, in which, to each object of ordinary world experience or each word of common language, a being or object in the \"spiritual\" world re­ sponds. Physical laws themselves are to be translated in \"spiritual\" terms. Here is another question posed by the reading of Martin Lamm's book. What is to be understood by the word spiritual? I might easily have passed this over and allowed myself to believe that I understood it. I have heard the term a thousand times. I have used it times without number. But here I find in it a scope and importance that demand a pause. I said to myself: ordinary philosophical vocabulary allows me the vice of necessarily appropriating the appearance of a technical language, although truly precise definitions are no less necessarily lacking-for there are only precise instrumental definitions (that is, they are reduced to actions, like displaying an object or performing an operation). It is impossible to guarantee that a unique, uniform, and constant sense can be attributed to words like reason, universe, cause, matter, or idea.

Here the value attributed to the elements of discourse is not merely a personal one, but one arising from exceptional moments or states of the sub­ ject. It is not only that it lacks independence from the subject who thinks and speaks, but it even depends upon his state. Besides, among mystics, the sense perceptions themselves receive values no less singu­ lar than those attached to words. A fortuitous sound or (as occurred with Jacob Boehme) a reflection from a tin plate is not limited to what it is and the association of ideas that can be derived from them: they assume the force of a happening, and by its actio praesentiae, they become \"catalysts,\" provoking a change of state. So the subject passes into his second life without difficulty-as though the initial phenomenon were a common element, a point of contact or of the welding of two \"universes.\" That is the way of essential terms among the mystics. They have one meaning according to which they belong in the dictionary of common usage, and another meaning whose resonance only develops in the domain of the \"internals\" of a specific person. The ambivalence of this double function results in the facility of passage from the nor­ mal to the privileged state, the effortless going and coming between two worlds. This latter remark seems important to me: it permits us to avoid confusing mysticism with delirium. Delirium blends worlds and values: mysticism of Swedenborg's type discriminates to the point of presenting the table of their correspondences as a problem and a task. Moreover, his activities in the ordinary world, his rela­ tions with its beings and objects, are perfectly normal and irreproach­ ably conventional. In the case under consideration, spiritual is a key word, the sig­ nificance of which is a resonance. It does not bring to mind the object of thought. It responds to the need of expressing that what one says does not have its aim or value in what one sees; furthermore, it indi­ cates that what one thinks has neither its aim nor its value in what can be thought.

The \"spiritual\" world gives the visible world its true meaning, but is itself only the symbolic expression of an essential, inaccessible world where the dis­ tinction between \"being\" and \"awareness\" ceases. The principal fact (for the psychologist) that all this proposes for study is the following: someone experiences and assures himself that his thought might manifest something other than the thought itself. The mystic or spiritual event is par excellence the presumed introduc­ tion or intervention of quasi-phenomena, of impulsive forces, of judgments, etc., in the group of attributes of a self, that the self does not recognize as its own, which it can only attribute to an other-in the domain where there is normally no other, the invisible domain of the self. No doubt what is produced in us is often enough a surprise for us; and it astonishes us sometimes by a superior quality; sometimes, on the contrary, by a weakness or a deficiency that reveals itself. We find ourselves now more, now less than \"ourselves.\" But we do not, nevertheless, cease to attribute these digressions to some more or less intimate or functional origin, as we do when an unexpected bodily sensation surprises us. A sudden pain transforms our idea of our­ selves just as does a flash of exquisite pleasure, but it never occurs to us that these incidents or occurrences are not of our own substance, of which they are only a rarely induced faculty. The mystic, however, feels the externality, or rather the extraneousness, of the source of im­ ages, of emotions, of words, of impulses that reach him by an internal route. He is constrained to grant them the force of reality; but as he cannot confuse this reality with the reality of everybody, his life is a pro­ gression between two universes of equal existence, but of very un­ equal importance.

These produc­ tions are strange, no doubt; but not so strange that one could not rec­ ognize upon reflection the elements borrowed from ordinary life experience. How could he fail to see that our spiritual formations are part of the group of combinations that can be composed in us on the basis of our sensory acquisitions and of our psychic and affective pos­ sibilities and freedoms? While Swedenborg the scholar had surely considered the sensory world as the superficial aspect of a psychome­ chanical world, according to Descartes or Newton, Swedenborg the mystic considered this superficial sensory aspect of naive intuition as the expression of a \"spiritual\" world. If, then, this spiritual world is re­ vealed by some supernatural power, this power chose to express in Swe­ denborg the appearances that were suitable to teach any untutored person. I have italicized these words; but I can insist still more strongly upon the idea that they express by means of the following remark: the most extravagant vision of a visionary can always be brought back or traced to a single deformation of observable reality, with preserva­ tion of the conditions of consciousness, and this vision can, moreover, be described in terms of ordinary language. But let us think about the structure and form of the universe that the tools of mathematics and instruments of science offer us today. There, on the one hand, results are positive, because they refer to the powers of action; on the other, they penetrate the unintelligible, shake the venerable \"categories of understanding,\" disparage even the notions of law and cause-to the extent that the ancient \"reality\" of yore becomes a simple statistical effect, although the imagination itself, producer of all \"visions\" possi­ ble, and the \"usual language,\" their means of expression, find them­ selves paralyzed, incapable of communicating to us what our instruments and calculations oblige us to try to think about.

I have spoken of all this only to insist on the question that I con­ sider essential in this case: how is a Swedenborg possible? What must be assumed to consider the coexistence of the qualities of a learned engineer, of an eminent government official, of a man wise in practi­ cal matters and learned in every field, with the characteristics of a vi­ sionary who has no hesitation in writing out and publishing his visions, in allowing himself to be known as one visited by the inhabi­ tants of another world, taught by them, and living a part of his life in their mysterious company? Moreover, it is certainly insufficient to speak only of coexistence: it is necessary also to take note of a certain collaboration, the most re­ markable and astonishing example of which is given by the doctrine of representations and correspondences. It is hard for me to believe that this work was not thought out and composed by an author more systematic and master of himself than one inspired and lost in contemplation. The concern for order, the drive and painstaking definition, the well-arranged introduction of new ideas are very apparent and must have demanded a consider­ able logical labor, which contrasts curiously with the content of dreams. But more extraordinary yet is the part of this system where Swedenborg develops the correspondences of organs and mem­ branes. There he displays remarkably precise and detailed anatomi­ cal knowledge, and he expresses himself like a man who has deeply reflected about the problems of physiology, knowledge, and reflec­ tions of which he makes use to interrelate all the parts of the organ­ ism, the strangest significances, evaluations, or \"spiritual\" creations.

Swedenborg himself answered anxious questioners about his own faith in his personal illuminations by saying, \"Haec vera sunt quia signum habeo\" (These are truths because I have the sign). The \"sign\" sufficed to dissipate all internal resistance and to consecrate the intimate union between Swedenborg the rationalist, physicist, practical and social man, with the familiar of spirits and confidant of angels. These sublime and marvelous relations did not in the least embarrass him in his extensive social contacts, and he maintained these as he maintained an honest man's relationships with his con­ temporaries, just as casually and habitually as anyone who frequents different \"social circles\" (such as those of business and those of recre­ ation) sustains and interrelates their varying activities. The nature of this \"sign\" is not explained to us. His silence may be attributed to fear of seeing this basis of inmost life contested, or perhaps lest the virtue of the sign and its secret should vanish. But also the very difficulty of describing it would have constrained him to keep silence about it. It is common knowledge that whatever fixes our mind on a certainty is indefinable.

If we receive from an external source something for which we have an intense desire, it seems to us that this thing that satisfies us so perfectly is as though produced by our own desire.

The \"sign\" of Sweden borg was perhaps only the sensation of en­ ergy, of a fullness of happiness and well-being that he always felt when giving himself up to the production and organization of his spiritual world, and the certitude of his creative delights could no doubt suffice to defer his doubts indefinitely and to rein his critical sense. Yes, the Swedenborg case proposes to us, it seems, certain al­ leged facts that boil down neither to mystic vision nor to the avowed existence of a particular sign. This sign metamorphoses from a thought, at first quite scientific and meta physico-theological, into an intuitive \"second reality,\" and is worked by degrees into a transcendental doctrine. And these degrees are marked by properly hallucinatory \"subjective\" occurrences, of which the scene in the London inn is entirely characteristic. Must the account of it by the theosopher himself be accepted as correct? The importance of this question will be seen. The correct­ ness I have in mind is not that which depends upon Swedenborg's good faith. Let us accept that as integral. But the most sincere man in the world, expressing what he has seen, particularly what he has seen in the domain where he alone could have seen it, inevitably alters this condition of singularity merely by the use of ordinary language, which adds to the no less inevitable alteration due to the act of direct mem­ ory, that results from the fragmentation into words and the laws of combination or form of syntax. In the order of practical communica­ tion, these alterations are generally negligible and are rectified, more­ over, by common experience: the common sensory environment verifies the accord of our signals.

The dream is a hypothesis, because we never know it except as a memory, but this memory is necessarily a structured one. We con­ struct and redesign our dream; we express it, we attribute a sense to it, it becomes tellable: history, scenes, role of personages, and in the scenario of recollections the role of the awakening, the recognition, are indiscernible. It happens that we recount this dream: the hearer translates the recital in turn according to his own system of images: if the study of dreams piques him, he will reason on the basis of what he imagines, which is a transmutation of a transmutation. The translation of a translation may well conserve something, but not what cannot be verbalized. What cannot be spoken is precisely what is important for us to grasp; that which would give us some idea of what consciousness while asleep can be; the production and substitu­ tion of quasi-phenomena, the perpetual aborning state of a mental life of no return, which is essentially instantaneous. But to speculate about the recitation of a dream is to operate on the result of an activity of the night before, the hypothetical original having lost the substance of its nature and become an abstract reconstruction-like a statue that no longer presents the intimate causal relation between the form and the living matter of the model. In sum: we reason on the schema of a totally consummated event, and we interpret it; but a schema is the result of sundry acts, and these acts are those of the waking state; it must be \"awakened\" to express. But suppose that we should try, on the other hand, to modify voluntarily our waking perceptions and representations so as to di­ minish their significative effect, to exhaust their transitive and con­ ventional effect (as happens in the case of a word repeated until it loses its meaning). We then observe some features of a state of which the dream state might be the limit. Moreover, we observe quite clearly, when we feel the mind overcome by sleep, that we waver in some way between two worlds, the stronger of which dissolves grad­ ually into the weaker. Then we see take form the manner of transfor­ mation of consciousness that will rule in the dream universe. Admitting (for purely hypothetical purposes) that this universe is xx"

Analogous characteristics, I think, must be found in \"visions.\" The modes of transformation of appearances there must strongly re­ semble those of our dreams. There we have what I believe I have ver­ ified in some cases by careful study of certain accounts by visionaries selected from the most naive examples. This means, in effect, that the document emanates from a subject as poorly educated, and also as unimaginative as possible, in order that the production of images be as free as possible from secondary motives and corrections. With regard to Sweden borg, the conditions are entirely the op­ posite, and they are very unfavorable for an examination of the de­ gree of precision in the report he has recorded for us in his writings. Indeed, certain details of the celebrated vision in London seem to me to be of the kind that \"are not invented,\" that is, which seem to me to be impossible to represent a desire, preceded by an intent, to respond to some conscious demand. I have allowed myself to delve into considerations of which it is only necessary to remember this: that I would never finish were I to pursue all the questions with which Martin Lamm's book deals. I began without suspecting that I was entering an enchanted forest where every step raised sudden flights of ideas; where avenues of brilliant hypotheses proliferated, of psychological ambushes and echoes; where each glance reveals perspectives bristling with enig­ mas; where the intellectual visitor is infected with excitement, strays, loses, finds the trail, and loses it again. But this is not at all to waste one's time. I love the hunt for hunting's sake, and there are few hunts more rewarding than the hunt for the mystery of Swedenborg. XXI"

When it then became a matter of closer treatment of the doctrine of Swedenborg and its important role in Sweden as well as abroad, I soon became aware of the fact that it was impossible to base it on earlier accounts. It also be­ came evident that Sweden borg's system remains unintelligible with­ out establishing its relation to the philosophical concepts developed in his works on physical and natural sciences, on which it is founded. I was, therefore, compelled to examine more closely the genesis of Swedenborgian theosophy: here I bring the result of these researches, and I hope that, despite its inadequacy, this work can be of some use to future scholars in a field still very much neglected in my country. It is apparent how my subject is thereby restricted. I have said nothing of the importance of Sweden borg to his contemporaries and to posterity, cherishing the hope of a discussion of it in detail in an­ other context. Of Sweden borg's biography, I have only included what has seemed to me to be necessary to clarify his religious development.

One often finds unverified hypotheses put forth according to which Swedenborg appears to rely upon such-or-such an author. In general, it has seemed to me superfluous to discuss them.

Lawrence The publication in the English-speaking world of Martin Lamm's seminal work on Swedenborg is much more significant than it might appear upon a casual glance through the volume. Lamm's treatise is significant not only because it represents the most important schol­ arly study on Swedenborg ever undertaken in his native land and continues to be regarded in European academic circles as the corner­ stone of scholarship on Swedenborg, but also because it provides a highly provocative thesis-namely, that Swedenborg's theological system (and in particular the \"science of correspondences\") was al­ ready developed before his supposed illumination and prophetic call­ ing. In fact, Lamm believes that, however interesting it may be for students of the paranormal, Swedenborg's famed mode of revelatory perception--of \"things seen and heard\"-was completely unneces­ sary as a means of insight, because all of his core concepts had been developed and were at-hand when he began his theological works. For the scholarly study of Swedenborg, Lamm's perspective is one that must be engaged and weighed against other views.

Alfred Acton developed the most accepted view for those in the various branches of the New Jerusalem churches in his An Introduc­ tion to the Word Explained: A Study of the Means by which Swedenborg the Scientist Became the Theologian and Revelator (Bryn Athyn, Penna.: Academy of the New Church, 1927). The main purpose of Acton's work is to show how Swedenborg was prepared by God to become a Christian revelator appropriate for the modern era. Often simply referred to as \"Sweden borg's preparation,\" Swedenborg's sci­ entific period is regarded as creating a general structure of rational thought capable of supporting a reasonable system of religious values, communicated expressly by the Lord, usually through the agency of angels. These ideas and values would become the \"heavenly doc­ trines\"-a revelatory body of work that in some ways restored an­ cient understandings, but in some ways also presented a more sophisticated interpretation than any before grasped by humankind. Whereas Acton (and Lamm notes others such as Alfred Stroh) believes that scientific theories rendered general supportive structures for the theosophical ideas, Lamm's goal is to demonstrate that the two periods of Sweden borg's studies are so thoroughly continuous that there is really no leap in ideation that renders extrasensory reve­ latory experience as necessary. My own reading of Swedenborg's story is that Lamm's thesis does no damage to what most devout believers understand. The fact that something happened causing Swedenborg to cease scientific pur­ suits and to commit his attention exclusively to biblical and theologi­ cal discussions for the better part of the remaining three decades of his life is not undercut by the possibility that Swedenborg already un­ derstood a cosmology and ontology that would house the \"heavenly doctrines.\" Certainly, before the time of his calling, he had not felt the need to apply his developing philosophy to the Christian faith. How­ ever, Lamm's position does not adequately account for the fact that Swedenborg went into his theological phase with much \"old church\" conceptions of key doctrines, writing several exploratory works he did not publish which demonstrate that he still believed in a personified Devil; in a Godhead of three Persons; in the Creation XXVltt"

Some devoted Swedenborgians may feel dismay in Lamm's tone. He is clearly not an adherent of Swedenborg's religious system, and he makes it plainly evident that he does not believe Swedenborg's supposed seers hip has any important role in the actual ideas that flowed from his pen. But Sweden borg often remarked that divine providence uses the minds and works of people in ways that they do not themselves perceive. I feel this way about Martin Lamm. His work has brought a new depth of insight into how thoroughly Swe­ denborg's scientific effort prepared him to understand how the Bible could contain an inner sense. The aids Lamm brings in filling out the story of Swedenborg's training only deepens my awe of the seer's biography. On the other hand, Lamm's practical approach to Swedenborg's religious calling has its drawbacks. His treatment of the seer's \"reli­ gious crisis\" and mystical experiences is by far the weakest aspect of Lamm's investigation, and it is here that the scholar wanders out of his expertise. His analysis of Swedenborg's dream journal seems to be amateurish in the year 2000. When Lamm wrote this work, the mod­ ern understanding of dreams was in its infancy. Freud's first pub­ lished writings were only a decade old and had not penetrated the university realm. Carl Jung's work had scarcely begun. We now stand upon a full century of psychological investigation that has yielded a much advanced understanding of dream activity. What Lamm sees as bizarre and disjointed images and ideas in the dream journal, we now know to be a different kind of symbolic lan­ guage that occurs within everyone's mind during sleep. Swedenborg's dream journal is remarkable not for its sexual aspects or disturbing images-although, for the mid-eighteenth century, Swedenborg's own attempts at interpretation are astonishing in their perceptive­ ness, as is his ability to put his interpretations to practical use-but as a window to a soul about to be transformed. Lamm's attempts to diagnose Swedenborg's mental state in his supposed \"alert\" spiritual visions also seem beyond his professional ken.

It is significant that the name Swedenborg received at baptism is, according to his father's interpretation, meant to symbol­ ize the unio mystica, that \"secret union\" with God in and through faith, which constitutes the lifeblood of all Christian mysticism. All the biographies of Swedenborg agree in tracing to the pater­ nal home itself the prime origin of his evolution into a mystic. They point to the conformity between the character and philosophy of the father and that of the son with such persistence that one is tempted to react against the exaggerations of this thesis. It is beyond doubt that, in a general way, Jesper Swedberg and his son represent two rather different fundamental types in the gallery of religious personages. Despite these allowances, there remain enough essential traits com­ mon to both that it is hard to understand Emanuel Sweden borg without knowing his father. In his external appearance, Jesper Swedberg was typical of the upright pastors of the seventeenth century. He was a native of the Bergslag mining district, where, according to his own statement, in his youth everybody was dressed \"like honest and grave clergymen. \" It is with \"the heart filled with bitterness\" that he sees the elegant 3"

Nevertheless, this powerful preacher of the old stock, who him­ self relates how the dragoons of Charles XI, when for the first time they reported for examination on the catechism, cringed before him \"as they never trembled in the face of the enemy,\" hid beneath that stern surface the tender and childlike soul of a dreamer. Early in his life he had come in contact with Arndt and Scriver, German forerun­ ners of Pietism. These two theologians were particularly pleasing to his spirit because they demanded of their followers a true purity of conduct even more than a dogmatic faith, and their works breathed a warmth of feeling that he found lacking in the rigid, formal Protes­ tant orthodoxy of the seventeenth century. Swedberg also felt a live sympathy for what the Pietists' doc­ trine contained by way of mysticism, since, as he says of the works of Scriver, \"they lead us toward spiritual unity, to the holy and sacred mystic community with Jesus Christ.\"3 In the course of time, he also became acquainted with later Pietist authors and felt attracted to them, as well as to the serene devotion of Swedish Pietist circles with whom he found himself in touch, without ever considering himself as standing outside of orthodox Protestantism. The subtleties of dog­ matics were entirely alien to his spirit, and Tottie rightly takes note of his fundamental \"lack of scientific interest,\" his indifference with re­ spect to any attempt \"to justify to the mind the very essence of faith and to make of it, in the slightest degree, a matter of knowledge.\"4 He gave short shrift to any theological speculation with the ancient adage of Tertullian, \"credo quia absurdum,\" and, he said, \"I believe be­ cause this is impossible for me to understand and, even more so, to d \" o. This innocent purity of heart, reflected in his diary, is found in his sermons as well. These are both numerous and rather compen­ dious.

This assumed such proportions with him that the psychiatrist Gilbert Ballet appears seriously inclined to find therein a symptom of mental disorder. 5 As to form, the collections of sermons published by Jesper Swedberg are far from qualifying as a literary ef­ fort, and the same can be said of his hymns. But, as Schuck points out, as with the homiletic literature of the seventeenth century, they are distinguished by their subjectivism, by the absence of all dogmatic polemic, and by their practical spirit.6 In Swedberg's religious tracts, one finds no abstract or irksome com­ mentary: everything becomes simple and concrete. He modernizes the parable of the prodigal son with the same naivety and directness as of the school dramas of the Reformation: a fastidious young \"lord\" has delighted in lettres d'amour and harlot songs,\" instead of taking \"in hand the precious book of Sirach.\"7 And in his sermons, he will­ ingly abandons the text of the day to illustrate, by living examples drawn from his own experience, the teachings he especially wishes to engrave upon the minds of his hearers. Swedberg particularly loves to expatiate on the miracles or the apparitions of which he himself is the object or the witness. Thus, during Advent, while preaching about the Last Judgment, he points to the appearance in Sweden of a number of precursory signs that indicate that the time is near. He re­ calls \"the terrible great comet\" of 1680; he relates that three evenings in succession he has seen \"thick pools of blood large as tub bottoms\" floating in Lake Barken in Dalecarlia; he reminds the congregation of the recent earthquake in Vastergotland; he speaks \"of a woman who called herself Sophia\" who, during the summers of 1698 and 1699, traveled all through the Bergslag and Vastmanland, announc­ ing the approaching ruin of Sweden. But what appears to him, more than any other sign, to indicate the proximity of the Last Judgment, is that \"the brute creatures are bringing forth offspring wearing that of­ fensive headdress called 'fontang' which is extremely displeasing to God, the angels and to every pious man.\" It is thus that, on February 5"

The Pauline allegory on the lamentations of the creature is, for him, a truth so literal that he believes he hears the an­ imals everywhere, and even inanimate objects, lament over the sins of mankind. 9 \"For even the creature destitute of life or reason possesses a sensibility, an intelligence, and a voice.\" If a poacher plunders fish from a lake, it is found that the fish disappear; if apples are stolen from a tree, one will notice that it will no longer yield such rich har­ vests. Even household furnishings deplore the transgressions of man: \"It seems to me that, when one hears a sudden creaking of a chest or cupboard, this involves something that has suffered abuse. They be­ come alarmed and bemoan the triumph of a wickedness which of­ fends God and saddens the angels.\"lO But at the same time, nature is the herald of resurrection. When autumn comes, swallows plunge to the bottoms of lakes and remain there lifeless until the return of summer. If, after cutting down flow­ ers and plants and reducing them to powder, this is buried, it will be noticed that they grow up again as beautiful as before.

In the Holy City where the angels sing a new song and the bells are tolling in the king's palace. Oh, if we were only there! Oh, if we were only therePl It is around this \"Holy City\" that Jesper Swedberg's thoughts constantly revolve, and his ardent imagination tries to visualize the life that awaits him there. In the course of his voyage to Hamburg, when parting from the celebrated orientalist Edzardus, he asks him, in what language they will converse when they meet again in the realm of the heavens. His friend remains silent, so Swedberg adds, \"I believe it will be in the tongue of the angels. Just as angels converse with a Swede in Swedish, and German with a German, or in English 6"

In a Lenten sermon, Swed­ berg tells his flock that, in the kingdom of heaven, we shall regain \"our languages\" as well as \"all the knowledge that we have labori­ ously collected here below .... And I believe, for example, that when we converse with Abraham, and he with us, we shall speak our Swedish language, which he will understand, and he will reply in Hebrew, which we shall also understand. And when we talk with Saint Peter, we shall talk our Swedish language, and he will answer us in his Greek or Syriac language.\"13 Swedberg is equally convinced that, from the high heavens, the blessed continue to be interested in their kinsmen on earth. For the deceased have not lost their memory, \"but this recollection has be­ come purer, more refined, sharper.\" Therefore, they also have a \"holy feeling\" when their loved ones on earth repent from their sins.14 On the witness of \"second-sighted persons,\" Swedberg holds it quite cer­ tain that \"with God's permission, the shapes of the dead can appear to the living,\" and only \"the atheists and those abandoned by God\" are capable of denying \"the existence of ghosts.\"15 But, above all, he holds that man is in contact with heaven through the mediation of angels. They still move between heaven and earth like the angels on the lad­ der Jacob saw in his dream. The angels are \"servant spirits\" sent to watch over men on this low earth. Every human being has one or more such \"caring spirits\" who looks after him when the Evil One \"who roves like a roaring lion\" threatens to devour him. We shall see that these obliging spirits were later taken up by Sweden borg in his theosophy, even under the same name. Swedberg sees a manifest proof of this protection by the spirits in the fact that \"drunkards and other intemperates frequently conduct themselves as though, if they had ten lives, they could not even preserve one.\" In spite of this, they are protected from the gravest dangers because their angels are around them.16 7"

Already in his student years at Uppsala, he has been visited by one of these angels, who appears to him in his study-chamber and recommends that he read Scriver, Arndt, and other authorsP He also has other manifest proofs that the devil, who fears lest he become dangerous to his empire, has tried to destroy him. At the age of seven years, he narrowly escapes from being precipitated by the devil into a millrace; and, shortly before his appointment to the bishopric of Skara, God reveals to him in a dream that Satan will continue to persecute him in Vastergotland, and \"would cruelly pounce on me with the intention to murder me.\" Armed with a spear, Satan follows the carriage with bursts of sar­ donic laughter; finally, upon awakening, Swedberg sees his enemy \"clearly\" standing in the moonlight. It is only by constant prayer and the singing of hymns that he succeeds in driving away the demon. In reality, from the age of thirteen, Swedberg experiences prophetic dreams and apparitions, often of a marked hallucinatory nature, while fully awake. As he preaches in the pulpit, he hears on many oc­ casions-as do his listeners-choirs of angels singing hymns to the accompaniment of an invisible organ.l 8 Swedberg also evinced the same interest in the apparitions expe­ rienced by others as in his own. It appears that, little by little, the epis­ copal manse of Brunsbo became the center of all the superstition that still flourished in Sweden at that time. It was the rendezvous of the maidservants who were possessed or speaking with tongues; once any miraculous events were heard of in the diocese, the old bishop was called, who, by his prayers, the laying on of hands, or other similar means, exorcized the devil and healed those who had drawn upon themselves the punishment of God by some particularly grave sin. He says himself that even in England, Holland, and elsewhere abroad, his exorcisms were spoken of. It was especially told of him that he had succeeded, one day at Brunsbo, in expelling the devil who appeared to him in the guise of a cavalier through a small hole in a windowpane in the manse.

His religiosity is entirely unre­ flective and, despite its warmth, lacks that depth of feeling, that fac­ ulty of self-analysis that characterizes true mysticism. It never rises to the bliss of ecstasy any more than it founders in the torments of end­ less broodings. It is an innocent, old-time Swedish religiosity, healthy to the core, which, impelled by an infantile curiosity, seeks to open the door slightly to the super sensory world. This quality attaches itself also to the visions of Jesper Swed­ berg. While the visions of true mystics are generally confused and enigmatic, acquiring deep meaning only through symbolic interpre­ tation, those of Swedberg constitute concrete images, which only con­ firm his own notions, built on popular tradition, of the life hereafter. Take, for example, the first of the visions, which he says he has seen regarding heaven and hell at thirteen years of age. It is easy to see that it directly reproduces the old religious paintings found in churches and which stimulated his childish imagination. The Savior stands in person before a large basin filled with warm water, washing those he wants to save and introducing them immediately thereafter into the \"heavenly hall\" to the right where the elected sit, \"entirely naked in common felicity and joy in a holy ignorance of evil and a perfect in­ nocence.\" Swedberg then is led to the left and enters into hell where the condemned give themselves to rude, lascivious dances in a pit ex­ haling sulfurous vapors. \"And, despite their efforts to escape from the pit, I saw them pushed back into the abyss with blows of iron pitch­ forks amidst frightful wails and atrocious hissings.\"19 As we see, this is the traditional representation of hell found on altarpieces since the Middle Ages. It does not seem to me correct when Holmquist likens this conception of heaven and hell, in its smallest details, to the more characteristically, uniquely personal conception of Swedenborg, which are speculatively structured and entirely symbolic. 2o The theological conceptions of Swedberg are marked by the same straightforward simplicity. We have already had occasion to note the little importance he accords to dogma, placing above all else the concordance of life and doctrine.

Already, on the occasion of his journey abroad, he is deeply grieved to observe that, impelled by their conviction of the importance for salvation of good works, the French Catholics busy themselves with quantities of acts of charity to which Protestant countries remained quite indifferent. \"They, in their erroneous creed, innocently follow the teachings of Christ; we, in our doctrine of sovereign faith (stortro), which predomi­ nates in our country, practice no good works.\"22 This regrettable state of things appears still more clearly to Swedberg as his new episcopal functions permit him to know better the religious situation of his diocese, and more particularly among his clergy. Everywhere he observes that the teaching of Luther is misun­ derstood and that good deeds are considered to be superfluous pro­ vided one has the true faith. \"They all go to church regularly and the holy table is approached on the dates fixed, besides continuing to live in various sinful deeds of the flesh. No need to worry: the 'sovereign faith' will do it.\"23 A faith without good deeds, in Swedberg's opin­ ion, is not a living faith at all; it is \"a cerebral faith and not a faith of the heart, a shadow without a body, a dead faith and not a living one, indeed, a devilish faith, one I call the 'sovereign faith' in which Chris­ tianity takes refuge, and on which God may have mercy.\"24 It was especially the necessity, proclaimed by the Pietists, of a sincere repentance and a pious life that above all made him so sympa­ thetic towards them; and time after time he complains that no one can live piously, insist on keeping the Sabbath, and combat drunken­ ness without exposing oneself to the charge of Pietism by the clergy: \"You are a Pietist, you.\" He hopes for a new reformer who, preaching the unity of works and faith, will inspire Protestantism, congealed in a loveless orthodoxy, with a new life. \"0 my God, Thou who awak­ ened Luther and endowed him with the spirit of fearlessness, to in­ troduce anew the Christian doctrine of faith, send us also a Luther who, with the same spirit of fearlessness and the same blessed energy, may reestablish a Christian life! \"25 As we know, it was Emanuel 10"

We may conclude from the preceding that Swedberg did not, by his polemic against sovereign faith, consider himself in opposition to Luther. This is confirmed in his long study of the Protestant concep­ tion of faith in his Casa Pauperum, Gaza Divitum (House of the Poor, Treasure of the Wealthy; Iskara, 1723). In this work, Swedberg seeks to demonstrate, with the help of ample quotations from Luther, that the latter, when establishing his doctrine of justification by faith, de­ sired to create precisely that living faith proclaimed by Swedberg and his favorite Pietist authors; Luther ought not to be considered in any way as the inspirer of the \"sovereign faith\" that was dominant at the time. All things considered, Swedberg does not seem to be aware of deviating in the least from Luther's doctrine. There is, then, no rea­ son to see in Swedberg a direct representative of the heterodox doc­ trine that characterizes Sweden borg and which already appears in his very first work on a theological subject, De Fide et Bonis Operibus, published in 1738, and in which Luther's interpretation of the Pauline doctrine on justification by faith alone is specifically de­ nounced as a falsification of the biblical text. But it is clear that, all things considered, the tendencies of Swedberg head in the same di­ rection. It is equally possible that his middle-of-the-road position to some extent depends on his aversion to all dogmatic polemics. The preceding brief characterization unfortunately permits only a rather incomplete view of the spiritual atmosphere of the home in which Swedenborg was born and reared. A more detailed exposition would have required more extensive extracts from the works and the autobiography of Jesper Swedberg, more than space here allows. So I have to refer the reader interested in this matter to the very complete biography of Swedberg written by [Henry William] Tottie. The element that had the greatest influence on Emanuel Swedenborg's development was evidently his father's belief in a supersensory world that is capable of manifesting itself to us and directly intervening in our life. At that time, there were of course numerous Swedish homes where one could tell of wonderful dreams and visions and in which spirit apparitions and miraculous 11"

During Swedenborg's childhood, the ideas of the Enlightenment had not yet made their entry into Sweden, and many of the phenomena for which a scientific explana­ tion was found fifty years later still appeared to be unfathomable mysteries. But in the house of Jesper Swedberg, these miracles and these visions displayed a notably more important role than in most contemporary homes. These were not simply incidents that were dis­ cussed in idle moments and promptly forgotten in the course of daily occupations: they were real happenings, leaving their imprint on the life of the whole family. In this family circle, where all the children, except for one daughter who entered the world on Easter Monday, were born on a Sunday, every event, even the most insignificant, was considered to have a particular meaning; and an effort was made to discover the intervention of spirits in everything. The old bishop was surely not the only one to sense the presence of the devil everywhere, wandering through the manse like a \"roaring lion\" to devour him, or to believe that good angels of God constantly came to his rescue. From Swedberg's autobiography, it appears that the entire family shared his conception of life, according to which fires, accidents, sick­ ness, and poor harvests were regarded as so many chastisements of God, or as so many trials or afflictions. Happy occurrences, on the contrary, constituted recompense. Jesper Swedberg loved to compare his own destiny and that of his family to that ofJob and his house. To judge from the comparison that he himself made between the one and the other, it appears that his own existence was more full of bless­ ings than of hard trials. For the God who was adored in the home of Swedberg was not only the zealous guardian of good morals and the judge threatening the eternal punishments of hell, he was also the tender father above all, only resorting to the punishment of his children when so con­ strained and obliged, in the end always ready to forgive. In tracing God's protecting hand in everything, the Swedbergs had approached him so closely that he had been changed almost into a friendly house­ hold spirit, watching over the larder and the stables, never permitting anything in the house to go wrong as long as one did not disturb him intentionally. 12"

Moreover, this worship had an aesthetic quality that was certainly very rare in those days. Swedberg, like his son Emanuel after him, loved music above all. \"For God has endowed beautiful music with incredible force.\" And in his provident goodness, God had endowed Swedberg's house with an excellent musician. \"God has granted me the grace that Doctor Hesselius is a good violoncellist, and he plays beautiful and divine hymns every evening; which permits me to go to my rest with a peaceful and content spirit.\"26 How easy it is to imagine what such an evening in that paternal home must have been! The venerable bishop relates with his custom­ ary innocence how God has guided him throughout the phases of his life and how many manifest signs of God's grace and omnipotence he has seen. And the evening closes with the chant, to the accompani­ ment of Hesselius' violoncello, of one of the hymns, of such noble simplicity and beauty, that Jesper Swedberg has composed or trans­ lated; for example the \"Hymnus de Sanetis Angelis\" of Melanchthon, which so well reflects his religious views: Glory be to God for holy angels' watch that he by grace me vouchsafes against all evil powers.

The most complete ac­ count that we have of the religious events of his first years is to be found in a letter written to Gabriel Beyer, dated November 14, 1769: I want to tell you here how my early childhood was. From my fourth to my tenth year, my thoughts were constantly focused upon God, blessedness, and the passiones spirituales of mankind. I repeatedly revealed things that astonished my father and my mother and caused them to consider that angels spoke through me.

Like most great mystics, he has evidently unconsciously romanticized his recollections in the conviction of having been the elected instrument of God from the beginning. In particular, his statement that he did not know or accept the orthodox doctrine of atonement as a child seems less than credible. It would be difficult to explain why, in such a case, he was loyal to this doctrine preceding his theological period. On the other hand, everything suggests the accu­ racy of his recollections when he relates that, during his early child­ hood, he gave himself up to long meditations about \"God, blessedness, and the passiones spirituales of mankind,\" that he dis­ cussed these things with the clergy, and that his parents regarded him as a religious prodigy. That Swedenborg had been in mystical states already during his childhood years, foreshadowing his later visionary period, is a fact made clear by a declaration found in his Spiritual Diary §3464, pointed out by TafeL28 Referring to \"internal breathing,\" by means of which during his theosophical period Sweden borg believed himself able to enter into communication with the angels and spirits, he relates that he acquired the habit of this exercise while saying his morning and evening prayers during his childhood. If the descriptions of this \"in­ ternal respiration\" given later by Swedenborg, consisting of an inhi­ bition of external respiration, and allowing only imperceptible and silent respiratory exchange, are studied more closely, we realize that we here have a phenomenon that is known and described by a num­ ber of different mystics.

His emotions attain a fervor and his thoughts gain a clarity that he does not experience under normal con­ ditions. This suspension of respiration often constitutes the prelude to visions of a hallucinatory character. 29 The phenomenon appears to have been first produced with Sweden borg in an unconscious man­ ner, but he later learned, he tells us, to induce it by intense mental concentration. In this state, he believed he could suspend his external breathing for a whole hour and during this time could find himself in communion with angels and spirits. As can be seen, this respiratory inhibition constitutes a direct opening of the spiritual visions of Swedenborg, and we shall see later what an important role it has played in the evolution of his philosophy towards mysticism. The information we possess regarding Swedenborg's childhood, scanty though it be, nevertheless gives us an idea of the difference be­ tween his temperament and that of his father. From the first, we find in Swedenborg a speculative interest that was entirely lacking in Jes­ per Swedberg. Likewise, even in childhood, Swedenborg's religiosity assumes an ecstatic character of which no equivalent can be found in the father. From the very beginning, one has the impression of a more in­ troverted and complicated nature in Swedenborg, in which nothing remains of the basically healthy confidence of Jesper Swedberg. It is because of this that Swedenborg, unlike his father, cannot walk around in serene unconcern in a fairy tale land of wonder enchanted with miracles, rejoicing in each new apparition as a sign of divine power and goodness. His brain knows rest only when it has suc­ ceeded in finding an explanation for a phenomenon, in penetrating the causes of such occurrences. All the miracles he witnesses or that are related to him in his father's house do not merely turn his own imagination toward the supernatural; for him, from the beginning, they constitute so many problems demanding solution. In his search for answers, he addresses himself first to the sciences that seem to him the most exact in their methods and results. He demands of mathe­ matics and mechanics the explanation of the creation and subsistence of the universe, then searches anatomy for the definitive solution of the mysteries of the soul.

Like most mystics, Swedenborg took his defini­ tive turn toward mysticism as a result of a personal crisis. But he was committed to the road leading to it well before this crisis. In fact, even at the time when he was professing a philosophy so distinctly mechanistic that it attracted a certain amount of attention abroad, we detect in Swedenborg's mind a leaven of mysticism de­ rived from his paternal inheritance. It is a feeling of the existence of a higher world, to which our own world has a relationship. It is in vain that he asserts on many occasions that such a world is beyond our knowledge, which is reduced to the limits of our sensory perceptions. In spite of everything, he is pursued by the desire to learn something of life beyond the grave and of the secret influence of higher powers upon our earthly life. In his dreams and in his visions, the supersen­ sory world meets him in perceptible forms; finally, he believes he has found the key to the spiritual world in the doctrine of correspon­ dences. It is then that he commits himself to the gigantic task of ex­ plaining, in terms of natural science, not only the visible universe but also the unknown world on high. Starting with the human anatomy, his Animal Kingdom attempts an empirical penetration, not merely of the essence of the soul and its intercourse with the body, but even the state of the soul after physical death. But this work never reaches its appointed goal; while it is in progress, Sweden borg receives a divine apparition commanding him to renounce the natural sciences and confine himself exclusively to work in spiritualibus. Thus it is that the mystical tendencies he has for so long tried to restrain by scientific criticism finally win. His patrimony claims its rights. It is significant that, during that decisive crisis, which we know about from his Journal of Dreams, Swedenborg repeatedly sees in the dreams his paternal home on the Great Square in U ppsala and hears the admonitory voice of his father. His reflective spirit will never allow him to attain the happy state of naive faith possessed by Jesper Swedberg, and he often speaks with envy of the poor in spirit \"who believe and do not see.\" Nevertheless, it appears that something of the childish trust of his father casts its glow on his closing years.

He even tells his visitors that his physical health improves from day to day and that he is growing new teeth to replace those he had lost. It seemed too that Swedenborg had a certain physical resem­ blance to his father, of which the portraits that we possess of each of them give no idea. Carl GustafTessin, who once \"from pure curiosity to make the acquaintance of a strange personality,\" paid Sweden borg a visit, found his \"countenance perfectly like that of the late Bishop Swedberg; but shorter in stature, with weak eyes, a large mouth, pale complexion, friendly, cheerful, and talkative.\"30 In his stuttering speech, Swedenborg talked to Tessin regarding human destiny after death and the various heavens and hells. He told his visitor that \"whenever he is alone he is visited by angels and by the deceased.\" These are the \"guardian spirits\" of his father, who have never left him and who serve as intermediaries with the spiritual world. De­ spite all the divergences, Swedenborg's philosophy returns to the same point as the innocent superstition of his father: a sense of never­ ceasing union with the transcendental and divine.

In addition, he felt himself per­ sonally to be under the constant \"guardianship of the holy angels.\" After his father's appointment to the bishopric of Skara, Swedenborg went to live with his brother-in-law, Erik Benzelius, in order to pursue university studies under his supervision. To judge from the correspondence between them, Erik Benzelius appears to have been the relative closest to Sweden borg during the next decades; and it is natural to suppose that this brother-in-law, thirteen years older than he, exercised considerable influence over Swedenborg, 18"

Erik Benzelius is one of the most magnificent representatives of the second flowering of the humanism that arose in Sweden during the last decades of her political grandeur. While the multiplication of scientific material and the broadening of horizons had already forced a specialization in the field of science in other countries, Sweden, where the Renaissance had only tardily penetrated and taken root, still possessed a phalanx of late-born humanists for whom specializa­ tion did not exist and whose interest and zeal embraced every area of contemporary science. With the greater number of them, this desire for universal scientific conquest (which Schlick rightly compares to the great-power policy pursued by Sweden) demanded a disastrous dispersion of energy that resulted, in many cases, in an accomplish­ ment that did not match up to their genius. The contemporary field of science had become too vast to be grasped in its totality by a single scholar, however energetic. Moreover, the cultural isolation of Swe­ den, as well as its limited means, constituted additional obstacles that were difficult to overcome. So it is that, among the great Swedish scholars at the close of the seventeenth century, some, like Rudbeck, established magnificent systems, although fantastic and devoid of any critical spirit, while others became scholarly compilers, as well-known abroad as in their own country, inspirers of various movements but themselves incapable of concentrating upon a homo­ geneous lifework. Erik Benzelius belonged in this second category. His own schol­ arship included ancient manuscripts, comparative philology, Nordic archaeology, and history, both ecclesiastical and literary-in other words, all the humanistic sciences that were pursued at this time. He was also keenly interested in the many new branches of natural sci­ ence and their practical application. The scientific thrust of the Swedish \"Era of Liberty\" (1718-1772) owes much to him for the cre­ ative impulses that he stimulated, and notably for the foundation of the first Swedish scientific society, the Collegium curiosorum, and the two that succeeded it-the Bokvettsgillet and Vetenskapssocieteten-as 19"

The active role Benzelius played in the practical organization of scientific studies at the University ofUppsala should not be forgotten. Either directly or through the mediation of friends, or friends of friends, he was in contact with all scholarly Europe, and it was due to his initiative that a goodly number of young students with promising futures found the means to perfect their education abroad. Neverthe­ less, his personal scholarly production never attained the level worthy of the central position he had enjoyed in Sweden and in the scientific life of his age. His historical researches largely remained in the form of lecture notes, and the two great works that he had projected­ editions of Philo Judaeus and Ulfilas-were not published in his life­ time. The first of these two works was anticipated by an English edi­ tion, and the second was only published seven years after Benzelius' death, but was already antiquated. By that time, two young authors, Sotberg and Ihre, equipped with a more modern education in philol­ ogy, had produced a text and translation of Ulfilas. 31 Despite this, Swedenborg found in his brother-in-law the surest scientific guide and best-qualified supervisor in the scientific circles of the time. From his relations with Benzelius, he also absorbed some of the universal scientific enthusiasm. In fact, we find in Swedenborg's letters to his brother-in-law a reflection of this enthusiasm for every new discovery and problem of the human spirit. In the first letter he writes to Benzelius from London, Sweden borg tells him about his visit to the tomb of the celebrated humanist Isaac Casaubon in West­ minster Abbey. He \"was seized,\" he says, \"with such great love of this hero of learning\" that he kissed the tomb and immediately composed some Latin verses in honor of Casaubon.3 2 Through Benzelius, then, Sweden borg is directly connected to the generation of scholars active towards the end of Sweden's age of grandeur. Actually, the scientific impulses Swedenborg received dur­ ing his years of study in Rudbeck's Uppsala appear to me to deserve the same attention as those he found later in the England of Newton.

These are not only the biblical accounts of the earthly paradise, the Flood, the ages of the antediluvians, and so on, which his geological theories are drawn upon to corroborate, but even all the cosmogonic conceptions of mythology and of the poetry of classical antiquity. His cosmological system permits him to confirm the descriptions by Hesiod and his successors; of the \"world egg\" from which the sun and planets emerged; of Plato's conceptions of a subsolar world and his myth of Atlantis; of the recitations of Ovid on the four ages of the earth. Homer himself, that \"sire of all poets,\" seems to have given voice to a profound truth when he tells us that \"Pallas, Venus, and all the other gods of lust have lived on this earth and associated with men.\" In ef­ fect, Swedenborg understands by this that \"the earth was formerly like heaven and the age like a celestial amusement.\"36 Swedenborg, then, like Rudbeck, considers all tradition, whether from the Bible or from ancient mythology, to be the allegor­ ical, if not literal, expression of historical truth. Like Rudbeck, he tries to discover in every ancient legend and in all ancient history the same historical events mentioned in the Bible, even though they may at times appear in somewhat different form. As we shall see later, this notion will follow him into his theosophical period during which he creates, by a kind of amalgam of Genesis with the accounts of Hesiod and the four ages of Ovid, a strange fable of the evolution of the human race from its childhood. Another trait in Swedenborg that is reminiscent of Rudbeck is his incredible power of combination. Without entering into Rud­ beck's favorite domain-etymological explanation-he displays the same boldness as the latter in skillfully regrouping facts for his own purposes, especially when it comes to discovering the allegorical im­ plications in the accounts of ancient writers or of the Bible. In this re­ spect, his scientific works already foreshadow his biblical exegesis. But Sweden borg especially resembles Rudbeck in the scope of the tasks that he sets for himself from the beginning.

The exam­ ple that Holmquist cites regarding this state of mind, the passage in a letter to Benzelius in which Swedenborg speaks of the superstition of the Catholic Church historian Vastovius is, despite his prudence, rather characteristic,38 Even more eloquent in this respect is perhaps the allusion found in a letter addressed to Benzelius (Opera I, §217) from the year 1712 where Swedenborg, indignant because his father has left him without money, remarks that \"it is difficult to live like the maid in Schone, without either food or drink.\" The reference is to a maid, Ester Jonadotter of Norre-Aby, who lived without nour­ ishment during six years. This was one of the great miracles that Jes­ per Swedberg himself had witnessed and that he had related in detail in his sermons \"in order that neither we nor our descendants should never forget such a miracle of God.\"39 The old bishop would no doubt have taken deeply to his heart the irreverent tone of his son when mentioning the incident. In general, in the letters from his trip and the years following, Swedenborg appears more like a man of the world. He is completely absorbed by his scientific theories and by the expectation of celebrity 25"

The best example of this can be found in the proposition he submits to Ben­ zelius to reduce the salaries of the professors in order to provide a po­ sition for him at U ppsala. When this is rejected by Benzelius, he suggests suppressing a chair of theology or medicine. He expresses himself in rather disdainful terms regarding Swedish scholars and their Cartesian \"prejudices.\" And it is precisely this scientific ambi­ tion that, at the time of his religious crisis, he will consider the great­ est and most difficult to eradicate of his sins. His relations with his family seem, at least at times, rather cold. His father appears to enter­ tain some doubts about his scientific future or at least about the possi­ bility of his carving out an assured future for himself in this line; it is only with difficulty that he is induced to provide his son with the means needed for his studies. This exclusive orientation toward pure science and this newly acquired self-confidence are easily explained by Swedenborg's con­ viction that he is standing at the springs of modern science. It could be anticipated that this atmosphere would forever stifle all tendency toward mysticism in him. The survival of these tendencies, observ­ able to a certain extent in the philosophical works appearing in the decades after his voyage to England, suggests the question whether, even in the environment of sober empiricism he experienced during his sojourn in England, there were not some factors acting in the op­ posite direction. We are unable to analyze here in all its facets an age customarily seen too much in the light of the succeeding period, that of the French Enlightenment. We shall only try to deal with certain factors whose role had a certain importance, especially for Swedenborg. Without any doubt, the time of Newton is above all the golden age of the empirical methods and the experiment. The natural sci­ ences now acquire a cultural hegemony that they have never known. If, prior to this period, theology and philosophy had alternately, by turns, proclaimed themselves to be the science of sciences, it is now the natural sciences that lend the support of their arguments to theo­ logical and philosophical verities and that impose their methods on these disciplines.

No account was taken of diametrically opposed ten­ dencies that animated most of the guiding spirits of the age-which explains why, at the very hour the ideas of the Enlightenment in the form of the Encyclopedia win a definitive victory, all over cultured Europe those forces that were to cause their downfall were already in action and, in fact, proselytizing. The era of Newton was a time of crisis, and, like all similar pe­ riods, it was animated by a contradictory spirit that is difficult to pen­ etrate. When the chains imposed on human thought by orthodoxy and philosophic rationalism were struck off, the free practice of sci­ entific studies was not the only impulse to be awakened. Mysticism also acquired a freedom of action that allowed it influence on public opinion. Not only did it flourish within sects that, in England as everywhere else, now had their heyday, but it took over the new sci­ ence, seeking in scientific discoveries the justification of its own dreams. Here we find historical authentication, frequently confirmed, of the fact that the occasions when experimental sciences succeed in opening new horizons for the human spirit are often also the times when superstition and mysticism enlarge their domain and recruit new followers. This is not only the result of the fact that the empiri­ cal sciences are in their beginnings related to magic, that historically chemistry is the daughter of alchemy. It is also because scientific ex­ periments generate new results without being able to explain them satisfactorily; thus, they entice impatient minds to supernatural inter­ pretations.

Naturally, the temptation was even stronger at the beginning of the eighteenth century. The new science was born of the philosophy of nature of the preceding century, a philosophy with strong elements of occultism and Kabbalah. Long after it abandoned the methods of past times in order to devote itself exclusively to experimentation, it continued to exhibit a taste for occult speculations. It is thus, for ex­ ample, that Thomasius, one of the greatest German pioneers of the Enlightenment, was the disciple of Robert Fludd and published books with the clear imprint of occultism. Robert Boyle, one of the founders of modern chemistry and one of the teachers of Sweden­ borg, was deeply interested in alchemy as well as in all sorts of mysti­ cal speculations. It was the same in Sweden. Urban Hiarne, because of his scien­ tific work, can be considered as one of the great pioneers of the En­ lightenment; moreover, he contributed in large measure to a more modern outlook by his agitation against the trials for witchcraft. Yet he was also a lover of alchemy and astrology and published an ardent defense of Paracelsus. Polhem, with whom Swedenborg directly col­ laborated, was not at all, as we shall see, a stranger to mystical con­ cepts or the interest in occultism. And this scenario repeats itself in all countries. The great rationalistic system of the seventeenth century had drawn a very clear demarcation between the domains of faith and of science, and step by step people became lulled by the illusion that these two would henceforth not disturb each other. The great discov­ eries that marked the turn of the century threatened to demolish these hopes. The traditional proofs of religious truths became useless, and the theologians who had hardly had time to reconcile Christian­ ity and Cartesianism suddenly found themselves faced by new scien­ tific facts whose consequences appeared to lead to materialism and atheism. The theologians were not alone in dreading such a use of the new discoveries.

Each sought to prove that, far from undermining belief in God and the immortal­ ity of the soul, the new doctrine furnished new and powerful argu­ ments on behalf of these ideas. It is in England, where this spirit ruled among the majority of scientific personalities, that this form of apologetics found the largest number of propagators. It is for this rea­ son that Robert Boyle founded in London a special institute for pub­ lic conferences where various orators might demonstrate that the new science, far from being opposed to the cardinal truths of faith, had a necessary connection with them.40 It was particularly impor­ tant to prove that the new ideas on the origin of the world responded point by point to the creation story in Genesis. In the earliest cosmo­ logical works of Swedenborg are found similar attempts to establish the validity of the Mosaic cosmology from the perspective of natural science. The seven days of creation, the earthly paradise, the Flood, the origin of the rainbow, all the details of the biblical tradition, found entirely satisfactory confirmation in the new naturalistic con­ ception. The burden was \"to approve nothing unacceptable to the word of God and to irrefutable reason.\" It is in connection with this strange current of the time, in which an anxious eye was kept on the past lest contact with authority and tradition be lost, that we must also see the philosopher who, for his contemporaries as for posterity, most clearly summed up the world of ideas of the empirical sciences and with Newton stood as the intellectual master of the century: John Locke. We have all the more reason to dwell a moment upon this illustrious philosopher in that his Essay Concerning Human Understanding played a decisive role in Swedenborg's development and even extended an influence far into his theosophical period.

It is above all thanks to the very complete study by Hertling,41 from which I have drawn the major part of the following account, that the amalgam of empirical and rationalistic reasonings that char­ acterize Locke's philosophy have been brought out, and that, for this reason, the true purpose pursued by the author of the Essay has ap­ peared to us under a new light. Far from constituting-as contempo­ raries including Voltaire believed-a lethal blow against all metaphysics, far from seeking to create doubts about the existence of God, the immortality of the soul, and the validity of moral law, the Essay was written with the apparent aim of arming religion and morality against the consequences of the naturalistic philosophy that threatened to overthrow them.42 In reality, the extensive study of empirical knowledge, which occupies the larger part of the work, leads to the Platonic idea that no true knowledge of the physicosensory world, which is in the process of constant modification, can exist. We can only gain real knowledge by means of general concepts, which exist solely in the domain of ideas.43 Along with sensation and reflection, which, while collecting and extrapolating the elements of our conception of things, provide us with a relative knowledge of phenomena within and outside our­ selves, there exists an intuitive and demonstrative knowledge that permits us to affirm with ample evidence the concordance of two ideas, and teaches us to recognize necessary truths. It follows that true knowledge is not rooted in experience; it is independent of expe­ rience and surpasses it. Knowledge assumes the form of necessary and general judgments by which we affirm the objective relations be­ tween ideas we have perceived. 44 Not only does the universality of geometric propositions depend on this knowledge, but also all the verities that we necessarily must acknowledge, such as our own exis­ tence, the existence of God, of life after death, etc. No doubt these \"eternal verities\" are not inborn, but every human being possessing ordinary human faculties finds himself obliged to recognize them once he directs his thoughts to the examination of his own ideas.45 From an epistemological standpoint, one may realize, as Hertling has pointed out,46 that to read into Locke's work any attempt to establish, in agreement with Kant, the impossibility of 30"

On the contrary, Locke ac­ knowledges the highest degree of evidence for the knowledge of the existence of God, and in the Essay, one can find numerous forms of metaphysical reasoning. Locke believes that we are able, with the same degree of plausibility as that accepted for the establishment of scientific theories, to accept the existence of angels who surpass us by various degrees of perfection and who lead us, through gradations analogous to those we observe in nature, toward the infinite perfec­ tion of the Creator. At many points in his work, he speculates on the nature of these angels and their faculty of assuming corporeal form, a faculty that he is disposed to accept on the authority of the Church Fathers. He maintains that our conceptions of a spiritual substance are at least as clear as those of a material substance and speaks clearly of the existence of a \"world of the intellect\" that is \"certainly more ex­ tensive and beautiful than the material world.\"47 In the mind of Locke, therefore, there exists not only a clearly rationalistic conception coexistent with his empiricism, but also a cer­ tain element of mysticism that is obviously akin to Neoplatonic phi­ losophy, including his conception of intuition as a sort of spiritual sight, a kind of inner light that imposes itself irresistibly upon our eyes from the moment they focus upon it. One can say as much re­ garding his idea of two worlds as well as his belief in spirits and their faculty of materialization. Today there is almost general agreement in seeking the origin of this mystical element in the relationship between Locke and the philosophical school that, at this time in England, was the clearest ex­ pression of the opposition to the materialism of Hobbes as well as to the rationalism of Descartes, who despised mysticism. Here we refer to the group of Platonic thinkers known as the Cambridge School, of which Ralph Cudworth and Henry More were the principal repre­ sentatives. All were theologians and Puritans, and their thinking al­ ways retained a trace of these elements. Against the mechanical philosophy of nature, they raised a conception of nature that was heavily impregnated with theology, and they borrowed the principal elements of this view from Neoplatonism and the Christian Plato­ nism of the Church Fathers. But they were also in close touch with the mystical philosophy of the Renaissance and the following 31"

Most of them were pure mystics by temperament, for whom apparitions and ghosts were an absolute, complete reality, and who were given to magic and to a Kabbalistic exegesis of the Bible. They maintained continuous per­ sonal relations with several leaders of modern science, whom they re­ garded as allies in the struggle against atheists and materialists. They exercised a considerable influence not only on Locke but also on Newton and Boyle. We shall see further on how much in common the Cambridge theologians have with the system in which the mystic philosophy of Swedenborg appears for the first time in manifest form, a system that is found in the Economy of the Animal Kingdom and works of the same period. Up to a certain point, this kinship certainly depends on the fact that both the Cambridge School and Swedenborg have drawn from the same sources-Neoplatonism and the Church Fa­ thers, themselves influenced by Neoplatonism-and on the whole proceed from related currents of thought. Swedenborg no doubt knew of the Cambridge School and was influenced by it. As we shall see further on, his work confirms that he knew, at least at second hand, of the philosophy of Cudworth and More. Subjected to the alternating influence of contemporary science and a philosophy colored by theology, the Essay Concerning Human Understanding became a work that, despite a logical reconciliation of pure form, reflects the irreducible antagonism of contemporary doc­ trines. Thus in the second book of the Essay, one reads that \"in [expe­ rience] all our knowledge is founded and from that it ultimately derives itself.\" But the author declares, in book four, that \"on ... in­ tuition ... depends all certainty and evidence of all our knowl­ edge.\"48 Toward the end of his study, Hertling rightly points out that the empirical tendencies of Locke's philosophy are those that were es­ pecially active at the time following. But he goes perhaps too far in thinking the rationalistic tendencies ()f Locke passed by the contem­ porary world entirely unperceived. Without being comparable to the former, from a historical viewpoint, the rationalistic tendency has certainly been for many minds, by the very fact that it was mingled with the empirical tendencies, the starting point of a philosophy en­ tirely opposed to the sensationalistic doctrine of the Enlightenment 32"

In this, it contributed to the mystic and idealistic reaction that did not delay in coming to the surface. It is at least in this sense that the rationalism of Locke has acted on Sweden borg. His philosophy, born of a basically empirical outlook, found precisely in Locke's thesis of intuition the fulcrum of support that permitted him to evolve toward a pronounced mysti­ cism without abandoning his earlier theories. One of the most characteristic of the Swedish representatives of this schism between the old and new that I have tried to sketch was Christopher Polhem, Sweden borg's leading scientific mentor. By temperament a protagonist of empiricism and applied mechanics, Polhem still remained, in many aspects of his philosophical convic­ tions, an adherent of metaphysics and the traditional philosophy of nature. On his return from England, Swedenborg became associated with him in a scientific relationship as his amanuensis; Swedenborg often helped Polhem to record his scientific ideas. Consequently, it has been very difficult to establish the true parenthood of a few of Sweden borg's early papers, since they are also found among Polhem's own papers and in the latter's handwriting. Under these circum­ stances, it is hard to define in a more precise manner Polhem's influ­ ence over Sweden borg. Bring49 and Stroh50 both point out that this influence must have been considerable. It is, then, of great impor­ tance to study Polhem's philosophy of nature more closely. Having only in a few cases had the opportunity to study Polhem's unedited and difficult-to-decipher manuscripts, I am obliged to have recourse to extracts furnished by Bring. Whenever Sweden borg found the occasion during his theosoph­ ical period to characterize Polhem, with whom he seems to have bro­ ken off in 1719 for personal reasons, he always depicted him as a cunning, out-and-out atheist: Pol hem had confirmed himself in the belief that God does not exist, that all is natural and mechanical, and that men and animals are mere inflated mechanisms. He is also por­ trayed as given to magic. As punishment for the lack of faith mani­ fested in this world he is, in the spiritual world, condemned to the fabrication of mechanical birds, cats, etc.51 This description of 33"

From excerpts of the cor­ respondence between Polhem and Benzelius that are quoted in Bring, it is quite clear that, in Polhem's opinion, one should not ques­ tion the text of the Bible. \"It is not Christian,\" he says, \"to doubt the words of Moses, dictated by the Holy Spirit, and even less the words of Christ.\" He was equally convinced \"that between the word of Moses and the properties of nature no contradiction exists provided one accepts certain rules dictated by reason, without which man is like an animal without a soul\"52 Nonetheless, he pushes the interven­ tion of reason rather far when he tries, for example, to disengage himself from the story of Creation by maintaining that the Mosaic version is only applicable \"to the origin of his people and had taken a very limited region of the world for its entirety.\" The cosmological theories of Polhem appear to rest essentially on a Cartesian basis. It may be true, he declares, that parts of Descartes' thesis are subject to revision, but certain others appear to him as \"proven.\" \"For,\" he says, \"one observes the rather strange fact that all the properties of nature are founded on mathematical and mechanical principles.\"53 This same mechanistic viewpoint is found in the earlier scientific works of Swedenborg. However, Pol hem min­ gles with those physical theories of Descartes, which he retained, a certain number of other conceptions that appear partly to be echoes of older systems of the philosophy of nature, partly derived from newer scientific theories and partly the fruit of his own hardly me­ thodical speculations. Thus, he differs from the Cartesian theory of the elements and states that all particles of matter take the form of spheres. Here he appeals, as he often does, to the testimony of the senses. \"All bodies perceptible to the senses, as well as matter itself, attest that the spherical form is the most favorable to motion, as is the property of fluid matter.\" Consequently, the space between particles of matter should consist of a \"pure vacuum,\" and this void should be \"almost as extensive as matter, in the bosom of which one can affirm that the divine is omnipresent.\" This void is, in effect, the area of \"a perpetual motion outside of matter, motion that can only be God himself, who constitutes its essence.\"54 In another passage, Polhem speaks \"of the four infinites of time and space, the center and the concept of which is God himself.\"55 This 34"

It is also found among certain mystic naturalists, hostile to the rationalism of Descartes, Leibniz, and Wolff, who appear to them to place God out­ side the world and thereby render his existence highly doubtful. These philosophers identify God with the absolute \"universal\" space that surrounds matter and occupies the interstices between the most minute particles of this matter and even, for certain ones among them, the internal space of matter. This, in their mind, is the only way to elude the hypothesis of an infinite matter and at the same time to es­ tablish the omnipresence of God. They invoke the words of the Gospel: \"Through Him we live and move and have our being.\" This is notably the point of view of the German philosopher Andreas Rudiger, who, as we shall see, certainly influenced Swedenborg. 56 It is difficult to decide whether Pol hem was also influenced by Rudiger or whether he has been inspired by a more ancient philosophy. This view of matter does not appear, however, to have been a systematically de­ veloped concept for Polhem; for, in another exposition. he tries in ef­ fect to reconcile the biblical doctrine of creation from nothing with the hypothesis of a medium \"more subtle than air ... that our gross senses are unable to perceive,\" and that consequently appears to us to be nothingness. God has made finite matter out of this infinite matter. 57 This subtle matter, which Pol hem at times identifies with God and at times considers as coeternal with God, will also serve him in explaining all spiritual functions. In his \"Thoughts on the Existence of Spirits,\" the manuscript of which is in the Royal Library in Stock­ holm, he speaks scornfully of the \"learned men,\" who \"have taken upon themselves to writing about immaterial things, such as the soul, thoughts, angels, and God Himself.\" That, in his opinion, is a vain at­ tempt, man being incapable of \"conceiving anything beyond matter.\" But now experience proves that our thoughts \"have the same activity as our senses; in other words, that they depend on the nourishment of the body, that they are susceptible to work and fatigue, whence it can be concluded that they must possess a material quality, all motion being a function of matter, however rarified it may be.\" And granted that \"formal matter\" acts upon our senses, that the air with its tremu­ lations impinges upon our eardrums and the undulations of the ether 35"

Just as sound can pass through a wall and sight through the \"hardest diamond,\" so, he be­ lieves, nothing can resist the vibrations of thought. This explains the mutual awareness that two intimate friends-or children and parents or a husband and wife---can create over a distance of several miles. If one of these suffers a trauma, mortal anguish, or great joy, and at the same time concentrates his thought on the absent one, a certain com­ munication of these feelings will often, if not always, be produced. If one of the two perceives in a dream the misfortune or prosperity of the other, it is nothing but \"the motion of thought substance between them.\" In the same vein, Pol hem explained the apparitions of ghosts and phantoms. This concept of wonderfully subtle matter, occupying the entire universe and carrying the thought of one individual to another to any distance, is found among numerous occult authors of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, including Cornelius Agrippa von Nettesheim and Paracelsus. It is one of the ideas that led to Mesmer's discovery of animal magnetism. We see, then, how Polhem, through his constant efforts in the natural sciences to apply the laws of me­ chanics and through his reluctance to \"comprehend\" anything what­ soever \"outside matter, its figure and motion,\" approaches unconsciously the mystical form of the philosophy of nature. His naive materialism, which identifies divinity with infinite space and spirit with matter, leaves the field open to theosophical conclusions. We have just seen from his hypothesis of \"thought substance\" that he has now acquired the means of proving scientifically the reality of telepathy and ghosts. His point of departure is exactly the reasoning by which spiritism has tried over the last centuries under various names to explain scientifically spirit appearances. It has not been possible for me to establish up to what point Pol hem advanced his theorizing in this respect.

In the earliest works of Swedenborg-even in those of which his authorship is beyond all question-we find repeated echoes of Polhem's outlook. It is thus that Swedenborg earnestly adopts his master's hypothesis of the spherical form of the basic particles of which matter is composed, and he seeks with even more eagerness to establish that all organic life, including our mental activities, is really only a series of motions subject to the same laws as the phenomena perceptible to our sens~s. Such is the leading idea that inspires two of his first physiological works, \"Proofs Showing That Our Vital Essence Consists Mostly of Minute Vibrations; that is to say, 'Tremu­ lations,\" published in Daedalus Hyperboreus in 1718, and a 1719 man­ uscript on \"The Anatomy of Our Most Subtle Nature, Showing That Our Motive and Vital Essence Consists of Tremulations.\"58 The me­ chanical explanation that he gives here of the vital functions of human beings had been set forth previously by the Italian Borelli in his work De motu animalium, to which Pol hem also had recourse 59 and which had been used by Descartes and Baglivi. Swedenborg refers to these predecessors but believed he had \"confirmed and de­ veloped\" their theory in a more complete manner. \"For I consider my proofs as new and my own and the idea itself to be another's\" (Opera, I, §297). What is noteworthy is that Sweden borg does not remain con­ tent, as his predecessors did, to apply the mechanistic theory of trem­ ulations to the circulation of the blood and the nervous system, but that he extends it, like Polhem, to practically the whole of humanity's spiritual life. He cites the same examples of telepathy and thought transmission as Polhem and believes himself warranted in conclud­ ing that the thoughts of the nonreasoning animals are no more than tremulations produced by external sensations. He does not pro­ nounce directly in these works on the nature and activity of human reason, but it is evident that he considers them to be of a similar order.

Sweden borg, on the con­ trary, opined, in Opera V, §294, that the sun, the center of our solar system, was the residence of the blessed, for the good reason that The subtlest of all atmospheres, and the finest essence wherein is the minutest element, are in the sun, for the nearer to the sun, the finer; and in its center is presumably such fineness that the particles are almost devoid of composition and put off the de­ nomination of matter and also of form, weight, and many other properties possessed by compound particles. And it would also seem likely that in their finest, must be the finest of beings. A god, an angel, a thing which moreover has nothing of matter in its being, must be especially in its own element; like seeks like, and the finer does not naturally seek the grosser; so it could rather be believed (although I readily leave this to my brother's judgment) that God has this seat in the sun, as the Bible says.60 It is easy to see where Swedenborg got the idea for this theory. Descartes, as we know, postulated as a first and most subtle element, the most tenuous of elements, solar matter, matter aflame, the finest and most active in the cosmos, which formed the sun and fixed stars and fills the intercorpuscular space between all other elements. In his Prodromus Principiorum of 1721, Swedenborg holds that the spaces between particles are occupied by this fiery matter. He proposes that this matter is refined to the point of no longer warranting the name \"matter\" and that it should be postulated as the abode of God, the an­ gels, and all things whose essence contain nothing of matter. There is no difficulty in tracing the relationship between Swedenborg's early ideas in natural philosophy and those of Polhem. With the aim of rigorously applying the laws of mechanics, both as­ sume that the spiritual is only a higher exponent of the material, that thought is only a refined form of action. But it is clearly evident that this identification of spirit and matter opens the door to a theosophi­ cal conception of the universe.

In his cosmology, based on the vortical theory of Descartes, he consequently starts with the mathematical point as the principle underlying all natural particles, arguing that nature is obedient to the same laws as geometry, with nothing nongeometrical existing in na­ ture and vice versa.61 This indivisible unit devoid of spatial extension is found midway between the infinite, out of which it is created, and the finite world, of which it is the source. \"It is comparable to the two-faced Janus, seeing in opposite directions simultaneously, each of his two faces turned toward one of the two universes\" (Prodromus §31). The point is created by motion from the infinite. This motion naturally must be pure motion, which is not subject to mechanical laws. Furthermore, the point embraces nothing substantial or suscep­ tible of being put in motion, so its motion becomes an interior state, a tendency (conatus) toward motion. Possessing only a single limit and not, therefore, enclosing any space, it cannot be considered as spatial in terms of finite objects. But if one compares it to pure motion, from which it emanates, one is forced to recognize it in a moment of anal­ ogy as possessing some spatial aspect (intellectum spatium). The fact that Sweden borg assigns to the \"natural\" point an in­ termediate position between the finite and the infinite depends upon the fact that he considers everything that is finite as subject to the laws of mechanics. For him, as for Polhem, the concepts of the finite and matter coincide. The point, having no spatial extension, cannot be considered as finite. Being derived directly from the infinite, it preserves something of the spirit of the infinite. It is not within the purview of this study to indicate how, start­ ing with the natural point, Swedenborg structured his very compli­ cated cosmology. I can more appropriately pass over this question since we already have rather good summaries of the system put forth 39"

Thereupon, the points existing everywhere are those that, by their motion, give rise to aggregates that are progressively more and more complex. In the first particle thus created, primum finitum, the \"first finite\" or primum substantiale, the first purely spatial particle, we dis­ cern two tendencies, produced by the motion of points within the particles: one tending toward equilibrium and the other in the oppo­ site direction. The result of these two tendencies is that the more complex elementary particles enclose, along with passive substances, active substances representing motion. What characterizes the whole system is that Sweden borg, who accepts the theory of attraction but rejects the Newtonian doctrine of the void and the action at a distance, structures the entire universe down to its most minute particle by analogy with the planetary world. His prima finita are already terrestrial globes in miniature, moving spirally and turning around their own axes. Every evolution and every differentiation are entirely a function of motion. The entire universe, whose birth we are thus shown, is subject to mechanical laws. \"Ipse mundus tam elementaris quam mineralis et vegetalis, pariter anatomico animalis pure mechanicus est\", Prodromus §9). The mechanical forces that determine the movement of planets in their orbits are identical to those that, through the nervous system, fibers, and muscles, set the different parts of the body of human and animal into motion. The heart functions as a pump, the lungs as bel­ lows, and all our sensory perceptions can likewise be explained in mechanical terms. In his Prodromus Philosophiae Ratiocinantis de Infi­ nitio, published the same year, Swedenborg extends the laws of me­ chanics to the soul itself. Every created thing known to us is subject to the laws of geometry and mechanics, so we must necessarily con­ clude, by way of analogy, that the situation is the same with the soul. Although the imperfection of our investigative resources has not per­ mitted us to discover the soul's mechanism, there is no reason to con­ clude that we shall never succeed someday (Prodromus §197). Swedenborg even goes so far as to call the soul a machine and only emphasizes that it should not be viewed as an inanimate machine, but as a machina animata (Prodromus §190). 40"

Its seat is in the whole of the body, but is primarily localized in the finest of its tissues, notably in the brain and the spinal chord (Prodromus §2S6ff.). Since the soul constitutes the most subtle substance of the body, we know for sure that it is immortal, for it could never be destroyed by any grosser ele­ ments. It escapes decomposition and cannot perish by air or in any other way. At the moment of physical death, it frees itself from the organic tissues and is concentrated into a whole, even if a few scat­ tered parts of it perish (Scientific and Philosophical Treatises, 31-32). The functions of the soul consist of movements that are produced in the tissues of the brain and the subtle fluid they contain. As one can see, Sweden borg here still holds to the conception re­ garding the soul and its functions that we found earlier in the work on \"tremors,\" a concept whose origin we have been able to trace to Polhem. But this concept is here accompanied by an argument that well proves that Swedenborg, far from wishing to undermine faith in God and the immortality of the soul, tries, on the contrary, to strengthen that faith by his theory. He says that by proclaiming the soul to be spiritual, the philosophers have succeeded neither in ex­ plaining its relationship with the body-the Cartesian hypothesis on the intermediate role of the \"animal spirits\" being in his eyes no more than provisional-nor in understanding its existence in the midst of a finite universe. The philosophers' mysterious descriptions and scholastic distinctions lead many readers to doubt-if not openly, at least in their hearts-the very existence of the soul and to believe that nothing distinguishes us from the animals (Prodromus §198ff). An­ other of Swedenborg's works from the same period says that to pos­ tulate the unknowable nature of the soul and to make of it something occult and entirely removed from the senses is the shortest way to atheism and materialism. 63 This kind of reasoning is in no way as idiosyncratic to Sweden­ borg as one may be tempted to believe. Time and again philosophers have, in an effort to save themselves from the supposed skeptical con­ sequences of Descartes' and Leibniz's dualism, attributed a spatial ex­ tension to the soul and envisaged the existence of reciprocal 41"

And it is precisely this same rea­ soning that we find again with certain writers who have felt the in­ fluence of mystical doctrines. Here I shall only cite two with whom Swedenborg is evidently familiar and who have undoubtedly con­ tributed to strengthen his conclusions on the spatiality of the soul. Henry More, an English contemporary of Descartes, influenced the Newtonian conception of space, as well as that of Locke and even (directly or indirectly) that of Kant, as recent research has strongly emphasized. More assigned to his philosophy the task of \"reintroduc­ ing God into the world by the same door through which Descartes had attempted to shut him out.\" In the course of a direct polemic with Descartes, More denies that extension constitutes matter. Space is a reality that exists outside bodies and our own thought. Every real thing consequently displays a certain extension. God is the subject of absolute space. The soul is as spatial and extended as the body. Start­ ing with this theory, More then launches into speculations on the presence of spirits in space and into the four-dimensional character of space-ideas that were later picked up by spiritualism. More was, moreover, a manifest theosophist, and he gave himself up to Kabbal­ istic interpretations of the Bible that rather closely resemble those of Swedenborg. 64 Perhaps even closer to Swedenborg, we find a contemporary German philosopher, Andreas Rudiger, who strongly felt the influ­ ence of More as well as that of the English alchemist Robert Fludd. In his chief work, Physica Divina, Rudiger sought to reconcile the mystic doctrines of the two English philosophers with the latest dis­ coveries of science and philosophy. This Physica Divina, along with another work by the same author, Von Wesen der Seeie, published in 1727, and in which Rudiger expounds his conception of the soul by way of notes on the work of Christian Wolff, formed part of the rather restricted library of Sweden borg. Rudiger, having more or less the same conception of space as More, whom he often cites, states that everything finite, and conse­ quently the soul itself, must have extension. He points out that the soul's activity necessarily assumes a substratum for this activity; we may not, then, identify the soul with the natural point. This is exactly the reasoning that we find again in Swedenborg (Prodromus §178ff.). 42"

Rudiger adduces the same proofs of the immortality of the soul as Swedenborg: due to its subtle character the soul could not be destroyed by the effect of natural causes (Physica Divina, 773). The reasons that determined Rudiger to acknowledge the spatiality of the soul are precisely those that ap­ peared to be decisive for Sweden borg: for the one as for the other, it is impossible to otherwise establish the existence of the soul within na­ ture and, even less, its relationship with the body. It is probable that Sweden borg was acquainted with Rudiger and that his reading of the German philosopher strengthened in his mind the conception of the soul's materiality that he had already acquired from Polhem, inas­ much as his contemporaries themselves have remarked the similarity of the two doctrines. In a review of the work of Swedenborg, pub­ lished in 1735 in the Acta Eruditorum, it is observed, apropos of the Swedenborgian doctrine of a soul subjected to mechanical and physi­ cal law, that the same thesis is already found in Rudiger, \"whom the author appears to have frequently followed.\" Thanks to his theory of the spatiality of the soul, Swedenborg comes to set a very definite line of demarcation between the infinite and the created universes. And the principal aim of the Prodromus is precisely to give a clear proof of the existence of God and of his rela­ tions with the universe. After having expounded in detail the physico-theological proof of God's existence (that is, that the need for a constructor is established by the ingeniousness and perfection of the mechanism), Swedenborg undertakes an ardent polemic, on the one hand against the pantheism that confuses finite nature with its infi­ nite cause, and on the other, against anthropomorphic conceptions of God. In an extensive argument that is not lacking in interest, Swedenborg seeks to prove that, in their tentative efforts to define the divinity, the various philosophical schools have attributed human qualities to it or have identified it with nature itself. He concludes that no finite attribute can be applied to the infinite (Prodromus § 100). For him, as for the Neoplatonists, God is indeterminable. And 43"

The infinite is the cause of the finite. But in the effect nothing of the cause subsists. Divinity cannot be placed in direct relation with a finite and imperfect universe (Prodromus §194ft). Swedenborg attempts to avoid the notion of God's directly cre­ ating the universe by supposing that he who is and who was from all eternity the Son of God, has served as a link between cause and effect, between the infinite and the finite. Since this Son is one with the Fa­ ther, it is not a question of mediated creation, although Swedenborg further maintains that only the primum creatum, the natural point, which has nothing of matter and which possesses the supreme perfec­ tion, is a direct creation of God. All the rest of the universe derives from this initial point. To the degree that things issue from the infi­ nite in a more mediated fashion, they have become less and less per­ fect, taking on more and more natural elements and less and less of the divine. The first created primitivum alone, then, is of immediate divinity: everything else in the universe is only mediately divine. For nothing can persist and live in the universe that has not its source and cause in the infinite (Prodromus §lS9). It is plain that we have here the framework of an emanationist system, similar to that that we find again in Sweden borg during his next period of development. In his above cited work De Mechanismo Animae et Corporis (Scientific and Philosophical Treatises §24), which is considered to be preparatory to the Prodromus, Swedenborg has scaled all the steps of the ladder beyond the limits of the sensory universe. For him, matter must exist that is even more simple than the initial matter of nature, and there must be souls still more subtle and active than ours. Swedenborg recalls that theology acknowledges the exis­ tence of various categories of angels: angels whose mission is to carry out the judgments of God; guardian angels watching over the human creature and leading him according to God's designs; angels carrying the soul into heaven; and finally, evil angels of grosser nature. And he concludes that such angels or mediating substances must exist with souls like ours but serve at a subtler level as intermediaries for the di­ vine providence.

It is, nevertheless, in the epistemological outline that serves as an introduction to the Principia that Swedenborg's imminent evolution towards mysticism stands out most clearly. Here he adopts the tradi­ tional division of the soul into an inferior vegetative soul, the animus, and the mens, which is the reason proper. From the external sense or­ gans, sensations are transmitted through ever more subtle media to the animus and thence to the mens. In its innermost active element, which we cannot explain with our mathematical laws, these sensa­ tions are turned into knowledge. We cannot, then, have access to knowledge except through the senses. But there is more. It is only progressively, in the course of our physical development, that the fine tissues that serve as intermediaries between the senses and the soul can be cultivated and acquire their right function. And it is only by the experience painfully accumulated by our ancestors and transmit­ ted from generation to generation and by using geometry and philos­ ophy as means that we have reached our present stage of knowledge. Just imagine a human creature having grown up without education among wild animals or apes, or even outside any sort of animal cul­ ture: what bestiality would not be his? Education alone creates and forms the human being and distinguishes it from the animal (Prodro­ mus §§4-S). This fundamental conception of the origin and conditions of human knowledge, of which Swedenborg here makes himself the in­ terpreter, is nothing more than the empiricism of Locke. How often, in the course of the era of the French Enlightenment, has not the ex­ ample mentioned above been used to illustrate the narrowness of the gap that separates the primitive human from the animal, and how that human, whose soul at birth is a tabula rasa, depends on impres­ sions from the outside world! For Swedenborg, this state of dependence on experience consti­ tutes a shortcoming in our knowledge. For him, it is exclusively to the Fall of the first man and woman that we owe our inability to acquire knowledge except through our senses; our incapacity to pur­ sue the deductive method without prior induction depends on the fact that our spiritual machinery has fallen into disorder.

In his original state of integrity, the first human must have had a perfect contiguity throughout his whole system. Such a person could be compared to the world, in which the rays of the sun, thanks to the contiguity of the elements through which they travel, freely strike the eyes. Likewise, all impressions striking the senses of this first human freely find their way to his most subtle and active mental organs. Such a perfect being would be capable of rapidly acquiring, through the sole mediation of the senses, all the philosophy and experiential knowledge he needed. He likewise would enjoy the most perfect cog­ itative faculty. Such a human could truly feel himself in the center of the universe and at a glance (uno quasi intuitu) could embrace its en­ tire periphery. By his knowledge of causes and the interrelationship of everything, he would also know the past, present, and future (Pro­ dromus §23). With respect to God, he would have a pure love devoid of all fear. And since God loves us to the same degree that we love him, we would have been the object of divine love. How different is the human situation after the Fall! Pleasures and desires have destroyed the slender tissues that transmit the stir­ rings of the organs of the body to the animus and to the mens. The mens can only imperfectly exercise over the individual the rule of which it has been despoiled. Thick clouds have gathered between the sun and his eyes and, if the sun's rays nevertheless manage to pene­ trate the overcast, they transmit only a refracted and distorteded image. We can no longer see the sun (Prodromus 24-25). And just as our reason is obscured, our love of God is polluted by fleshly desires. We can no longer establish a relationship with God other than through Christ, provided we try to live by his example. As we see, Swedenborg conceives the knowledge for which hu­ manity was originally created as a kind of irradiation of divine light. Here we find in outline form the Neoplatonic concept of God as a spiritual sun that will become a central principle of Swedenborgian doctrine beginning with the Economy of the Animal Kingdom.

In his theological works, Swedenborg maintains that people of the oldest church, \"the Adamites,\" were in direct contact with the divinity and that the organs of their souls functioned in all their original integrity. For this reason, they had a direct conception of good and truth; and they could immediately discover the correspondences, the spiritual and heavenly equivalents, in terrestrial phenomena. Thus, they could intuitively acquire knowledge of things and their ends. Thus assuming the existence of an intuitive knowledge with Adam before the Fall, Swedenborg involves himself in a reasoning dear to many Christian mystics, for whom Adam was endowed, in his original state of integrity, with intuitive knowledge. It is only after the Fall that all direct relations between God and man were broken. Finding themselves in a stage of mystic intuition, the mystics considered themselves as enjoying the same state as Adam before the Fall. Among many of them, this rationale was developed into a psy­ chological construction. They sought to explain the imperfection of our present knowledge by the circumstance that the Fall broke one of the springs of our spiritual mechanism and that, from then on, the latter has functioned only imperfectly. To give a concrete example of this conception, I refer to the ex­ position by the great Belgian physician and natural philosopher T.B. van Helmont, in his treatise on Intellectus Adamicus. 65 This example is even more interesting since there is reason to believe that the psy­ chological system later developed by Sweden borg is not without de­ pendence on the theories of the Belgian scholar. In the state of ignorance of good and evil, Adam's intellect (his mens) ruled as its sovereign mistress over his body, and he conse­ quently possessed perfect knowledge of all things. \"Siquidem ob/ato objecto non antea viso, noverat penitissimas ejus proprietates\" (If some object was brought before him that he had not previously seen, he knew its deepest characteristics; see above). It was only after the Fall that the lower soul (anima sensitiva) was created, enveloping the mens and making it impossible for the latter to transmit the divine light to the body or to rule over it.

But even in these stifling temptations of the flesh and resorting to meditation, human beings can immerse themselves entirely in di­ vinity and feel, for brief moments, the divine light illuminating the soul, enjoying intuitive knowledge, the only truth, and becoming one with divinity. Nothing in the Principia, any more than in Swedenborg's other works of the same period, acknowledges the possibility that the fallen human creature can partake in knowledge of this nature. But the fact that Sweden borg believed in the existence of this knowledge in pri­ mordial man, along with his mistrust of empirical knowledge, consti­ tutes a psychological foreshadowing of the way by which he will pass on to mysticism. The anonymous author of the review published in the Acta Eru­ ditorum of 1735, while expounding the Prodromus in complimentary and courteous terms, leaves it to be clearly understood in places that the theories of the author, in his opinion, lead to materialism. Swedenborg's characterization of the soul, \"the most subtle part of our body,\" cannot fail, the reviewer says, to appear \"somewhat gross\" (duriusculum) to many minds. He considers that the acceptance of this postulate necessarily implies the conclusion that matter is susceptible of thinking, and can, as a composition of substances, be dissolved and destroyed by natural causes. \"The partisan followers of the notion of influx find here the magnificent consequences which the principle of a physical union (between body and soul) imposes upon them.\"66 And in his Theologia Naturalis, Wolff categorically asserts that the ac­ ceptance of the spatiality of the soul inevitably leads to materialismP He particularly inveighs against those materialists-\"whether they recognize themselves as such or not\"-who reach this conclusion from supposing that simple being is nothing but the mathematical point and who therefrom make a complex substance of the soul. This is probably the passage where Swedenborg thought he was referred to, when in his journal he records, under date ofJuly 20,1736, that he has read the Theologia Naturalis of Wolff, \"in which there appears somewhat to be a question of my person, without name.\"68 48"

He attributed to the soul, not only spatial extension, but---contrary to Riidiger-a certain elasticity, and he was without doubt sincerely convinced that it was only a more subtle body. His hypothesis, according to which certain parts of the soul could be lost in the universal space at the moment of death, adequately demon­ strates how precarious were the proofs of immortality that he ad­ duced for himself. For him, the functions of the soul were still only a transmission of motion. To be sure, he admitted the existence of an active principle, the equivalent of which was not present in animals, but not once is it seen how this activity differs from what he assumes to exist in all the particles of matter. It might well appear that his me­ chanical cosmology tends to reduce the role of God to that of first cause, the creator of the natural point from which the whole visible universe evolves. But in reality, although they were as yet not clearly formulated, Swedenborg's tendencies were already oriented in an entirely differ­ ent direction. Through his mechanistic interpretation of physical and psychic processes, he seeks to demonstrate that all motion and all life have their existence only from the infinite that is origin, cause, and end, and that the body lives and moves only from the soul. The entire universe is directly or mediately divine (Prodromus § 160ff.). It is thus, in his imagination, that the immense universal mechanism, moving according to mechanical laws, step by step lays the basis for the con­ ception of the grand universal organism, of the greatest human, drawing its life and activity from the infinite. Likewise for the ordi­ nary man, the microcosm, all life, and all consciousness are but an ir­ radiation of divine light. When Swedenborg undertakes to pull down the wall erected between spirit and matter by Cartesianism, he is cer­ tainly driven above all by the desire to regard all spiritual phenomena as material in a way explicable according to mechanical law. When his mystical tendencies become progressively more marked and his religious interests carry him beyond his scientific interests, he comes to draw the opposite conclusions from the same monistic point of view. He comes to spiritualize the entire universe and to consider the body as the ultimate reflection of the soul. 49"

It is the period when his ideas are transformed into a philosophy of nature tinged with theol­ ogy, which later becomes the foundation of his theosophy .

We have seen how this problem had preoccupied him from the beginning of his scientific activities and how he tried to solve it in different ways without achieving any satisfactory result.

Drawing this metaphysical conclusion from the law of gravity, Newton aligned himself, as has been frequently re­ marked, with the ideas of the Cambridge Platonists. By introducing a \"plastic force\" into their system and acknowledging the existence of spatial but immaterial spiritual substances as intermediaries between God and matter, the Platonists sought to discard, in favor of teleolog­ ical and organic concepts, every mechanical explanation of nature, which, in their opinion, could only lead to materialistic and atheistic results. The explanation of distant action of a body given by Newton tended also in the same direction. \"Das mathematische Gesetz wird unter dem Namen der Fernkrafi versinnbildlicht und anthromorphisiert\" (The mathematical principle becomes symbolized and anthropomor­ phized under the name of \"gravity\").69 Leibniz's philosophy aimed at reconciling the Cartesian view of nature with the Aristotelian teleological view, achieving a compro­ mise between the mechanical and organic interpretations of the uni­ verse. Leibniz reached this conclusion by considering bodies as representations of an internal, nonmaterial force. While he kept the mechanical interpretation of physical phenomena, his monadology gave the very nature of things an explanation that transformed the universe into a living whole occupied by animated substances. Lass­ witz emphasized that this metaphysical interpretation of the universe by Leibniz's successors was directly applied to physical phenomena.7° And it is thus that his monadology became the starting point for most of the attempts to substitute the hylozoistic doctrine of living mole­ cules for mechanical atomism, a doctrine that we find also among a good number of philosophers and naturalists of the eighteenth century. As we have seen, Swedenborg was already acquainted with Leibniz and, with respect to certain details, was influenced by him. Nevertheless, the latter does not appear to have been granted full credit in the mind of Swedenborg until, in the course of writing the Principia, he found occasion to renew his acquaintance with the Leib­ nizian doctrine, although in the somewhat diluted form it took in the works of Christian Wolff.

Contemporaneous with Leibniz, and partly under his influence, the same tendency toward an organic conception of the universe ap­ peared in the physical and natural sciences, particularly in medicine, where the main thrust previously had been toward interpretation of physiological phenomena as purely mechanical or chemical processes. The most characteristic expression of this tendency is the theory known as \"animism,\" whose founder, the celebrated doctor Georg Ernst Stahl, was represented by several of his works in Swedenborg's library. In Stahl's system, the soul (anima) structures the body for its own purposes, and the organs have life only through it. Maladies are caused by psychic malfunctions, which are in large part healed by al­ tering the psychic regime}! Because of their metaphysical point of departure, Stahl and his school opposed all detailed study of anatomy. But a clearly organic perspective was attained even in this domain through other avenues. With the aid of a microscope, living elements seemed to be perceived everywhere-in the sperm, in the blood, and even in the ovaries. Things apparently devoid of life are themselves filled with living or­ ganisms. Leeuwenhoeck discovered a multitude of infusorians in a drop of water. As a result of these discoveries, the concept of inor­ ganic matter, which was the basis of the atomism of the seventeenth century, gave way to diverse and rather obscure theories about or­ ganic matter as a kind of whole that is made up of living microscopic entities, whose combinations produce individuals that are more and more differentiated. This molecular theory found its principal protagonist in George Buffon, for whom infusorians were animal molecules; but it had, both before and after Buffon, notable represen­ tatives in the field of medicine and in the natural sciences. In agreement with this discovery stands the old doctrine of spontaneous generation or generatio aequivoca, again picked up by most of the molecularists, which has numerous parallels with this theory. Some among them acknowledged that every living being is born of spontaneous generation (generatio aequivolata), while others restricted this hypothesis to lower microscopic forms.

This altered view of nature was validated in all fields. The great Haller, a contemporary of Swedenborg, is not the only one to wel­ come a new target for his activity in creating what he calls \"belebte Anatomie.\" In all circles, among scholars and thinkers as well as among poets, the same trend appears: to see organic life where their precursors discerned only mechanical or chemical transformations. The diatribe of young Thorild against \"these mechanical, soulless minds who strive to present nature as inanimate clockwork\" is char­ acteristic of efforts throughout the eighteenth century to see some­ thing of life in nature, a tendency that well explains many facets of the spiritual life of that century.

A large share of the discov­ eries that furnished a scientific basis for the new organic conception of the world were yet to be made or lay almost unknown. To cite only one example, Haller's doctrine of irritability, which is probably the starting point of the explanation of physiological processes that was laid down by the next generation of scientists, was published almost simultaneously with Economy of the Animal Kingdom. It follows that Swedenborg, like his contemporaries, could not develop the organic theory in all its details and that he often resorted to old hypotheses. But he also mixed a certain number of mystical speculations in with his medical theories. The medical systems of the age, particularly the more modern ones, which had renounced the chemical or mechanical explanation, often constituted a peculiar mixture of experimental research and ab­ struse metaphysical considerations. They shared the common charac­ teristic of carelessly falling back on supernatural factors in the absence of scientific explanations. When Sweden borg abandoned his mathematical and mechanical pursuits to dedicate himself to medical and zoological studies, he in effect abandoned a field where exact sci­ ence had advanced considerably for one where the most extravagant 53"

Empirical science had not yet, in Sweden or abroad, broken the bonds that linked it with alchemy or astrology, and medicine was particularly flawed, as a rule, by superstition and quackery. Even the most illustrious names in the contemporary field of medicine were no exceptions in this respect. Two of the most promi­ nent representatives of German medicine of that day, Friedrich Hoff­ mann and Georg Ernst Stahl, whose works figured in the library of Swedenborg, were both decided mystics, believing that demons were involved in diseases and attributing to the stars a considerable influ­ ence on the development of maladies. The wearing of amulets fig­ ured in their therapeutic prescriptions. Alongside highly noteworthy and precise medical discoveries, we find in their works an astonish­ ingly superstitious interpretation of certain clinical phenomena. Thus, for example, Hoffmann considers the abrupt appearance of harmful insects in the atmosphere, or of worms in the soil, as the work of the devil.72 Through his prior study of contemporary medical literature, then, Swedenborg found himself in contact with a philosophy of na­ ture clearly tinged with mysticism; and, in his Economy of the Animal Kingdom, we can find numerous elements that can be directly traced to that philosophy. Moreover at this time his purely philosophical studies naturally provided further nourishment for his mystical tendencies. Thanks to the careful interaction of references included in the Economy of the Animal Kingdom, we are very well instructed regarding his philo­ sophical reading at that time. They are in themselves a kind of guide to the understanding of his spiritual orientation. The author most frequently cited in this work is Aristotle. It is he whom Swedenborg invokes constantly as the supreme authority, and, like the scholastics, he distinguishes him most often not by name but as \"the philosopher.\" Aristotle is, moreover, one of the few thinkers for whom Sweden borg reserves his admiration during his theosophical period.

This predilection for Aristotle is not to be wondered at. The his­ toriographers of mysticism have often mentioned the peculiar fact that the philosophy of Aristotle, however hostile it may be toward mystical sentiment, and though it strives toward exact and rigorous analysis, has always been, since the scholastic era, clearly allied with numerous mystical systems. The explanation has been found in Aris­ totle's definition of God as the absolute reality, acting upon the world in view of the fact that imperfect things aspire to divine perfection. To know the highest human capacity of thought, the spiritual vision (theoria), is to share pure thought, which is the very essence of deity and an enjoyment ofbeatitude,73 We are to see that these Aristotelian notions appear also in Swedenborg's philosophy in the Economy of the Animal Kingdom and that they will be retained in Sweden borg's theo­ logical system. The influence exercised upon Swedenborg by Plato and by Neo­ platonism, the principal sources of Christian mysticism, is naturally even greater. Sweden borg was acquainted with the work of Plato, not only by Aristotle's exposition of it, but also directly. In his works dating from this period, we find quotations from many of Plato's Dialogues. On the other hand, Swedenborg's works contain no quotations from Plotinus, a circumstance allowing Tafel to deny categorically that Sweden borg had ever studied that philosopher,74 This statement can be disproven by the fact that Swedenborg, in 1705, had inscribed his name on the title page of a volume of the Opera philosophica of Plotinus, which had once belonged to Stjernhjelm, and which the lat­ ter called his pabulum animi (food of the soul),75 Among the works cited in the Economy of the Animal Kingdom, we also find a purely Neoplatonic one that includes long extracts from Plotinus' Enneads. This is known as The Theology of Aristotle, of which we possess an Arabic text, dating from from around 840, but which is considered to date back to a lost Greek text; it is credited to a member of the Neo­ platonic school, perhaps Porphyry. Swedenborg refers to it under the name of Aristotle, and the title that it bears in the Latin translation of 1572 (De Secretiore Parte Divinae Sapientiae Secundum Aegyptios). In a 55"

It is occasionally almost impossible to distinguish in Sweden­ borg's works between the influence traceable to the Church Fathers and that of the Neoplatonists. He appears to have been quite familiar with the former, a number of whom are referred to in his works. We find, for example, long quotations from Lactantius and Augus­ tine, whom he greatly admired at that time for \"the clarity of his judgment.\" It is more difficult to establish Swedenborg's knowledge of me­ dieval and modern mysticism. No reference whatsoever to German mystics is found in his works, and any parallels observable between their doctrines and his own may very well be based on a second-hand acquaintance through Arndt or van Helmont. I find it hardly likely, however, that the son of Jesper Swedberg had never read Thomas a Kempis or the Theologia Germanica. Regarding French Quietism, there is every reason to suppose that Swedenborg had read Mme. Guyon and Mme. Bourignan, whose works were commonly read as edifying texts at that time. In any case, he had become acquainted with some of their basic views through the works of Nicolaus Malebranche, which were found in his library and which exercised an influence on his philosophy in the Economy of the Animal Kingdom. Naturally, Swedenborg could not have avoided acquaintance with the medical systems of the Renaissance, such as those of Paracel­ sus and van Helmont, which were strongly colored by Kabbalistic philosophy. It is probable that he had read these two masters in the original,77 But even if there were reason to doubt this, one could find enough medical works that he cites, or that he had in his library, that belong to this school to fully explain their reflections in Swedenborg's philosophy. As for Jacob Boehme, Swedenborg himself stated, in a letter to Gabriel Beyer in 1767, that he had never read Boehme's writings, and added in connection therewith that he had been \"forbidden to read 56"

Swedenborg must at least have known the outlines of Boehme's sys­ tem that were picked up by Dippel. Some of the latter's works, more­ over, contain such a wealth of quotations from modern mystics and magicians that these citations alone would have sufficed to give Swedenborg an overview of contemporary mysticism. I have already spoken of Swedenborg's early acquaintance with Fludd's disciple Rudiger and have mentioned his relationship to the Neoplatonic Cambridge school. A glance at the catalog of his library shows that he owned books on magic, alchemy, and occultism, and surely knew of many others. I have dealt at length upon what we know about the extensive mystical reading of Sweden borg in order to discredit once and for all the attempt, so frequently made by orthodox researchers on Sweden­ borg, to exonerate him from any reliance on other mystical writers or from any influence deriving from such a source. This effort is cer­ tainly well-intentioned but hopelessly unhistorical as well as psycho­ logically invalid. During his theosophical period, Swedenborg appears to have refrained from any theological reading, but this was no doubt for the purpose of avoiding interference with his own thinking. Like most mystics, he was convinced that all his theosophi­ cal ideas were directly inspired by God, and he protests energetically when certain of his contemporaries-wrongly, I believe-regarded some of them as having been borrowed from Boehme. Yet Sweden­ borg never goes as far as his apologists in the denying all contacts with mysticism; had he done so, he would not have been believed. There is an anachronism in claiming that such a cultured mind as Swedenborg's could have remained a stranger to mystical ideas during an era when mysticism occupied so preponderant a place in 57"

Before leaving his paternal hearth, Swedenborg became acquainted with mystical doctrines; he came across them later in science clothed in alchemy and speculative medicine. During the period when he wrote the Economy of the Animal Kingdom and Animal Kingdom, a period of intense activity for the Swedish mystical sects;these doctrines were a daily topic of general conversation; and it was in the ranks of these sects, and more particularly in those of Dip­ pelianism, that they were to find the greater number of disciples. When we add that Swedenborg was particularly engrossed in the so­ lution of problems most hotly discussed by the mystics, the absurdity of arguing that he remained completely unaware of contemporary mysticism becomes plain. But precisely because this knowledge of mystical systems has a long background in Sweden borg's life, I am not inclined to assume that the study of mystical literature was the main reason that he left the philosophy of Principia. For similar reasons, I cannot believe that the decisive role in Sweden borg's conversion should be attributed to the influence of Dippel, which the Swedenborgians likewise deny. Naturally, we can in no way overlook the fact that Sweden­ borg's transition to mysticism took place precisely during the decade that marked the triumph of Swedish Pietism, that is, a time when re­ ligiosity sought to manifest itself in Sweden in its most ecstatic forms and with an energy known neither before or later there, when mirac­ ulous conversions, inspired dreams, revelations, prophesies, the speaking in tongues, and other manifestations of the same order were daily occurrences; when the consistories and tribunals sat in judg­ ment on heresy; when every week witnessed the establishment of new conventicles or of new sects, often with fantastic doctrines, and of more or less extravagant cults. Such a highly charged religious at­ mosphere obviously could not fail to act upon even such a genuine closet-scholar as Sweden borg and to accelerate, in some measure, his religious conversion. But nothing warrants a belief that he was ever a disciple of any of these sects. Holmquist and other theological researchers on Swedenborg presume that he had met Dippel during the latter's so­ journ in Stockholm from 1726 to 1727, and attribute a great impor­ tance to this meeting in Sweden borg's conversion.7 9 If he was actually 58"

Swedenborg declares that when he passed through Copenhagen in 1736, \"he found the city still infected with Pietism; or Quakerism. In their folly they believe in making them­ selves agreeable to God through suicide or murder, numerous exam­ ples of which exist.\"8o The least one can conclude from this declaration is that it indicates no sympathy for the sects referred to. On the other hand, it appears incontestable in certain passages of the Spiritual Diary (§2890ff., §3485ff. and elsewhere) that Sweden­ borg had read Dippel's works, and we shall see that several specific points are important in the structure of his philosophical system of Economy of the Animal Kingdom. Still more significant is Dippel's in­ fluence on Swedenborg's theology such as it appears to us in its full state of development. Consequently, it seems to me very likely that Swedenborg, over a more or less extended period, had been subject to the influence of Dippel. Nothing allows us to pinpoint this influence, however. It does not appear to me likely to have had the range some have wanted to make out, and I see no reason to suppose that this in­ fluence may explain the departure from the philosophy of Principia to the mystical view of Economy of the Animal Kingdom. It is still less probable that such influence may have determined the violent reli­ gious crisis that followed later, and of which we learn from his Jour­ nal of Dreams for the years 1734-1744-a crisis, following which Sweden borg abandoned science for theology. Indeed, he seems to have begun that period while in contact with the English Moravian Church, which he briefly considered joining. If I am little disposed to see the decisive factor for Sweden borg's conversion in his mystical readings or in his supposed association with the diverse religious sects, it is principally because the history of mysticism teaches us that it is neither by their reading nor through personal influences that the great mystics generally realize their mis­ sion. On a closer look, one finds that the beginning of their mystical commitment is more often related to a personal experience that they considered to be divine revelation. This is not necessarily the first mystical manifestation in their lives; they are often born visionaries, 59"

The kind of revelation that concerns us here is often produced initially at a mature age, following years of con­ fused meditations regarding problems they appear powerless to re­ solve. An external stimulus, often of a rather banal character, seems to give them a kind of sudden internal clarity, an intuitive certainty that was previously lacking. This does not at all mean, on the other hand, that their systems are always clear from the start or that they become fully structured mystics in a moment. But their destinies from then on are determined. From the moment they receive this call they see that their thoughts are divinely inspired. The godhead hav­ ing deigned in a moment of grace to make them participants in its own light, they are called henceforth to proclaim to ordinary human reason the things hidden from us. To illustrate what has been said above, I want to remind the reader of the well-known experience of Jacob Boehme. During his wandering years as a shoemaker, he had felt the vague presentiment that some day he would be called to a rather extraordinary mission. But torn between contending Protestant sects, he was the prey of in­ decision, and the vision he had brought him no guidance. One day, after establishing himself as a shoemaker in Garlitz, his eyes fixed themselves on a light shining in a tin plate. He immediately experi­ enced an elevation of soul, feeling he was suddenly suffused by an inner clarity so miraculous that he believed himself empowered to penetrate the very essence of things. Ten years passed before he dared to record the truth revealed to him. But his road is thenceforth mapped out; and, in his mind, the moment the reflection of the sun in the tin struck his eyes remained for him the time of initiation into higher knowledge. From Swedenborg's Principia, we have been able to conclude the problem that particularly preoccupies his mind at this time. He wants to know whether a human being can again share the intuitive knowledge of Adam that our species had lost after the Fall. Neither physiology nor philosophy offers him an answer to this question. Knowledge of this nature is well beyond the reach of discursive rea­ son; only from personal experience can one know whether it exists. 60"

In his Imago Mentis, he relates that once, when weary after prolonged contemplation, he had felt his spirit was transported in slumber beyond the limitations of reason and per­ ceived, through a cleft in the wall, a light of inexpressible clarity.81 As a consequence of this vision, which was beyond the power of words to describe, van Helmont was seized by an overwhelming desire to know the soul, a longing that knew no respite during twenty-three long years. Only when he was allowed to see his mens in human form, streaming like a crystal-clear light of inexpressible and incom­ prehensible brilliance, was he able to understand the vanity of these twenty-three years of striving. Even this vision, as beautiful as it was, could not teach him about his mens intellectually; the vision could only reveal the existence of the mens without being able to add any­ thing to its perfection. Was it perhaps an experience of the same order that first convinced Swedenborg of the possibility of an intu­ itive awareness, thus determining the orientation of his entire later thinking? At first sight, the question appears impossible to answer. For the document that might have informed us in this respect, Sweden borg's account of his visions of 1736 to 1740, was detached by an officious hand from the manuscript (entrusted to the care of the Academy of Sciences) to be returned to the Swedenborg family; and it then disap­ peared without a trace. We can only rely upon one fact: that from 1736 on, the same years during which he began to write his Economy of the Animal Kingdom, Sweden borg also began to record his dreams and visions. This most significant coincidence allows us to suppose that these visions directly relate to the psychological and scientific speculations that occupied his mind at the time. Like the visions of the diaries for 1743-1744, as we shall see, they bear a close relation­ ship with the scientific research that he pursued during the same period.82 In an overlooked passage in Swedenborg's diary for 1743-1744, we come across a recollection of one of his prior visions.

Swedenborg records on October 27,1743 (Journalo/Dreams §282): In the morning, on awakening, I was overcome by such a dizzi­ ness or one such fading of consciousness or deliquium by which I had been seized previously six or seven years ago in Amsterdam, when I began to write my Economy; but this time more subtle, feeling myself near to death. And it then happened when I saw the light, but which dissipated little by little, because I fell into a brief slumber, so that this deliquium was internal and more pro­ found, yet quietly passed; from which I understood that my head was cleared and truly relieved of all that could hinder these thoughts; which occurred as on the preceding occasion, and that this endowed me with the faculty of penetration. This former occurrence must be related to Swedenborg's second sojourn in Amsterdam, August 17-20, 1736. He would return to that city only in December 1739, where he would finish his Economy of the Animal Kingdom. It is apparent that this occurrence was no more than a loss of consciousness, following which Swedenborg had felt his thoughts \"purified\" and found himself endowed with \"penetration.\" The as­ sumption is based on the grounds that this state was provoked by that respiratory suspension to which Sweden borg, as he himself relates, was accustomed ever since his childhood (see chapter one above). Mention of this \"internal breathing\" is already found in Economy of the Animal Kingdom. 83 It constituted the basis of Swedenborg's physi­ ological theory about the relation between the brain and the lungs. And in the detailed description of this phenomenon cited above, which we find in the Spiritual Diary §3464, Swedenborg relates that he had experienced this respiration while he was writing the works that were published later.84 Since these records come from the year 1747, only the natural scientific works can come into question, as Tafel notes. Swedenborg here says, moreover, that this internal breathing usually occurred while he was studying the interaction be­ tween heart and lungs: 62"

Swedenborg believes this respiration can also be experienced while asleep, for he says, \"I noticed again and again that after falling asleep [external] respiration was almost entirely withdrawn from me, so that on awakening I gasped for breath.\" And in closing he asserts: \"By this means it was also granted me to be present with spirits.\" In his theosophy, Sweden borg further develops the doctrine that internal respiration comes from heaven, while ordinary breathing comes from the world. When, at the moment of death, external res­ piration ceases, internal breathing continues. It varies according to our state of blessedness, so that the breathing of angels is internal, while that of the inhabitants of hell have a more external respiration. In the beginning, human beings were created for internal breathing, which they preserved while in their original state of integrity; it is from the moment when it ceases, that we lose all bonds with heaven. 85 When we know about this theory of internal breathing, it is easy to understand how the deliquium of which Sweden borg speaks is produced. In the course of intense intellectual concentration, a respi­ ratory inhibition intervenes, to which Sweden borg has been accus­ tomed since childhood; this inhibition provokes a fainting fit with a sensation of imminent death. The breathing \"continued while I saw the light,\" which helps explain a concomitant phenomenon. Cer­ tainly, it is here not a matter of sunlight, for the phenomenon took place at night, but of a mystic light.

They generally classify it as a phenomenon of hallucinatory or pseudohallucinatory sensory au­ tomatism and designate it under the technical name of \"photism.\" It constitutes one of the customary mystic phenomena, and numerous examples have been collected, from the heavenly vision of Paul on the road to Damascus to the religious conversions of our day. I find it enough here to refer to the well-known work of William James,88 the source of the above definition, and who provides several concrete ex­ amples of photism. The fact that it is here a matter of a confirmatory luminous appearance experienced by Swedenborg at the moment of undertaking his Economy of the Animal Kingdom, is plain from the al­ ways-overlooked preface to this work, which clearly explains how he passed over from science into mysticism. His travel journal shows that this preface was written around September 6 or 7, 1736, that is, only about three weeks after the revelation mentioned above occurred. 89 The preface to Economy of the Animal Kingdom constitutes an introduction to Swedenborg's study of the composition of the blood, but in reality it deals mainly with the question of knowledge, and perhaps also includes a piece of self-confession. The point of departure is the same as in the introduction to the Principia: \"We are born into dense ignorance and insensibility. Our organs are opened only by degrees; the images and notions as first re­ ceived are obscure and, so to speak, the whole universe is represented to the eye as a single indistinct thing, a formless chaos.

For when the mens \"vis propria contemplativa\" (\"with all the speculative force that belongs to it\") is left to rove abroad by itself without this guide, how easy it is to fall into error from these into other errors and finally into the error of errors ....

(Economy of the Animal Kingdom I, § 11) As we see, Swedenborg's view is more empirical here even than in the Principia. He seems to perceive no other road to knowledge than that of experience which, personal at first, can gradually become general with the support of the experience of others. And he ac­ knowledges that he has been too constructive in the course of his pre­ ceding scientific activity. Misled by his self-esteem and from isolated experiences, he had sought to draw general conclusions and establish definitive principles. This time he proposes to adhere more or less ex­ clusively to the exposition of discoveries by other thinkers. Self­ esteem and vanity, he tells us, are the worst enemies of science. Most scientists work without any true vocation for their calling. They build castles in the air that they then gravely offer to the admiration of the public. They believe that beyond their own muddy lake no more territory exists (cf. Economy of the Animal Kingdom I, §20). Against these figures, Swedenborg sets the natural-born scien­ tists, for special talents are necessary in order to deduce the causality of things from given phenomena, and these faculties are not given to everybody. We know that poets, musicians, singers, painters, architects, and sculptors are born with their respective gifts; it is the same with thinkers. From birth, they are endowed with a particular 65"

By these signs, he recognizes the existence of a kind of rational instinct that tells him that the soul has been sum­ moned into a kind of more intimate communion and has returned at that moment into the golden age of its original integrity (Economy of the Animal Kingdom I, §19). Swedenborg concludes by saying that the soul, having once known this joy, consecrates itself thenceforth exclu­ sively to research, disdainful of all corporeal pleasures. It appears to me beyond cavil that such is the confirmatory lu­ minous vision of which Sweden borg is thinking here in the preface to Economy of the Animal Kingdom. This sensation of ecstatic bliss that he attributes to himself is found to be marked in all the examples of photism reported by James. James also adds that the descriptions of sensory photisms that he had occasion to study \"end by being no longer anything more than metaphorical descriptions of the feeling of new internal illumination.\"9o Such is precisely the case of the descrip­ tion provided by Swedenborg in the Economy of the Animal Kingdom. Through this metaphorical transformation, Swedenborg comes to frame a kind of theory of intuition that hardly differs from that of Locke. In order to keep from skirting the outer limits of skepticism and being constrained to acknowledge the relativity of all knowl­ edge, Locke had conceived of an intuitive knowledge beyond sensa­ tion and reflection. This intuitive knowledge is an irresistible certitude granted to us when our reason discovers the concordance or antinomy of two ideas as clearly as the eye perceives the light as soon as it is turned that way. There we have the clearest and surest knowl­ edge of which our human fallibility is capable, and it is upon this that all certitude and all evidence in our understanding depend.91 Cassirer has observed that, in admitting the existence of intu­ itive knowledge, Locke entirely demolishes his psychological sys­ tem.92 It is in vain that he seeks to establish accord between the two avenues of knowledge by applying to them two different categories 66"

In a passage in Economy of the Animal Kingdom where he gives a detailed description of the anima, the organ of intuition, Sweden­ borg himself appeals to \"the illustrious Locke\" and cites, among oth­ ers, the Essay Concerning Human Understanding, in which Locke proposes the thesis that the angels and spirits of the righteous are to enjoy, in a future life, a knowledge analogous to our intuition. 93 If we recall the epistemological pessimism of Principia, Sweden­ borg's development becomes fairly clear. In his anguished medita­ tions on trying to find an infallible criterion of truth and on the means by which humankind might rediscover the certain knowledge that it possessed before the Fall, he finds in Locke the concept of a knowledge that is not obliged to have recourse to the always uncer­ tain discursive method. He could not have suspected that this theory, propounded by the universally recognized father of empiricism, would tend to include \"occult qualities.\" But by his conception of in­ tuitive knowledge, Swedenborg introduced a mystical element into his scientific world. It awakens all his congenital inclinations that had lain dormant for many years. So when, during the course of an intellectual effort, a light sud­ denly appears before his eyes, he finds its explanation at hand. There is a \"sacred temple\" in the brain. It is the Deity himself who with his flaming light confirms Sweden borg's theory. The bond between the human creature and the infinite is not broken; the person reverts, so to speak, at that moment, to the \"Golden Age of his primitive state.\" It is readily understandable that, from his faith in these intermittent flashes, Swedenborg should have passed on to the Neoplatonic con­ ception of a permanent light that, proceeding from the Divinity, shines within us each time we no longer try to withdraw from it vol­ untarily. In its broad lines, the philosophy of the Economy of the Ani­ mal Kingdom is already found complete. But there is more.

All created things owe their qualitative determination and purpose to form. \"Matter longs for form as the female longs for the male, and form cannot be abstracted from matter except in thought, \" he writes, quoting Aristotle (Economy of the Animal Kingdom II, §286). With this doctrine, Swedenborg combines the theory, drawn from mystical philosophy, of a natural creative force, of an archeus, a mystic principle of life; flowing from the primitive substance of na­ ture, the natural point, the archeus acts in everything as a creative, di­ rective, and underlying principle: Est quaedam Substantia aut Vis formatrix , quae a primo puncto vivente ducit stamen, et ductum usque ad ultimum vitae continuat; quae aliis vocatur Vis plastica, Archeus, et nonnullis simpliciter natura agens, sed intelligibili s magis, uti reor, si illa respective ad for­ mationis opus, audiat vis aut substantia formatrix .

In­ deed, the word archeus is used by Paracelsus and van Helmont, who apply it to the creative force; it is to the doctrine of these two philoso­ phers that Swedenborg appears to be most intimately attached. The \"plastic force\" is the name for the archeus in Ralph Cudworth and Henry More. Certain philosophers resort to a terminology rather close to that of Swedenborg. Marcus Marci, \"The Plato of Bohemia,\" gives the creative force the name of idea formatrix (formative idea). Like Sweden borg, he combines this formative idea with the Aris­ totelian conception of form. This is also picked up by other mystic philosophers known to Sweden borg, such as Rudiger and Dippel. The closest definition is that of van Helmont, who characterizes the archeus as an \"aura vitalis, productor et sustentator omnium rerum\" (a living aura, protector and sustainer of all things). For van Helmont, this living aura is, in the animal species, represented by the most sub­ tle component of the blood, which he calls spiritus vitalis, and which accords, to a certain degree, with the conception of Swedenborg, for whom the vis formatrix (formative power) is constituted in the animal kingdom by the jluidum spirituosum. Sweden borg has the same mystic conception of this vis formatrix as his predecessors. In its quality as universal and perfect substance, it is beyond the sphere of articulate speech and ordinary formalities; no word is adequate to describe it. It reigns as sovereign mistress at the heart of the microcosm that it has created and of which it is in some way \"semidea, Lar tutelaris, genius\" (half-divine, tutelary deity, genius; Economy of the Animal Kingdom I, §2S9). It is the germ of the micro­ cosm in which preexist all the stages through which the latter is to pass on the way to its final destination. But this mighty force is in turn only an emanation of the master of nature. It is only perfect to the extent that it remains its image. As we see, through this vis forma­ trix Sweden borg transforms the mechanical image of the universe as 70"

By combining this doctrine of a vis formatrix with the Aris­ totelian notion of form, Swedenborg now establishes a relationship that is both causal and teleological, between all the organisms that constitute the universe. To this systematized transformation from higher substances to inferior ones, he gives the name of \"the doctrine of series and degrees.\" In a certain sense, we find here a continuation of the conception of cosmological transformation that he expounded in the Principia, and one can observe in Swedenborg's prior works certain tendencies toward a general doctrine of organic progression in the universe. This doctrine, however, will be found completely de­ veloped in the definitive form that it will henceforth have in the theological system of Sweden borg (as the doctrine of discrete degrees) only in the eighth chapter of part I of the Economy of the Animal Kingdom. Swedenborg clearly states that, by the term \"degree\" in this con­ text, he in no way understands it as the difference between various quantities of a like quality, \"quantitates qualitatum\" (Economy of the Animal Kingdom I, §583). In that way, only \"continuous\" relative de­ grees are obtained (cf. his discussion of this subject in Divine Love and Wisdom §184ff.). The distinct degrees in question here are not per­ ceptible by the help of the senses alone, as the other degrees are. They require a complete knowledge of the genesis and continuity of the universe and rest, in large part, on analogical conclusions. By means of these degrees, we can see how simple substances are transformed into more complex ones and, even in the course of their evolution, continue to be defined by them. They reveal to us the whole scale of created beings from the primary and simple substance of the unIverse. Except for this primordial substance, the whole universe is in ef­ fect divided into \"series,\" themselves combined into degrees, each of which combines a series of several degrees, and so on. The most ex­ tensive series is that of the six kingdoms of nature. As an illustrative example, Swedenborg compares the system to a tree composed of a series of branches, each of which includes a series of boughs, etc. The first substance of each series is the simplest, comprising in a sense the 71"

It is that from which all the other substances derive, and there exists among them all the same causal relationship, so that the substance directly determined by the primitive substance of the series gives birth to the following one, and so on. We find, then, a complete causal chain in each series (Economy of the Animal Kingdom I, §594ff.). The prior substance in the series can be thought of as indepen­ dent of the one that follows it, but not of the preceding one. The prior substances are more universal and of a more perfect quality than those that follow (Economy of the Animal Kingdom I, §612). Through the series, all relationships in the universe emerge. That is why the series do not govern visible existence exclusively, and all spiritual life has them to thank for its existence. All science, all forms of govern­ ment are constituted by series. Through the series we understand, think, and act. In their absence, nature perishes (Economy of the Ani­ mal Kingdom I, §586). Our entire spiritual life is to be explained only through consid­ ering the human organism as a series of diverse degrees, acting some upon the others and having causal relations between them. It is through the intermediate determinants that the highest faculty of the soul, the anima, finds itself in relationship with the body. This psy­ chological thesis, destined to replace the harmonia prestabilita (preestablished harmony), without the necessity of resorting to in­ fluxus physicus or occasionalism, was given by Swedenborg the name of harmonia constabilita (established harmony). Thanks to series and degrees, the universe acquires a sort of general uniformity. It governs the same varietas harmonica in the mi­ crocosm as in the macrocosm. Thereby this theory likewise gives us the possibility of acquiring, with the help of experience, an intimate knowledge of nature. From the study of the highest subsequent de­ grees of a series (the more complex designs constituting aggregates), we can in effect deduce the existence of more simple and earlier de­ grees of the series (Economy of the Animal Kingdom I, §628ff.). It seems to me quite evident that, in elaborating this doctrine, Swedenborg principally had in mind the organic gradation of Aris­ totle.

In one passage of his works, Sweden borg identi­ fies his doctrine of series and degrees with that of the relations exist­ ing between form and matter. 94 In another passage (Economy of the Animal Kingdom II, §244), he describes the gradation of forms in the universe. In the lowest degree, form represents both the outer and the inner structure of a body. Thereby he also means the structure of other things that have no bodily form; thus, we speak of forms of government, forms of motion, forms of words, etc. At a higher de­ gree, form means image (imago), that is, such as it appears to the ani­ mus, when abstracted from matter. At a still higher degree, it is pure form (nuda forma), or according to others, idea, for at this level it be­ comes abstracted from any figuration, dimension, motion, or limits. If we follow this ascending scale, we reach the universal in all its complexity, that is, theformaformarum naturalium. All transcendence toward yet higher forms leads us above and beyond the universe to where the intuitive motion of the soul and the scope of the language cease. All description of these forms is only a vain juggling of words. When we apply the denomination of forma formarum to the fluidum spirituosum, we must assume that it is a matter of representation of the entire universe, including phenomena that our mind (mens) is in­ capable of visualizing. For nothing exists in the human body that does not answer to something higher in the universe. 95 In the Economy of the Animal Kingdom, the number of degrees that comprise a series is arbitrary. Nevertheless, Swedenborg already declares (Economy of the Animal Kingdom I, §601) that a complete se­ ries has to include at least three degrees, one determinant (agens), one determined (patiens), and a degree intermediate between the two. Later on, each series is limited to three degrees, the first of which rep­ resents the end; the second, the cause; and the third, the effect. It is beyond doubt that this development of the doctrine of discrete de­ grees, which gives Swedenborg's theology its peculiarly triadic char­ acter, flows from the system he established through the firmly structured doctrine of correspondences, of three interrelated spheres of end, cause, and effect. This analogy with the doctrine of corre­ spondences is directly indicated for the first time in the preface to De 73"

All the organisms retain their relationships, their form, and their motion thanks to the four atmospheres or auras that surround the universe: air, ether, magnetic fluid, and the highest aura, from which the jfuidum spirituosum emanates. By \"a sane instinct of rea­ son,\" Aristotle has said that the heavens had a soul, but an auxiliary one (animam assistentem) without intellect. These auras become truly alive, in the higher sense of the term, only when they flow into the microcosm (Economy of the Animal Kingdom II, §§199-200). But the life in which they then become participants is not the life of the mi­ crocosm itself, and no longer does it emanate from nature. \"Nam natura in se spectata est mortua, et modo inservit Vitae pro causa instru­ mentali\" (For nature, considered in itself, is dead, and only serves life as an instrumental cause; Economy of the Animal Kingdom II, §234). All life flows from God, the source of all wisdom, the eternal light. (Economy of the Animal Kingdom II, §238). It is through him that life and intelligence penetrate both the most rudimentary and the most perfect substances created to receive it. Consequently, life and intelli­ gence also penetrate living beings in their most perfect substance, the fluidum spirituosum, and finally, through this medium, all other things according to the degree of their perfection (Economy of the An- imal Kingdom II, §240). Analysis does not permit us to explain how this life and wisdom penetrate created substances; we can only for­ mulate a representation by comparing it with light. Swedenborg re­ calls here that, in the Bible, God is frequently compared to the sun (Economy of the Animal Kingdom II, §254). And it is here that the image of the Divinity appears compared with the spiritual sun that has been so beloved by the mystics since Plato. As the sun, in its universe, is the source of all light, likewise the Divinity is the sun of all life and of all wisdom. And as the sunlight flows into our world in a specific way without uniting with the illu­ minated things, so does the sun of life and wisdom (Economy of the Animal Kingdom II, §251). 74"

But what he says about it largely suffices to convince us that he has adopted the Neoplatonic reasoning, This line of reasoning will orient his thinking progressively to the point where we find it raised to the level of a dogma in his theological doctrine; according to this, God created the world by means of a spiritual sun, of which the natural sun constitutes only a reflection (Divine Love and Wisdom §§151-157). It is hardly worth the effort to seek the source of this Sweden­ borgian conception, which we have already seen broached in the Pro­ dromus. He could have gotten it directly from The Republic of Plato (book 6, 508) or from Plotinus; he could have borrowed it from Saint Augustine, who often paraphrased it;97 perhaps he owes it to numer­ ous other mystics, in whose writings it frequently appears. It could also have come to him from the prologue of the Gospel according to John, the text of which Swedenborg never fails to quote in support of his view of the true light that illuminates the world. It is also evident that this conception could only find nourishment in the \"supernatu­ ral\" luminous visions referred to above.98 Swedenborg's predecessor, van Helmont, who himself also con­ sidered form-creating light (lux forma lis) as the inmost essence oflife, bases his view on the fact that all who, like him, have been called to perceive the inmost foundation of life in a moment of ecstasy, have conceived it as a light.99 What is important is that Swedenborg comes thereby to accept the Neoplatonic emanation ism which, for most of the Christian mystics, constitutes, consciously or unconsciously, the basic construct to which their visions, dreams, and speculations are attached. Already in his Cia vis Hieroglyphica (§ 18), written in 1744 and posthumously published in London in 1784,100 he develops the allegory of the sun in a Neoplatonic sense, thus trying to eliminate God's role in the existence of evil in the world. No more than the sun is deprived of light when worldly objects obstruct its rays-hence, creating darkness-can God be considered as the cause of ignorance, which is merely the lack of wisdom. \"God is never deprived of wis­ dom, but the corporeal desires of the soul set themselves against the penetration of God and of his wisdom; and therefrom arises the folly 75"

Wisdom without ignorance or insanity would not appear to be wisdom, as neither would the good without evil, for there would be nothing from which it [either one or the other] could be perceived\" (CIa vis §20). We find in the doctrine of degrees and of forms, as it is ex­ pounded in Introductio ad Psychologiam Rationalem (Introduction to Rational Psychology),lOl which dates from 1740 or 1741, an interest­ ing example of the metaphysical superstructure in the Neoplatonic manner that Sweden borg erects on the mathematical structure of the world that he formulated in the Principia. Just as in this later work, he here follows the evolution of motion phenomena from the sim­ plest form, the rectilinear, to the circle, to the spiral and to the vorti­ cal, in order to arrive at the form he calls perpetuo verticalis, or heavenly, which he regards as belonging to the simple primary of nature. But while in the Economy of the Animal Kingdom (see chapter three above), he still avoids all transcendence beyond the limits of the universe, here he lets his train of thought continue. Above this form which constitutes \"pure\" motion, the highest in the universe, we find the form that Swedenborg calls perpetuo caelestis, or spiritualis (Econ­ omy of the Animal Kingdom III, §267). This form is placed above all created nature and escapes all human analysis. It is beyond all deter­ mination, and from it all things of the universe exist. And at the highest point of the scale is the form Swedenborg calls perpetuo spiri­ tualis, the inconceivable divine being, the Creator, origin and end of all things. It is in this form that everything infinite, undefinable, holy, resides. \"It flows into the forms of the angels and of the heavens and into our souls through the intermediary of the forma spiritualis and of the Word. But these are arcana, which is why it is proper to remain silent, awed, reverent, and worshipful, than to speak of it profanely, that is, in natural terms.\" From this divine, spirituality emanates; the spiritual creates the celestial; the vortical and the entire descending series flows from the celestial (Economy of the Animal Kingdom III, §268, §272).

It is needless to emphasize the entirely Neoplatonic character of this conception. From this undefinable primitive, to which, accord­ ing to Swedenborg, one cannot even give the name of form, and which thought has to conceive as abstract from all determination of time and space, of all variation or of all transformation, the entire universe issues through emanation. In the course of this process, however, this primitive being has lost none of its force and has not been the object of any transformation whatsoever. It is only by the intermediation of the spiritual form, the first sphere of divine activ­ ity, that this primitive being comes to penetrate the souls of angels and our own, created to receive from it life and intelligence just as all our bodies are created to receive motion (Economy of the Animal Kingdom III, §269). For Swedenborg, as for Plotinus, the totality of the universe is thus spiritualized. Matter is but a shadow, dead and soulless, which comes alive when penetrated by the divine light. It is not surprising that the citations borrowed from the dialogue of Plato or Aristotle's theology are more frequent here than in any other pas­ sage in his works. Just as the cosmological system of the Principia is transformed under the influence of the idea of a spiritual sun, almost without no­ tice as it were, into a purely Neoplatonic image of the universe, so the description Swedenborg gives of the human soul and its functions, in the final chapter of the second part of the Economy of the Animal Kingdom, constitutes an evolution of his prior psychological theories in a Neoplatonic manner. We recall that Swedenborg, in the Principia, expounded the tra­ ditional twofold division of the soul, comprising the vegetative soul (animus) and the reason (mens). This division is now modified: above the mens, Swedenborg places the intuitive faculty of the soul, the anima. This is nothing other than the activity of the fluidum spirituo­ sum, and can be considered as identical with it.102 The functions of the mens are located in the cerebral cortex,l03 which is the first deter­ mination of the fluidum spirituosum.

Swedenborg appears to be perfectly aware that, by locating intu­ ition in an organism other than the reason and placing it above the latter, he flies in the face of general opinion. But all experience con­ firms his opinion entirely, he says (Economy of the Animal Kingdom II, §277). We know that our soul possesses a faculty of this nature, en­ tirely apart from reason, from the fact that, in many cases, we are led towards events as though by one of the threads of the Fates. We learn about this thanks to our consciousness when remorse and anxieties emanate from principles unknown to us. And this is why we speak of happenstance, accident, and fortune. For the mind knows nothing of the way the anima governs and admonishes its empire (Economy of the Animal Kingdom II, §282). In its very essence, the anima is like­ wise unknown to us. It surpasses the intellectual mind and thereby our knowledge of the concepts and sphere of words (Economy of the Animal Kingdom II, §277). When we wish to speak of the anima, we are obliged to resort to terms and comparisons that are barely intelligible. The anima is placed very much above all the other faculties of the soul; it is their law and their organization, the very condition of their activity. It is knowledge itself, the principle of all our science. \"Unless the soul were science itself, there could be no sensation, no volition, that is, no affection. The fact that we possess a soul (anima) with more knowledge than we believe is obvious from the very na­ ture of the mind, in which a kind of highly rational philosophy and a peculiar logic evolve, as it were connate from the first beginning of our sensations, and which is perfected in proportion to the growth of our understanding\" (Economy of the Animal Kingdom II, §276). There must exist in us, then, something whose activity is knowledge itself and whose activity embraces everything. It is here that Swedenborg appeals to Locke's description of intuitive knowledge, the existence of which is beyond any doubt, which neither demands nor permits any proof, upon which rests the evidence of all the theses that are im­ posed on the human spirit as soon as they are propounded, as well as those subject to it, on which it impinges without the help of discur­ SIve reason. 78"

The anima is likewise capable of attaining knowledge of ends, at least those which fall within the proper limits of the created universe. For the anima itself belongs to created nature; it is consequently only knowledge itself, and not wisdom, the exclusive attribute of God (Economy of the Animal Kingdom II, §276.) The anima is thus the light that fashions our perception of our consciousness. It flows in the same way as the light into the mens (Economy of the Animal Kingdom II, §274). The anima has spatial extension, being contained in bodily tis­ sues, and can escape only by physical death. It also preserves the exact form of the body even after leaving it (Economy of the Animal King­ dom II, §348). To the question of whether the anima is material or incorporeal, Swedenborg replies that it participates in both states. In its quality of fluidity, organically linked with the fibers and fluid of the body, it be­ longs to matter. But its own life is an emanation from the Holy Spirit; from this point of view, it cannot be viewed as material. Everything that is substantial or derived from a substance in the created universe is subject to dimension and can therefore be considered material. But to the same extent that it has being and life, the anima shares in the uncreated, the godly, and cannot be called material. The soul is not material to the degree that it receives its being and life from the Di­ vine and cannot be called material, any more than the body can with respect to its life. It can be said, then, that the soul is at once material and imma­ terial; and, on this circumstance, materialists and nonmaterialists both can rest their opinions (Economy of the Animal Kingdom II, §311). Just like the soul itself, its functions are at once material and nonmaterial. In themselves, they are only manifestations of motion, modifications identical to those we discern in the auras, of which they are the determinants. \"All ideas, be they classified as material or non­ material,104 are, then, real essences (essentiae reales) similar to the forms and diverse modifications of the auras; but as soon as they enter into a relationship with the vital or animated (animatum) fluid in any sensory manner whatsoever, their nature manifests itself, becoming 79"

Thanks to his Neoplatonic view, Swedenborg thus continues to elude the necessity of formally setting boundaries between the spiri­ tual and material. To his mind, the body is no more than the envelope of the soul, the matter that only the mind can distinguish from form. It is this fundamental conception that, to a certain extent, allows Swedenborg, in the elaboration of his theological system, to spiritual­ ize everything corporeal and materialize everything spiritual. From the foregoing, we have already seen that he looks upon the body as the shadow image of the soul to the extent that it shares the divine life, while he believes the soul to preserve the bodily form beyond the end of earthly life. When we come to his adaptation of the doctrine of correspondences, we shall see how he conceives, in more precise fash­ ion, the relationship between sensory phenomena and spiritual real­ ity, which constitutes sensory phenomena's origin and bathes them in its light. Concerning the lower organs of consciousness, Sweden borg strictly applies the empiricism of Locke, with which he appears to have well familiarized himself. The more his empirical development is emphasized, the more he affirms that all knowledge of our reason derives from experience. In the prologue of Animal Kingdom (I,§10), he proclaims that it is not the province of man to divine true princi­ ples and deduce them from experience, but only of higher beings: spirits, angels, and of the Omniscient himself. Locke, who also stud­ ied the operations of our intellect as meticulously as anatomists scru­ tinize the human body, has definitely established that reason (mens) possesses no innate ideas. On the contrary, the mens is only tardily de­ veloped in the normal man and is lacking in infants and idiots (Econ­ omy of the Animal Kingdom II, §294). Consequently, while the lower organs of the soul only appear over a period of years and develop tardily, the individual is endowed with an anima from birth. Adam alone received his soul directly from God. Thereafter, it was propagated through the human sperm and is, consequently, a paternal inheritance; it does not come from the mother. !Os Having a common origin, it possesses the same degree of intelligence in all human beings. It can neither degenerate nor sicken. 80"

The only difference is that, in the idiot, the channel that con­ solidates the anima's relations with the mens are destroyed, while with the infant, they are not yet open. In effect, it is only from the time when the mens is developed by experience acquired through the senses-experience that has been transmitted by the animus-that it can receive the light from the anima. We are born in a complete state of ignorance, and our organs respond only gradually. From its earli­ est germ, the anima is enveloped by fibrils and filaments, isolating it­ self, so to speak, behind veils and enclosures \"as though it did not wish to touch or behold the world it has fallen into\" (Economy of the Animal Kingdom II, §298). By this psychological theory, Swedenborg believes he has adopted a middle ground between the advocates and adversaries of innate ideas. The mens possesses no innate idea, but the anima is, from the mother's womb, in possession of all its intelli­ gence, which can, nevertheless, validate itself only to the degree that the lower faculties of the soul are developed through the empirical channel. From the foregoing, we can appreciate how understanding makes its appearance in the developing individual. Sensations em­ anate from the body through the intermediation of the animus, and collide, in the center of the mens, with the divine light shed by the anima. The mens is the center of rational life as well as the life of the will, for the light in the anima is beyond the reach of the intellect. To be grasped, it must descend. But there is only one means for it to rise anew toward life itself and towards certitude. To elevate itself thus is to rise above selfhood, above its egoism, from love of fatherland to love of God (Economy of the Animal Kingdom II, §287). Swedenborg concludes this chapter, in which he deals with the elevation of the soul toward higher ends, by picturing nature as a great circle enclos­ ing an infinite variety of ever smaller circles, all of which emanate from a single and common center. Each point, in whatever circum­ ference it is found, refers to the common center, failing which it is ejected from the circle.

This does not in any way mean to say that Swedenborg would have drawn the partic­ ulars directly from Plotinus. The inspiration can well have come to him also from the Church Fathers, particularly from Augustine, whom he further invokes for his division of the soul, or from the Neoplatonists of the Renaissance and their successors. Here, to illus­ trate the interrelationship that unites all these mystico-psychological systems, I shall briefly relate van Helmont's conception of the spiri­ tuallife. 106 We recall that van Helmont distinguishes a superior soul, the mens, image of God, from the anima sensitiva, which is only its earthly envelope. His anima sensitiva has the same functions that Sweden borg ascribes to the animus and the mens collectively: that is, it includes not only the lower faculties of the soul but also the reason (ratio).107 The anima sensitiva receives its content from the senses; it is material and perishes with the body. The mens, on the contrary, is immortal and unalterable. It is not the mens, but the anima sensitiva that is affected in illness or insanity. The anima sensitiva no doubt thinks by its own faculties, but the light necessary for it to attain clarity comes from the mens, as the light from the moon is a reflection from the sun. By the very reason of its imperfection, however, it is penetrated only imper­ fectly by that light. Because all our thought is mixed with sensory im­ pressions, we can know nothing precise regarding the mens, which is beyond our sphere. But if we can free ourselves of all self-love and thereby from all activity of our own, eliminating every disturbing sense impression, we become capable of receiving the light of the mens in all its clarity. It is easy to see that a psychological system of the type that Swedenborg constructs in the Economy of the Animal Kingdom di­ vides personality into two parts: one \"internal\" and one \"external,\" which regard each other as sworn enemies. That which, coming from the anima, penetrates the mens, constitutes the internal person; that which comes to it from the animus, the external. \"Ergo homo extern us est idem ac animal; internus vero idem ac angelus\" (the external man is therefore the same as an animal, and the internal the same as an angel; Animal Kingdom VII, §166).1 08 And this dualism is further 82"

This dualism is already found in Aristotle,109 and Plotinus speaks of a double ego, a double soul, in man.lIO This discrimination between an interior and an exterior being eventually appears in most theological systems. It is evident that this dualism was not born in Swedenborg's mind exclusively under the influence of ancient psychology. It is in answer to the antagonism that he experienced in his own personality, an antagonism that grew with the years. In his mind, the natural scientist wages a life-and-death combat against the mystic. He is motivated by a burning desire to learn and is suffused with scientific ambition. It is in the hope of de­ finitively resolving the problems of spiritual life that he renounces his official functions and undertakes long journeys. But he feels in him­ self, on the other hand, a voice that warns that all his labor is fruitless and that the only thing that really matters for him to learn cannot be revealed to him on the empirical level. This knowledge is revealed only to the seeker who opens his inner being unreservedly to divine light; it is consequently as readily or even more readily accessible to the mystic dreamer. It is in vain that he seeks to establish a kind of collaboration between science and revelation, between the most in­ tense intellectual activity of the researcher and the beatific contem­ plation of the Quietist. More and more clearly a collaboration of this nature appears to him as chimerical. From this point on, we perceive in Swedenborg the inner conflict that will assume a manifestly mor­ bid tone in his Journal of Dreams for the years 1743-1744. From this point on, he is overwhelmed by the conviction that the only way to true knowledge consists of throwing aside all scientific research, with its temporal results, and choosing the anima as his sole guide, totally renouncing the will-o' -the wisp of sensory knowledge. The unfolding of the personality appears in a particularly clear fashion, in its state at birth, in the description of life and volition that Sweden borg gives in the Economy of the Animal Kingdom. In agreement with Leibniz,111 Swedenborg characterizes the will as a tendency {conatus} to act. The will, then, is a potential act, or 83"

It is with the help of this conception that Swedenborg identifies saving faith with the moral life. In a human being, the will proceeds parallel with the under­ standing (Economy of the Animal Kingdom II, §321), and Swedenborg conceived the source of a voluntary act in a manner analogous to that of knowledge. Each perception of the animus is accompanied by love (amor), which enkindles both its origin and is its very life (Animal Kingdom VII, §175). Simultaneously with divine light, divine heat­ love-streams from the anima. The mens stands at the center. The desires of the animus, the temptations of the senses, try, from below, to hinder the mens from being led by that supreme love of good that flows from the anima. Thus, there exist in us an internal personality and an exterior one, perpetually at war (Economy of the Animal King­ dom II, §321). The same combat is waged within us by God and the devil (Animal Kingdom VII, §219). In themselves, earthly instincts are in no way culpable; they be­ come harmful only to the extent that they divert our thought from heavenly things; if the mens is left helpless to control their guidance, it risks seeing its kingdom succumb to licentiousness. These instincts prevail over the impulses of the anima because they are beyond the reach of our understanding. (Economy of the Animal Kingdom II, §§323-324). The two plates of the scales are in the hands of the mens, and it is its judgment that determines every decision. And it is precisely within its faculty to affirm or deny all that enters its sphere that free will resides (Animal Kingdom VII, §158). Nevertheless it becomes extremely difficult for Swedenborg, re­ fusing, like Locke, to acknowledge practically any innate principle and considering that all knowledge derives from experience (Econ­ omy of the Animal Kingdom II, §326) to explain the possibility of this free will. It is, in effect, by the intermediation of am ores (\"loves\") em­ anating from the body and the animus that the mens has been created.

No complete and unrestricted freedom has ever existed except with Adam, the most perfect of men, such as it was before the Fall. His mens, which had not been educated through the senses and which was not subject to temptation by any other mens, drew its heat exclu­ sively from spiritual love and was a docile instrument of the anima. In like manner, the anima was the docile subject of the will of God (An­ imal Kingdom VII, §180; Rational Psychology §374). Since this intimate relationship between God and the creature, between the anima and the mens, was destroyed by the Fall, we have been deprived of all true spiritual freedom. The higher love that has its seat in the anima is, in effect, beyond the bounds of our under­ standing. All our freedom consists in the fact that the mens is free to decide what it wishes or, on the other hand, to allow itself to be borne along by lower instincts, the amores naturales (natural loves; Rational Psychology §372; Animal Kingdom VII, §178). And once we have de­ cided, we are allpwed to submit it to a sort of court of appeals before we translate it into act. \"In this respect the will seems to possess some­ thing like liberty\" (videtur hoc respectu ipsa Voluntas aliqua libertate donari; Economy of the Animal Kingdom II, §328). Our freedom, then, is, in reality, negative. It consists in freedom to sin or not to sin. And one can ask oneself why this freedom has been granted us, which led Adam to the Fall and which, even today, creates our torment and condemns us to hell (Animal Kingdom VII, §§180-181). One can reply that, in the absence of free will, no free­ dom of thought would exist, and consequently there would be no un­ derstanding. Neither men nor virtues would any longer exist, and creation would find itself incapable of attaining its ultimate goal, which is the kingdom of God, for which our earthly life is only a preparation. As long as it is a matter of higher things and of divine things, the mens is capable of willing the means and of preventing us from following the impulsions of the animus; but, in respect to the end, it must let itself be guided by the anima which, in turn, is directed by the Holy Spirit. These things are above our comprehension, and we can acquire no exact knowledge of them by way of the senses. But 85"

By ourselves, we cannot, then, direct our will toward objectives beyond our comprehension. \"We ourselves have no power to ignite this sacred fire; and scarcely to desire it with more than a wish that is not active of itself' (ex quondam voto per se non activo; Economy of the Animal Kingdom II, §330). But we can raise ourselves by degrees to­ ward these ends by freeing ourselves from forces that tend to degrade us by combating the desires of our animus, thus opening the mens to the influences of the anima, and this to the light from above, to the \"spirit of wisdom.\" God has sent the Savior to incline the scales to his side (Economy of the Animal Kingdom II, §332). If we strive to the ut­ most of our power, we perceive above us a higher power that bestows superhuman strength and thereby raises us to a higher state that re­ sembles that liberty we have lost. For there appears to exist a divine law according to which our volition evokes the will of God (Economy of the Animal Kingdom II, §331). Thus directing our love-fully aware of our impotence toward more noble ends that we only vaguely suspect-we come to realize a mystic union with the divine. For God is the spiritual essence of all things, and love constitutes the bond between him and all that is di­ vine in creation. Love consists in loving, in another person, what one wants to see become like oneself, that with which one wishes to unite, loving us in order that we become an image of him or her. That is why the ultimate source of all love resides in the love of God for his creature, and in our love of God, who rules us. We are divine and possess life and understanding only in the measure of our love of God. Our love must strive toward infinitude. That is an end we can­ not attain, our souls being finite, but God's love for us allows us to raise our own love toward this infinite (Animal Kingdom VII, §§213-214). As we see, in his theory of free will, Swedenborg is led to purely theological considerations and, in the last of the above citations (drawn from De Anima [The Soul], written c. 1741), he arrives at a mysticism tinged with pantheism.

In reality, there is hardly a point on which, in the course of his theological period, Sweden borg argues more energetically against Lutheranism than this. For its religiosity deeply tinged with morality, the declaration of the Confession of Augsburg, according to which humanity, after the Fall, is by nature blind to spiritual things and can be converted only by grace, meant the impossibility of all moral aspi­ ration (see, for example, True Christian Religion §464). Swedenborg's conception of humankind's cooperation with the work of redemption is significantly closer to certain Pelagian tendencies at the heart of Catholicism. It also has its equivalent in the doctrine of free will that the Pietists (Dippel, in particular) criticize as sharply as Swedenborg does, and on the same grounds: the orthodox negation of all free will. Nevertheless, Dippel's psychological theory of free will completely differs from that of Sweden borg, who, in defining free will in worldly matters as a faculty of denying or confirming the judgments of reason, simply reproduces Cartesian ideas. It seems to me more credible that Sweden borg came to his theory through Malebranche, who was to exercise a marked influence on him in the course of his theosophical period. This attachment to the philosophy of Malebranche is only natu­ ral. The latter, like Sweden borg, felt the influence of Platonism and of Augustine. Although an adept of the Cartesian school, Male­ branche represents, like the Platonists of the Cambridge School, a mystical reaction against the rationalism of Descartes. Sweden borg was acquainted with Malebranche, not only directly (he possessed in his library a Latin translation of Recherche de la virite), but also through John Norris's Reflection upon the Conduct of Human Lift, which recapitulates the moral theory of Malebranche. It appears from a letter by Swedenborg to Benzelius that he read this work during his sojourn in England. For Malebranche, as for Swedenborg, human freedom is a mys­ tery.II2 He found himself constrained to acknowledge it in order not to be obliged to draw from his conception of God as unique cause and unique activity of the Ulllverse the conclusion that God is 87"

He is free with re­ gard to \"les biens particuliers.\" He can decide against personal goodness, but he can also \"suspend his consent\" (suspendre son consen­ tement) to this natural tendency, which impels him against good­ ness.l13 And in this manner, from the fact that he does not restrict his love to created things but appreciates them in their true relation to God, man becomes capable of elevating imperfect desires toward the most perfect form of love of God, which consists in loving God as God loves himself.1 14 To the degree that we raise ourselves toward God, we lose our freedom, for it is the divine force that draws us up­ ward. And without the grace of God, we can persevere no further in the good. Nevertheless, without the personal contribution of self-lib­ eration from the love of created things that threatens to divert us from the love of the supreme good-without the collaboration of our will-we cannot attain divine grace. For according to the immutable order he has established, God loves his creature to the extent that the latter rises toward perfection. If we compare Malebranche's view with the thesis of Sweden­ borg described above, we perceive remarkable similarities between them. These become yet more marked in Swedenborg's theological system when it is more fully developed, for it is allied to Male­ branche's conception of the relationship between God and the world, which is strongly colored with pantheism. In the Economy of the Ani­ mal Kingdom, Sweden borg still displays some hesitation with regard to certain doctrines of the French philosopher, notably in respect to those that submit God to the law of \"immutable order.\" He writes: \"This law of his ordaining appears to be that our willing should in­ voke God's willing, and that our power (posse) should invoke his.\" And he adds that God could naturally put himself above this law at his pleasure (Economy of the Animal Kingdom II, §331). It is evident that this theory of free will and its relation to God leads Swedenborg to a conception of the process of salvation that is entirely different from that of Lutheranism.

For Swedenborg, redemptive faith is not a gift of grace that humanity receives from on high without having done anything to deserve it, but it is, in a certain sense, the result of efforts of our free will and of the morality that flows therefrom into our ac­ tivities. It is true that these efforts could not attain their goal--or even glimpse it-without God's cooperation, but the initiative comes from the individual person if God is to grant his help. In Economy of the Animal Kingdom, Swedenborg had already concluded with regard to this thesis that it is all one \"whether we say that we are judged by our faith, by our will, or by our acts.\" For every soul striving toward the Divine can do or will nothing that is not dic­ tated by his or her love of the ultimate end. \"Faith without will is faith without love, that is to say, mere knowledge and acknowledg­ ment; in fact, it is faith without life, and thus dead faith.\" And a will of this nature implies an action, a goal for its efforts. \"Thus we may know from the action itself, unless it is a pretense, whether there be faith or not, and if there be, what the faith is\" (Economy of the Animal Kingdom II, §333). Swedenborg's awareness that he is engaging in direct conflict with Lutheranism stands out very clearly in his treatise De fide et bonis operibus (Faith and Good Works, published in 1846 in Opuscula Philosophica). This works dates from around 1738 and is conse­ quently more or less contemporaneous with Economy of the Animal Kingdom. He declares here that the passage of the Epistle to the Ro­ mans, on which Luther based his doctrine of salvation by faith alone, has been falsified by him in his translation by the addition of the words \"without works.\" \"And I consider that, in this life, he has com­ mitted no greater sin than when he added these words himself' (Faith and Good Works § 10). In Faith and Good Works, Swedenborg seeks to establish the re­ lationship between faith, will, and works in more detailed fashion, but in the same sense as the passage cited above from Economy of the Animal Kingdom. According to him a truly redemptive faith is a voluntary act. It is distinguished from \"historical\" faith, mere knowledge accessible to demons themselves, which does not deserve to be called faith. True faith cannot exist without love, and true love cannot exist without will; that is, without a will to act, it is 89"

On the contrary, salvation can only be attained by a faith that is translated into works,Jides in operibus. Naturally, one can conceive of a redemptive faith in the absence of the possi­ bility of accomplishing good works. However, it is seldom that ex­ ternal obstacles should hinder us from showing our good will, and it is this good will that God takes account of. Moreover, the account of the sacrifice of Abraham and many other examples clearly attest that God himself provides us with the means to act in accordance with our faith. The distinction that Sweden borg makes here between historical faith and living faith has earlier traditions in Catholic orthodoxy. It is identical with the distinction that Swedenborg's father affirmed be­ tween \"cerebral and verbal\" faith, on the one hand, in which demons themselves were participants, and on the other, \"the faith of the heart and of works,\" which God requires of us.lIS Pietism contributed to expand still further the concept of this \"living faith.\" Spener had al­ ready professed that the love of good, and good works, is born simul­ taneously with faith--opera sunt in fide presentia-although he did not believe that good works should be accounted for in humanity with respect to salvation.1I6 Dippel goes a step farther: for him, faith is not at all a historical knowledge, but a voluntary act. To believe in Christ means to follow the Gospel in forsaking the world and its de­ sires and to live for Jesus Christ.1I7 In the elaboration of his doctrine, Swedenborg naturally felt, to a degree, the influence of Pietism, al­ though it is not possible to assert that this doctrine is directly con­ nected with that of anyone of his predecessors. It is in direct rapport with his philosophical conceptions, being the necessary consequence of his profession of free will. When we speak of \"rationalism\" in Swedenborg's system, we usually cite his doctrine of the necessity of good works for salvation as an example. This is, to a certain degree, correct. Without any doubt, it is first of all to that doctrine that Sweden borg's theology owes its pragmatic ethical stamp.

From my outline, it nevertheless appears that it is not by the ra­ tionalistic method that Swedenborg has been led to this doctrine. If he abandons the Lutheran dogma of salvation by faith alone, it is not because this dogma appears too mystical to him. Nor does his point of view derive primarily from the interest that he may have inherited from his father regarding all moral matters, in which case it would have sufficed to proclaim, like his father, the role of works of Chris­ tian benevolence and the necessity of living in conformity with their teachings without directly breaking with Luther over the conception of salvation. Contrary to the opinion of a certain number of theolo­ gians, it is hardly likely that Swedenborg was unaware of Luther's own view of the importance of good works or of the orthodox views of the seventeenth century. In the writings of Jesper Swedberg, we find numerous quotations from Luther in which he insists on the ne­ cessity of an active Christian life, which he contrasts with the \"great faith\" of his century. It is actually from a need for mysticism that Swedenborg's con­ ception of salvation sprang. He refuses to believe that the Fall could have forever and completely destroyed this relationship between the Divine and humanity, which Luther considers to be reestablished at the moment the sinner receives redeeming faith as an act of grace. No more than he accepted that the Fall of Adam could have deprived humankind of the gift of intuitive perception did Swedenborg hold that our wills were forever lost, along with their freedom in the spir­ itual domain and their aspirations toward the infinite. Just as we reach the highest degree of our knowledge when our natural under­ standing receives a ray of light from the anima, so do our purest moral aspirations rise, with the help of divine power, toward ends that we cannot suspect. Our love meets with the divine love and be­ comes part of it. Clearly, envisioned in this manner, the process of salvation as it appears to Swedenborg must take a different course from that con­ ceived by Luther. It loses its central character and becomes a process of slow rebirth, in the course of which the individual gradually rises toward divinity. From here on Swedenborg professes in De Anima 91"

There is need, however, of bringing force to bear on oneself and of the most ardent prayer and continual cultivation of that which is truly spiritual and Divine.\" In the same treatise, Sweden borg shows how humankind thus arises gradually to attain an ever more perfect state of freedom. It becomes a kind of compensation for the orthodox doctrine of order and grace. The first stage of free will consists in the fact that the mens frees itself from desires of the flesh and makes the animus its servant. At the second stage, the mens is formed by study of the Word of God and other instructive works, receiving an intellectual faith. Finally, we reach the third state by having assiduous recourse to the means of grace: frequent worship, participation in the sacra­ ments, adoration of God, and primarily in dedication to prayer. On the condition that a person gives himself to pious practices in a spirit of justice, the divine grace that inculcates faith and love in his heart never fails him. It is then that the person comes to the fourth stage, that of true free will, which implies a kind of regeneration and spiritualization of intelligence, thanks to the spiritual zeal that animates him or her. At this stage, the person rediscovers the state of the innocence of chil­ dren before their senses are awakened. The human soul forgets all that extinguishes spiritual things and expends no care upon them ex­ cept to the degree that the individual may be able to live prudently as a dutiful participant in civil life.

But we can approach it closely enough to enjoy, in our corporeal life, an internal bliss and a heaven, and to aspire to our own dissolution (Animal Kingdom VII, §§178-180).

Naturally, God in his omnipotence could have created his king­ dom directly and directly peopled the heaven of souls without having them be born and multiply on this earth. But he has created the world with the purpose of perfecting that harmony and diversity that is to reign in a heavenly realm. For, as on earth, perfection in heaven consists of the different parts forming a whole. We are consequently obliged to conceive of the same diversities among the souls of the elect in heaven as exist among people on earth. In the absence of this, individuality would no longer exist. This difference, however could reside only in the state of souls, and thus we come to envisage the kingdom of God as composed of a number of different communities in the midst of which no soul finds itself exactly in the same state of salvation (Animal Kingdom VII, §§244-245).1l8 As we see it, for Swedenborg, the human being is the center of the universe. It is for humanity that creation was brought about. And, in their turn, human beings exist only for their souls, whose ends are beyond nature and can be known only by intuition. There we have a \"society of souls in which God sees the end of creation and by which God may be regarded as the \"finisfinium\" (Economy of the Animal Kingdom II, §365). The law that provides the means of attain­ ing this end is none other than the Holy Scripture, whose teachings are never so obscure or so profound that any sincere soul that permits the spirit of God to govern it may not draw from this pure fountain, without violating any ecclesiastical discipline, the strength to serve the members of the kingdom of God scattered over the surface of the whole earth (Economy of the Animal Kingdom II, §366).

With this hope, that the ransomed of all religions will be able to unite in an active brotherhood to establish the kingdom of God on earth, independently of all confessional divergence, one may rightfully discern the influence of Pietism.

By his acceptance of the Neoplatonic no­ tion that all life in the universe is the emanation of the spiritual sun, Swedenborg was naturally led to draw another Plotinian conclusion. The formative force of matter is itself only stuff for the real form; in the intelligible world, it is a mere reflection of the archetype. That Swedenborg actually arrived at his theory of correspondences in this manner is a circumstance that appears to me to find support in a pas­ sage of The Worship and Love of God (§65), where he declares that nothing in all nature exists that does not derive its body and its form from a kind of soul, of which it is the reflection. And these souls con­ stitute ends preestablished by heaven where they have their origin. That is why earthly things necessarily accord with heavenly things, and from lower things, one should be able to infer the knowledge of higher things. Based on the quotations taken from the Theology of Aristotle by which, in the third part of Economy of the Animal Kingdom, he seeks to justify his doctrine of the degrees of forms as I discussed in chapter four, it may be deduced that Swedenborg had already been attracted to the Neoplatonic doctrine of ideas, prior to the publication of the Cia vis. In one passage, he advances the Neoplatonic doctrine of cre­ ation: \"God first created the supreme world, in which he set up, with­ out any thought, forms all pure and perfect ... and then this sensory world as its image\" (Economy of the Animal Kingdom III, §271). In an­ other passage, still referring to the Theology of Aristotle, he states fur­ ther: \"The forms of the supreme world, says Aristotle, were called by the ancients exemplaria, wherein, according to Plato, is seated the sub­ stance of things inferior\" (Economy of the Animal Kingdom III, §264). The relationship with the doctrine of correspondences appears more clearly yet in this third quotation: \"Aristotle speaks beautifully of the natura prima and of the order in which one depends on the other, 96"

Yet the most manifest proof that the doctrine of correspon­ dences owes its origin to Neoplatonism is found in a direct affirma­ tion made in the CIa vis (19ff.): \"The Egyptians, moreover, seem to have cultivated this doctrine, and to have signified these correspon­ dences by hieroglyphic characters ... whereby are expressed not only natural things but also and at the same time, spiritual things ... on which there is a whole book written by Aristotle\" (CIa vis §S3). The passage from the Theology of Aristotle to which allusion is made here is found in chapter fourteen of book fourteen, where it is said that the wise men of Egypt and Babylon succeeded, thanks to the acuity of their minds, in beholding the mysterious secrets of the higher world. Instead of writing what they had learned, they engraved in stone the images of the things they saw. These stones were preserved in the temples and served as books. They thus meant to indicate that the ac­ tivity of the intelligence has created all things as reproductions of their own forms independently of all matter. The knowledge of these signs is accessible only to rare initiates. We see, then, that according to the work cited, hieroglyphics represent not only natural phenomena but also the essence of things; for the Platonists, this is the aim of all language. 120 This exposition of Egyptian hieroglyphic science is found again in the works of Sweden borg whenever it is a matter of the history of correspon­ dences. As an example, I quote a passage in the True Christian Reli­ gion (§20S), which will show how the theory of Sweden borg agrees in the smallest detail with the exposition of the Aristotelian doctrine: The idolatries of nations in ancient times had their origin from a knowledge of correspondences because all things seen upon the earth correspond, thus not only trees but also beasts and birds of every kind, also fishes and all other things. The ancients who had a knowledge of correspondences made for themselves im­ ages which corresponded to heavenly things and were delighted with them because they signified such things as were of heaven and the church; and therefore they placed them not only in their 97"

Therefore in Egypt and elsewhere there were images of calves, oxen, serpents, as well as of boys, old men and maidens; because calves and oxen signified the affections and powers of the natural man. The attempt that Swedenborg makes throughout to relate the idolatry of ancient peoples to their knowledge of correspondences finds its complete parallel in the thesis of Plotinus, for whom all idol­ atry is understandable when one becomes aware that there exists an \"empathy\" between the idols themselves and the higher powers they represent. The same reasoning is again found, moreover, in the The­ ology of Aristotle. Thus conceived, our entire physical world is only a symbol of the spiritual world (symbolicum Mundi spiritualis; Animal Kingdom I, §232, note u). And so this poses the question of how we are to inter­ pret these symbols so that we can rise from the knowledge of natural things to that of the spiritual truths that they reflect but that, in them­ selves, are beyond our intellectual reach. Swedenborg starts from this premise: that the verbal representation of spiritual things and that of natural things share the same mystical relationship as these things themselves. In the Animal Kingdom (I, §232, note y), he says that, when we express any natural truth by the use of physical terms and when we substitute the corresponding spiritual terms for these physi­ cal terms, we bring to the surface, replacing the physical truth or physical principle, a spiritual truth or theological dogma, the appear­ ance of which no mortal could have foreseen by simple transposition of terms. It is according to this method that Swedenborg illustrates the doctrine of correspondences in the Clavis. I have already given a characteristic example of this reasoning by way of Swedenborg's comparison between the sun in our universe and the divine sun of wisdom and love. Just as the sun in the visible world is the source of all light, so God in heaven is the source of all wisdom. This is in line with his theory outlined above, according to which every natural thing has, in our own world, a spiritual corre­ spondence, a form that unites it with its heavenly correspondent.

One cannot avoid seeing the influence of the Kabbalah in this method, especially since, in his earlier manuscript notes, Sweden borg arrived at the doctrine of correspondences through an attempt at an allegorical exegesis of the Bible. It is hardly possible to distinguish what he owed to Neoplatonism from what he owes to the Kabbalah, since the latter was itself from its beginning closely related to Neopla­ tonism; moreover, this influence was emphasized among the philoso­ phers of the Renaissance who constantly mingled Neoplatonic and Kabbalistic considerations with their doctrines. So I shall confine myself to pointing out that the Kabbalah ac­ cepts the doctrine of ideas in its Neoplatonic form. Before the cre­ ation of our world, all its creatures preexisted in their true forms in the mind of God. The entire lower world is created in the image of the higher. All that exists in the higher world is translated to us as in the form of an image. All that comes within the reach of our senses, then, has a symbolic significance. The most material forms and phe­ nomena can, therefore, inform us of what is happening either in the mind of God or in the human intellect. l21 Starting with this concept, the Kabbalah arrives at the doctrine of a heavenly alphabet and of the physiognomy that is also a proof of the intimate union between the inner and the outer, between the corporeal and the spiritual. And it is precisely this physiognomy that Swedenborg refers to when he seeks to illustrate his doctrine of correspondences in Arcana Coelestia (§§2988-2989). This affiliation appears even clearer when Sweden borg is com­ pared with certain natural philosophers of the Renaissance or the natural and Kabbalistic philosophies of the seventeenth century. In general, they start from the same principle of three superimposed worlds: the \"sublunary\" world of the elements, the celestial or \"side­ real,\" and the \"supercelestial.\" These three worlds are intimately re­ lated so that everything in the lower world has its equivalent, in more perfect form, in the higher world. I have chosen a few examples from Pico della Mirandola to illustrate how his thought approaches Swedenborg's doctrine of correspondences: 99"

And this is why whoever truly wishes to interpret their images (jiguras) and to learn their alle­ gorical significance must possess the same knowledge (unless as­ sisted by the same spirit).123 By this long quotation from Pico della Mirandola, I do not mean to imply that Swedenborg was necessarily acquainted with him. It would have been as easy to confirm the concordance of the Sweden­ borgian doctrine with that of Cornelius Agrippa, who drew from the so-called Platonist his theory of concordance between the three worlds. If I have quoted Pico della Mirandola, it is because he was the first in modern times to have clearly formulated the Kabbalistic method of interpretation that was later adopted, almost unaltered, by so many exegetes and naturalist mystics; moreover, his exposition 100"

At no time has Swedenborg pretended that he invented the doc­ trine of correspondences or that he was the first to apply it. On the contrary, he always emphasized that it is a matter of knowledge for­ merly possessed by humanity and later lost progressively as it turned away from God. In True Christian Religion (§§202-206), he declares that men of \"the most ancient church,\" that is, those who lived before the Flood, \"were of a genius so heavenly that they spoke with the an­ gels of heaven and that they were able to speak with them through correspondences.\" They conceived, then, all that they saw on this earth not only in a natural way but also through the spiritual sense. This doctrine, which was expressed in acts of worship, was transmuted little by little among the Jews into idolatry and ended, under divine providence, in total oblivion. It was conserved by Enoch, however, and, thanks to him, spread into a number of coun­ tries such as Canaan, Egypt, Assyria, Chaldea, Syria, Arabia, Tyre, Sidon, and Nineveh, where it persisted and was practiced, particu­ larly among \"those who were called diviners and sages and, by some, magi.\" From these oriental countries, it was carried over into Greece, \"but there it evolved into fabulism, as it appears among the most an­ cient scribes of that country.\" This doctrine gradually fell into general oblivion everywhere and did not even reappear at the coming of Christ, which indicated that the Christians of the primitive church were so simple (simplices) that it would have been of no use to them. And after the Council of Nicea, which established the dogma of the Trinity, the world found itself invaded by such darkness that the doc­ trine of correspondences could not be revealed there. It is only thanks to Swedenborg's intervention that this doctrine and, with it, the spir­ itual sense of the Word were again revealed to the world by the grace of God. Such is Swedenborg's conviction, after he has received his re­ ligious mission. In the CIa vis, he does not yet pretend to possess the knowledge of the spiritual correspondences of all natural things.

In the brief preface of his first manuscript sketch on the correspondences, he declares that igno­ rance of the spiritual sense of a word is the cause of many controver­ sies and false interpretations to which the study of holy writ in particular gives rise. It is nevertheless evident that, from that time, Swedenborg con­ sidered the doctrine of correspondences as a secret one with ancient roots. This is notably proven in his above-cited allusion to the Egyp­ tians and in his affirmation at the end of the Clavis that the ancients knew a form of correspondences which he classified as ''fabulosa'' and which are also found in the heroic poets. It is clear that Sweden borg here alludes, as in the declaration mentioned above regarding one Greek fabulist, to the allegorical explanation given by the Stoics to the mythology and works of Homerian explanation that Swedenborg knew very well from De Rerum Natura of Cicero, which he quotes in Economy of the Animal Kingdom. As we know, this allegorical inter­ pretation of the Stoics became, by the intermediation of Philo, one of the primitive stages of the allegorical exegesis of the Bible. Turning to the naturalistic philosophers of the Kabbalah, one recognizes, in the exposition of the origins of their doctrine, all the details Swedenborg gives on the history of the doctrine of correspon­ dences. Even the Greek philosophers were accustomed to consider Egypt as the cradle of all wisdom; since the Hellenic period, tradition speaks of the treasures collected by Pythagoras, in the course of his fa­ bled voyages in Egypt and the Orient, in the form of mysterious doc­ trines that were later transmitted from generation to generation. When the Kabbalists picked up these traditions, they naturally traced the doctrines of the Greeks and their oriental mentors back to Moses or the people before the Flood. One thus had an explanation for the manifest similarity between Neoplatonism and the Kabbalah without being constrained to have recourse to the inadmissible hypothesis ac­ cording to which this Kabbalah would be a graft of Neoplatonism. It would take us too far afield to show in any detail the similar­ ity between the history that Swedenborg gives of his doctrine and that which the Kabbalists give of theirs. Like Swedenborg, the Kab­ balists attribute a certain role to Enoch in the establishment of the tradition. As transmitters they list the same people as the Swedish 102"

Like Swedenborg, they stress the fact that the three wise men from the East who worshiped the newborn Christ were called \"magi.\" Swedenborg's concepts here nevertheless diverge from those of the Kabbalists in a way that should not be overlooked. For the Kab­ balists, knowledge of the relations between the different worlds im­ plies the mastery of occult forces. Earthly things have not only the form and the character of their supercelestial or sidereal correspon­ dences, but additional occult forces that can be dealt with only by the knowledge of \"natural magic\"; the latter, in turn, must be distin­ guished from necromancy, which calls on the help of demons)24 Pico della Mirandola tries to establish in a precise manner the differences between these two doctrines. He emphatically proclaims that natural magic, like that of the Kabbalah, can only convince us of the divinity of Christ and many other theological verities. 125 Swedenborg, on the other hand, condemns all magic, even \"natural\" magic, which cannot predict what is divine but only what is against the divine (Arcana Coelestia §3698). This evidently does not prevent him from openly ac­ knowledging the possibility of this magic. In many passages of his works, he declares that magic actually comes from the abuse of corre­ spondences and that it led to the oblivion into which, by the provi­ dence of God, this doctrine fell. For Swedenborg, then, the doctrine of correspondences has value only as a key to knowledge; the gigantic effort of the Renais­ sance to dominate the aggregate of occult forces while extending this knowledge stirs no echo in him. For him, the doctrine of correspon­ dences should lead us, first of all, to a more perfect understanding of Scripture. It is exceedingly significant that already in 1741 (the year when he drafted the first outline of the doctrine of correspondences and four years before he received from God his mission and inter­ preter of the Bible), Swedenborg had assembled a number of biblical passages and sought to interpret them allegorically. He evidently found support in this from earlier attempts to dis­ cover a mystical sense in the divine Word, attempts quite common at that time not only among students of the Kabbalah but also in the most embedded ranks of orthodoxy.

It is thus clear that Swedenborg felt the influence of contemporary bibli­ cal exegesis. Solomon Glassius, who, according to Diestel,126 was the great orthodox hermeneutic authority of the time, distributed the spiritual or mystical sense of biblical text into three categories: sensus allegoricus, sensus typicus, and sensus parabolicus. 127 Glassius' explana­ tion and examples of these three categories are quite close to the doc­ trine expounded by Swedenborg, and each of these categories include, in turn, subdivisions: there is notably a special chapter \"De allegoriis fabularum. \"128 It is probably possible to trace the classifica­ tion introduced by Sweden borg in his doctrine of correspondences to Glassius or some other exegete. That, however, seems to me a rather uninteresting task, since the distinctive characters of the diverse cate­ gories do not appear to have been formulated with a very rigorous logic either by Sweden borg or by his precursors. Among the categories Sweden borg refers to there is one that nevertheless seems to me to merit some attention here: this is what he designates as \"correspondentia fabulosa et somniorum.\" According to examples he cites in this connection, it appears that he is thinking of the dreams related in the Bible such as those of Pharaoh and Joseph. These very dreams are found in a subdivision of the sensus typicus of Glassius.1 29 But it is equally certain that the personal dream Sweden­ borg had at that time had played a role in his elaboration of the doc­ trine of correspondences. From Swedenborg's later recovered Journal of Dreams, which he recorded from 1743-1744, it seems that he has symbolically interpreted all the oneiric visions to which he had been subject at the time. Everything leads us to suspect that the same ap­ plies to his preceding notes, which have been lost. Nor can one deny that part of the correspondences outlined in his CIa vis closely parallel the folkloric tradition of dream interpretation. But the significance of the correspondences does not reside merely in Swedenborg's biblical exegesis or in the symbolic interpre­ tation of his dreams.

Swedenborg had already noted in the Theology of Aristotle that every earthly being has its original image in the higher world and that this higher world consequently offers us a perfect re­ production of our own world. Just as in this one, we find there plants, streams, aquatic animals, although they are of a superior essence (De seer. parte, 1, VIII, 3). We shall see later how, for Swedenborg, the spiritual world be­ comes a duplicate of the visible world and how, during his theosoph­ ical years, he will affirm with increasing emphasis that this correspondence between the two worlds extends to the most minute details. In the two first works on the doctrine of correspondences, only one or two conclusions are found regarding the spiritual world. Thus, in the Clavis, he demonstrates the existence of \"spiritual intelli­ gences,\" of good angels and bad spirits. In the introduction of the draft manuscript, we find certain reflections on spiritual language, of which the angels make use for natural expressions, just as we recur to natural terms for spiritual phenomena. The angels are able to com­ prehend our language; they can receive a stronger impression of it to the extent that we strive to free our thoughts from material things, an effort in which we cannot entirely succeed in earthly life. The lan­ guage of angels themselves is purely spiritual and cannot be ex­ pressed in sounds deriving from the motion of the tongue, or at any rate by sounds perceptible by us. As we see, Swedenborg did not yet believe he was in conversation with angels, and his notions of spiri­ tuallanguage emerged only from his doctrine of correspondences. He found in this theory, then, the key that he believed would open to him the doors of the supersensory world. Thanks to the mys­ tical relationship between words, it henceforth becomes possible for him to see a prophetic sign behind an apparently insignificant occur­ rence and to discover in an apparently insignificant affirmation a sig­ nificant spiritual intervention. The world and its sensory phenomena will now be, for him, only the symbol of a higher life; the new verities of science are no longer significant except to the extent that they can be interpreted in a divine sense.

The world in which he wanders is a world of shadows, images, resemblances. Whoever is incapable of interpreting these symbols walks like a blind man. \"We are justified in believing,\" he writes at the end of the Clavis, \"that the whole world is filled with types (typi) but that we know very few of them\" (CIa vis §67). It is to the clarification of these types that he is hereafter to consecrate his life. The unfortunately all too brief review that I have given of the contents of Economy of the Animal Kingdom and the other works from the same period should make it clear to the reader that we can find in these works, in nuce, Swedenborg's whole theological system. In these treatises, whose plan is of purely natural-scientific and mainly physiological concern (replete with details I have no reason to examine here), Swedenborg has developed not only his philosophical ideas but also a complete system of theology that lacks only the certi­ tude vouchsafed by divine inspiration to turn into religious preach­ ing.

Peculiarly, it has survived much longer outside Swedenborgian circles than in these circles themselves.

I have already shown how this manner of thinking is subject to the error of entirely overlooking the dominant spirit of the time in the natural sciences, particularly in medicine. All in all, it does not appear that the philosophy of the Economy of the Animal Kingdom has been accorded its rightful stature among Sweden borg's published studies. In a large number of biographies, even those that are otherwise quite complete, this work is entirely neglected or simply attached to the Principia. This is notably the case with Hans Schlieper's exposition of Swedenborg's philosophy, which is also highly unsatisfactory.13o Swedenborgian authors, such as Rudolph Tafel, J. J. G.

Stroh, for example, have, on the other hand, established that, in Economy of the Animal Kingdom, Swedenborg gives a glimpse of certain aspects of his later system; but, for understandable reasons, these are held to be indica­ tions of details. Thus, despite all the research to which Swedenborg has been subjected, no one has come to the conclusion that, in its essential lines, the whole system of Sweden borg was already elaborated, not merely prior to his visionary period proper but even before the religious cri­ sis to which his Journal of Dreams testifies, and which found its poetic expression in The Worship and Love of God. And this applies just as well to theological theses as to his scientific and philosophical concep­ tions. It can be stated without exaggeration that, during his theosoph­ ical period, Sweden borg does no more than develop his system and draw from the structure of his earlier thought the conclusions im­ posed by logic.

Their doctrines demand to be believed in order to be understood, and only the reader who resolutely suspends his mental processes and delivers himself up to his pure imagination has some chance of assimilating them.

Swedenborg's strangely logical construct can only be explained by the fact that his system was elaborated, in its essential lines, before the author's missionary period. It has been developed by a mechani­ cian accustomed to abstract structures, by a scientist who held, even after his conversion to theosophy, to the necessity of exact methods. When impelled later by the same internal necessity that had caused him to abandon the mechanistic philosophy of the Principia for the mysticism of the Economy of the Animal Kingdom, he becomes the vi­ sionary and exegete. The fundamental doctrines of this system have taken root in his mind to the extent that he involuntarily reproduces them in his dreams and visions. We shall see later that Swedenborg's entire philosophical conceptions are again found in the visions de­ scribed in his Journal of Dreams; accordingly, his apparitions are al­ ways related directly to his philosophical theories. In his Spiritual Diary, he notes day by day the spiritual phenomena of which he is the object with the same scrupulous exactitude that he has previously ap­ plied to his scientific observations. He accepts nothing that cannot be incorporated into his grand system. Thus, his biblical exegesis is for him only a means of providing divine authority for his previous the­ ses.

Swedenborg's philosophy has, in common with these diverse movements and their ramifications, what constitutes a reaction, tinged with theology, against the materialistic conclusions the natural sciences threatened to impose. It also has a close dependence on the Neoplatonism that Swedenborg was familiar with, not only by direct study, but also through the Church Fathers and Renaissance philosophy. What distinguishes the philosophy of Economy of the Animal Kingdom most clearly from the Principia is that, under the influence of Aristotle, Plotinus, Leibniz, and also of modern science, the mech­ anistic conception gives way to a clearly organic one. Nature is a sys­ tem of ends that mutually condition each other; it is a living organism whose development is best explained by the analogies offered by the human anatomy. We already see dawning in Swedenborg's mind the representation of the universe as \"the grand man,\" an idea he found in various places in the ancient philosophy and which he is to apply later in an entirely paradoxical fashion. This organic conception of nature is translated in his scientific mind by his systematic application of the doctrine according to which all that exists in the macrocosm is reflected in the microcosm. Not only humanity, but even the most minute particle of the universe constitutes a world in miniature, pre­ senting the same organic structure and subject to the same laws as the macrocosm. For Swedenborg, the theory of series and degrees serves above all to illustrate the organic interconnectedness of everything in nature. A consequence of this doctrine, connected with the specifically theological conception of Economy of the Animal Kingdom, is the idea that every being carries within itself the germ of its entire ulterior evolution and that in this germ, in potential form, are found not only the forces to which it will give actual existence later on but also the ends that are its mission to realize. Such is the meaning of the doc­ trine of avis formatrix that exists in every creature. Finally, the theory of correspondences permits us to penetrate the spiritual world of which our own world is but a reflection. These are the bonds of continuity and analogy uniting the most humble things with the most exalted, which, for Sweden borg, 110"

Philosophy is the spider at the center of the web, sensing the slightest of motions, however peripheral they might be. In his imagi­ nation, the great natural mechanism had already made way for the great organism of nature; but the goal of his philosophy continued no less to be the discovery of the threads, tenuous and almost invisible, that form the immense tissue of creation. With Sweden borg, the idea that regulates this cosmic network is, as we have already indicated, of an emanatory nature. Like his predecessors among the Church Fathers or the Renaissance Platon­ ists, Swedenborg does not give voice to any systematized emanation­ istic doctrine. He notably declares that creation is a free act of God. But he conceives of every phenomenon, of each life in the bosom of the universe, as the result of a continuing emanation of divine energy. To make plain the fact that this emanation does not in the least di­ minish the energy inherent in God and that this energy is not the ob­ ject of any substantial union with created things, he always returns, like Plotinus, to the allegory of the sun, which irradiates the universe across the celestial spaces without losing any of its own light and without engaging in any material union with the objects illuminated. This comparison of divinity to the sun, which is at first a simile to concretize a phenomenon of which Swedenborg has no exact no­ tion and which he considers beyond human comprehension, little by little becomes, as often happens with mystics, an entirely dogmatic thesis. In accordance with his cosmological conception in the Prin­ cipia, Swedenborg proclaims that our universe was created by God from the natural sun. But things thus created are inert in themselves; they are only vessels destined to receive the love and wisdom that penetrates them with the light of the spiritual sun. To be sure, in this precise and complete form, this doctrine is found only in Swedenborg's theological works. During his scientific period, he did not find time to formulate the doctrina infiuxuum that he had promised in the foreword to Animal Kingdom. But it is already found in draft form in works dating from that period. It is the dawn of what one sees in the theory of correspondences, in the idea of de­ grees proceeding downward from above, from perfect to imperfect to 111"

One corollary of the theory of the sun as the source of life and wisdom clearly should have led Swedenborg to deny to human be­ ings any possibility of acting and achieving knowledge by our own efforts. Our thoughts and our acts belong to us no more than the sun's rays belong to the objects it illumines. It is obvious that Sweden­ borg does not dare to venture that far. On the one hand, he brings out, when he compares God to the sun, that he may by his spirit be essentially united with humankind as he was with Adam before the Fall (Economy of the Animal Kingdom II, §2S8). On the other hand, his empirical conception of the origin of consciousness, along with the fact that he maintains the freedom of the will, obliges him to seek a compromise. He is thus led to posit, above our ordinary spiritual life, an intermediary of the divine light, the anima, which, without possessing activity of its own, is enlightened by God and guided by his will. All our conscious acts should, then, tend to permit, through the anima, the penetration of the lower regions of our soul. This pen­ etration evidently becomes possible if we reject all the influences and the seductions of the world that obstruct the light emanating from the anima. It is then a matter of a purely negative mission; pushed to its extreme consequences, it concludes in nothing less than the anni­ hilation of our own personality, of our \"external man,\" to use the ex­ pression of Swedenborg; in a word, \"to the state of infancy before the awakening of the senses.\" In this state, the human being exclusively becomes the receptacle of divine light. It is in this tendency toward effacement of the personality that the mystic character of Swedenborg becomes more and more evident in the works of this period. It is precisely this tendency that prevents him from adhering to the Lutheran doctrine of faith and salvation. For Luther, our spiritual freedom begins at the instant, by divine grace, we accept redeeming faith. For Swedenborg, on the contrary, as for most of the mystics, salvation consists precisely in the final alienation of our free will after a long period of ascetic self-education. We are to use our freedom to lose this free will step by step, to make of ourselves an instrument of divine activity. We shall see further that 112"

Before embarking upon the study of this period, when Sweden­ borg experiences true vision for the first time and lays the foundation for his theory of spirits, I want to call the reader's attention to certain passages of his previous works in which he delivers himself up to speculations on the future life and describes certain mystic states of the soul. In my exposition of Swedenborg's philosophical conceptions, I have already referred to some passages in his works dating from his scientific period in which he reasons about the nature of spirits, their various modes of apparition, and the division of the heavens into a number of communities within which no soul enjoys exactly the same happiness as the others. In a chapter of De Anima that deals with destinies of the soul after death, we find a more complete expo­ sition of these questions and some other related ones. It is well to recall that Sweden borg does not yet consider himself as possessing more complete knowledge than others about life after death. At every turn, he invokes the Bible, the doctrines of the Church Fathers, the intuitions of those sages of paganism Pythagoras, Socrates, and Plato regarding the existence of a future life and dwells on the analogies that can be deduced from earthly conditions. He even describes these speculations as baseless fantasies that will per­ haps appear ridiculous to him when he enters the future life. Never­ theless, they hold for us a real interest because they allow us to deduce the image Sweden borg had of the future life before his vi­ sionary period. In a general way, they harmonize with prevalent Christian notions. However, we already glimpse a certain number of personal traits that foreshadow Swedenborg's later eschatology. We recall that, for Swedenborg, it is the anima alone that sur­ vives the body. The lower strata of the soul enjoy no immortality. The proofs he advances for the immortality of the anima are percep­ tibly identical to those we learn about through De Infinito. Endowed with a form superior to that of natural things, the anima may not be destroyed by these. For a time after bodily death, it continues on in a somber state of existence, devoid of intelligence; in fact, it cannot abandon the body until the latter has disintegrated, and it can thus 113"

It is an interesting carryover, for it demonstrates to what extent he remains convinced of his no­ tions of the materiality of the soul. He finds there, among others, a confirmation in the fact that, in some cases, seamen have returned to life several days after they were believed to have drowned. During this interval, the anima possesses the same life as during the fetal pe­ riod, and it is only from the moment that it finds itself freed from the body that it resumes an entirely individual life (Animal Kingdom VII, §§234-236). Just as in his earlier works, Swedenborg seeks here to learn how the dispersed components of spiritual substance come together again after death. He believes that this reunion is perhaps due to the inner empathy that allies them. As proof of this hypothesis, he cites analo­ gies drawn from nature. It is well known, he says, that bushes, plants, or flowers, when reduced to dust, are reborn when immersed in water. If, then, the various parts of these lower things are capable of renewal, how much more reason there must be for the same to apply to the substances of the soul? Swedenborg returns to the example used by his father to prove the resurrection (see chapter one). It is said that ghosts, after the last rites, can appear before their friends, which would be impossible if the vital spirits were not joined one with an­ other and could not be brought together again. This reconstitution of the bonds that join spiritual substances finds new confirmation in pa­ ternal love; this love has its source in the father's sense that the off­ spring has been drawn from his own soul and that it consequently tends to rejoin it (Animal Kingdom VII, §237). It might be feared that, under such conditions, one soul might be confused with another. Swedenborg believes, nevertheless, that di­ vine providence has arranged everything so that no soul is ever ab­ solutely identical to another (Animal Kingdom VII, 238). One soul is distinguished from all others by the degree of wisdom it has attained. This is developed during the earthly life in one direction or another and after physical death is not susceptible to mutation in its individ­ ual essence (Animal Kingdom VII, §§241-242}.13l To the question of knowing in what manner the soul becomes an angel when it enters into the celestial life, Sweden borg replies that, for his part, he does 114"

It is also possible that we shall assume, in the heavenly life, hot the imperfect corporeal form but a heavenly one (Animal Kingdom VII, §238). Souls know about the present and the past through a permanent sense of intu­ ition; without the help of sense organs, they perceive everything that happens on earth as well as in heaven. They can communicate in the language of angels who, in a single thought, express what would re­ quire thousands of words and material ideas in the language of the world (Animal Kingdom VII, §247).132 In another passage (Animal Kingdom VII, §9Sff.), Swedenborg proposes the hypothesis that marriages, happy or unhappy, persist after death, the former as heavenly recompense and the latter as in­ fernal punishment. Here we find a rough draft of his later doctrine on spiritual marriage. Thus it is that souls live in heaven a life fully consecrated to the love of him who is life itself, in respect to which earthly life is but a shadow and a dream (Animal Kingdom VII, §247). As for Sweden borg's conception of hell, this still appears to me, in its general lines, to conform with the orthodox one, as is his description of the Last Judgment (Animal Kingdom VII, §§248-249). It is evident that Swedenborg has not yet arrived at the concrete views that he adopts later about the body of the angels and about the functions of this body. These hosts of the spiritual world acquire a corporeal real­ ity only little by little in the course of his theosophical period. This does not diminish Sweden borg's disposition to acknowl­ edge from now on the possibility that the souls of the dead can appear to us in visible form. He supports the belief that, from the moment it is freed from the body, the soul has the faculty of assuming any form it pleases, so that \"if it descends to earth it can take on the human form momentarily.\" For the whole of nature was created to serve as an instrument of the spiritual life. Just as, in the course of earthly life, the body executes the orders that reach it from the soul and, likewise, during uterine life, thoughts of the mother can be transmitted to the infant in the form of birthmarks, so it must be admitted that in the heavens a soul possesses the faculty of assuming any human or animal form whatsoever by a simple act of will. For the soul in the heavenly environment is entirely free in its decisions, and its free will is no 115"

All these determinations seated in the soul after the end of earthly life nevertheless depend on its active and spiritual princi­ ple; in consequence, they can only serve necessary ends. In fact, it would be inadmissible that these determinations should be the result of a feeling of pure curiosity or a desire for novelty, since these instru­ ments belong only to the mens and the animus (Animal Kingdom VII, §240). From this time on, then, Swedenborg appears convinced that the souls of the dead can appear to the living under diverse forms and can exercise a certain influence upon them. But nothing in his exposi­ tion of the matter indicates that he considers himself to have experi­ enced an apparition of that nature. However, one clearly sees the interest he shows in the topic. It can be easily foreseen that, in the day when he himself will be the object of visions, he will entertain no doubt of their reality. One comes to the same conclusion when reading Sweden borg's exposition of the \"Diseases of the Fiber\" in the third part of the Econ­ omy of the Animal Kingdom. Here it is a matter of various maladies of the soul and supernatural states of the soul. This passage holds a spe­ cial interest when one seeks to comprehend the terminology of the Journal of Dreams and the Spiritual Diary, and it is strange that none of the psychiatrists who have undertaken to elucidate the nature of mental illness which they have suspected in Swedenborg has studied in detail his own theories on the diverse maladies of the soul and their symptomatology. My own interest is here focused on the views Swedenborg had at that time of the specifically mystical states of the soul as well as his explanation of them. First of all, it is notable that to Swedenborg these psychic states constitute real diseases that are due in large part to states of physical weakness. He generally connects them with features of his psycho­ logical system. Most often he considers them to be provoked by a splitting of an external personality from an internal personality. Thus, in somnambulism (noctambulatio), the external personality wanders about like a machine, while the internal personality is submerged in deep rest (Economy of the Animal Kingdom III, §531). 116"

The soul separates itself from the corporeal body while it is still alive and one can believe that the soul (anima) has escaped from the body or that, at least, though admitting that it remains associ­ ated with its body, all relations between them have been inter­ rupted. Certain individuals enter into ecstasy at the moment of agony and their soul is, so to speak, exalted above the world, but returns to its home, or its prison .... In northern regions certain persons skilled in the art of magic are credited with being able to fall spontaneously into a kind of ecstasy, in which they are de­ prived of the external senses and of all motion, and with being engaged meanwhile in the operations of the soul alone, in order that after resuscitation they may reveal thefts and declare de­ sired secrets. (Economy of the Animal Kingdom III, §537) At the end of the same chapter, Sweden borg repeats that there is nothing contrary to reason in believing that certain individuals are capable of entering into ecstasy; belief in magic has its origin in just this circumstance. Among the external symptoms of ecstasy, he notes the suspension of respiration. As we see, Sweden borg considers ecstasy to be a lethargic state of the body and of the lower faculties of the soul in which the anima, in consequence, enjoys a supernatural illumination. This is the expla­ nation he later gives of his own ecstasies, and it is beyond doubt that he thus interprets his former deliquia, accompanied by suspension of respiration and interior light. Nevertheless, in this chapter, he gives no indication that he has himself experienced such ecstatic states. On the other hand, it appears that his descriptions of hallucina­ tions contain an implicit avowal of this nature. The phenomenon he describes under the title \"Imaginatio Fanatica,\" and to which he dedi­ cates a whole chapter, clearly appears to his mind to be nothing else than hallucination, properly speaking. He characterizes this phenom­ enon as a sort of inner vision coinciding with a weakening and at times a complete suppression of ocular sight. He subdivides it into \"hemeralopia\" and \"nyctalopia,\" according to whether it has been pro­ duced by day or by night.133 117"

And he especially emphasizes that case when thoughts are jumbled and the mind finds itself projected into a flood of light surrounded by darkness. Such is the case espe­ cially with persons who strive to meditate (contemplari) on the state of the soul after physical death, \"that is, when intellectual faith stud­ ies to attribute the greatest part to itself' (Economy of the Animal Kingdom III, §S26). It is hardly possible that, in giving such detailed examples of this phenomenon, Sweden borg had in mind any other personality than his own. The question of the destinies of souls after death of the body was indeed one of those which he set himself the task of resolving: it was the problem whose definitive solution the Animal Kingdom was to provide. He may have wished it to be understood, in the quoted passage, that this problem is of such an exalted nature that to try to resolve it by the sole force of reason (see chapter three regarding his conception ofjides intellectualis) involved great risk of succumbing to overwork and becoming the victim of fallacious visions. From the above exposition, then, it appears that Swedenborg had already at that time experienced hallucinatory states. But he re­ mained undecided about how he should interpret these hallucina­ tions: are they divine indications, revelations of new truths, or are they misleading lights, mental disturbances representing chastise­ ment of the researcher who has ventured to pierce the veils provi­ dence had intended to keep closed? A reading of the speculative passages of Animal Kingdom, writ­ ten just before the critical period revealed in the Journal of Dreams, leaves the same impression. The serene certitude, proclaimed in the first parts of Economy of the Animal Kingdom regarding the divine in­ spiration of his theory, the nature of the soul, and the consequent cer­ tain truth of that theory, has completely vanished. In the prologue (§19), he reproaches himself for having undertaken too hastily, drawn by this ardent thirst for knowledge (ardor sciendi) a descrip­ tion of the soul after having merely studied the blood and its circula­ tory system.

In reality, in Animal Kingdom, he underscores more insistently than ever the necessity of the analytical method, the only avenue ac­ cessible to the human creature. It is reserved to superior beings, an­ gels, and to the Omniscient himself to investigate the true principles with the help of mens alone, and to draw the consequences therefrom (Animal Kingdom I, prologue, § 10). Swedenborg claims to be the first to have resorted, in a systematic fashion, to the analytic method to ex­ plain the very essence of the soul (Animal Kingdom I, prologue, §IS). Even though one has arrived at the principles of things by a similar analysis and can begin making deductions, the truths arrived at are, nevertheless, blended with ignorance and shadows, and are only illu­ sions of the truth (Veritatum simulachra). For as long as the mens is united with the body, it can never be free of the deception of the senses (Animal Kingdom I, prologue, § 13). He complains that we are so infatuated with ourselves that we consider ourselves as moving, not on the periphery, but at the center, not on earth but on the heights, not in darkness and error but in the rays of the most brilliant light and in heaven itself (Animal Kingdom I, prologue, § 1 0). In the epilogue of the second part of Animal Kingdom, written during his visionary period,134 Swedenborg seems to indicate still more clearly that the luminous visions, to which he had hitherto directed his research, are perhaps will-o'-the-wisps. In effect, he de­ clares (Animal Kingdom II, §401) that corporeal ideas are accompa­ nied by phosphorescent fires deprived of energy (fatui quidam ignes et quasi phosphori) but which fallaciously represent themselves as the very light of life. Such are the fires of the body, the animus, and the mens. Without doubt, Sweden borg remains faithful to the main lines of the psychological system we came to know in the Economy of the Animal Kingdom. But the intuition which, under the influence of Locke, he receives into the system becomes more and more a superior form of sentiment and no longer only superior reasoning. In a word, 119"

Plato used frequently to say, as the philosopher tells it, that when his soul was in a state of contemplation, he seemed to enjoy the supreme good and incredible delight; that he felt himself petrified in ad­ miration, he participated in the higher world and, inundated by a dazzling light, felt assured of immortal life; his intelligence, fa­ tigued by that contemplation, ended, nevertheless, by falling back into pure imagination, and he felt himself, when that light was again lacking, overcome by sadness. When he again sepa­ rated himself from his body to return to the light, his soul seemed to him inundated with clarity, and this state reacted upon the body. And Plato says elsewhere: the soul rises as though freed from the body and clarifies itself; when it descends once more it becomes obscure again, to rise anew after becoming purified.

The above citation attributed to Plato is extracted from the so­ called Theology of Aristotle and, in reality, constitutes only a reproduc­ tion of Plotinus' description in the Enneads of the ascension of the \"I\" towards the ideal world.135 The fact that here Swedenborg likens the highest form of awareness to mystic ecstasy in its classical sense shows more clearly than any other argument the interior evolution that takes place in his thought during the course of the few years that had passed since he wrote the first chapters of the Economy of the Animal Kingdom. 120"

He realizes that whosoever succeeds in learning these high truths by faith alone with­ out the use of intelligence is to be considered the happiest of mortals. He should abstain from reading Swedenborg's book and from seek­ ing to understand these things by his intelligence alone. There is no need to talk of light when one has vision (Animal Kingdom I, pro­ logue, §§21-22).

It is easy to read between the lines that Swedenborg does not yet venture to include himself among those privileged mortals who are capable of learning the highest truths by faith alone.

Guyon in her fine psychological study, Les Torrents, look upon this period as one of purification. The ecstasy of the first stage is not suffi­ ciently pure. The subject enjoys and is proud of the grace vouchsafed and forgets his own weakness; he lives in a state of \"gourmandise spir­ ituelle.\" The second stage consequently becomes a time of ordeal dur­ ing which God lets the soul feel the humility of its condition, leaving it to struggle against temptations and to aspire to the divine grace it believes it has lost. This state, characterized by physical suffering, is a progressive downward spiral. The ego is annihilated: all personal traits are effaced. This is what Mme. Guyon calls \"fa mort mystique.\" The soul no longer lives its own life; it is God who lives and moves within it. In general, it is precisely this second stage of mystical evolution that is rife with pathological manifestations. Drained by privations and penitences, frequently passing from the deepest despondency to a state of ecstatic bliss with a touch of megalomania, the subject ex­ hibits symptoms that psychiatrists know too well not to be tempted to identify with their own clinical observations.

He finds it warranted in many cases relating to inferior mystics, so to speak, whose celebrity rests exclusively on their success in crystallizing their symptoms around a religious idea. But it is not the same thing with respect to the great figures of mysticism. It is true that great mystics, almost without exception, have displayed symptoms characterized as neurotic; in certain cases, their mysticism is related to the neurosis by which they are afflicted. But behind these morbid phenomena, one observes magnificent intuitions and a kind of homogeneous impulse that guides their lives. \"For were there not a distinct mental state underlying the neuroses there would be no artistic genius any more than religious genius.\"137 It seems to me evident that the period in the life of Swedenborg (with which we are acquainted through the strange journal published by Gustaf Klemming under the title Swedenborg's Drommar, reviews step by step the state of depression seen in mystical development. 138 Until now the mystic apparitions of which Swedenborg has been the object have brought him only joy. Thereafter, even in full ecstasy, he suffers an affliction he attributes to his unworthiness. For the first time, he discovers \"that one can be a prey to spiritual suffering even though certain in his mind of having achieved the remission of his sins.\" He feels selfhood to be deeply rooted in his being; therefore, from time to time, he despairs of divine grace (Tafel II, Doc. 209, 60). He strives to free himself from earthly desires, and when temptations threaten to triumph, he submits to penances. He entreats God for the grace \"to belong to you and not be left to myself.\" And little by little, he feels himself freed from his own selfhood to become \"the instru­ ment to be used by God at his pleasure\" (Tafel II, Doc. 209, 54). From this journal, it also appears very clearly that Swedenborg has not been free of the neuropathological symptoms that most mys­ tics experience during this period.

They were not based on the rationalistic view that any man who believes himself in com­ munication with the supersensory world must necessarily be men­ tally imbalanced. I am not competent to pronounce on the nature of the hypersensitivity Sweden borg had acquired at that time and shall only revert to this in the following pages to the extent that it is perti­ nent in explaining his mystical state. The first pages of his journal merely contain commonplace travel notations. In the spring of 1743, Swedenborg had obtained a two-year leave of absence from his functions as assessor in order to finish the Animal Kingdom and have it printed abroad. In rapid se­ quence, he describes his voyage via Stralsund, Hamburg, and Bre­ men to Holland, where he seems to have spent the closing months of the year. Here the journal presents a hiatus; the pages following the final notes on August 20, 1743, have been torn out. When he resumes his jottings, apparently in December 1743, they are of an entirely different character. Now they are dedicated to his dreams, the beginning of which certainly goes back to a month or two earlier. Tafel139 calls attention to the fact that in the notes of April 17-18, 1744, Swedenborg says he has had \"with God's grace a preternatural sleep\" and this has been the case for an entire half year. This traces the beginning of his critical dream period back to October 1743. It is clear that this \"preternatural sleep\" was accompanied by dreams relating to his scientific works. We have noted that already in 1736, on the occasion of the intense labor required by the definitive edition of the Economy of the Animal Kingdom, Swedenborg had ex­ perienced similar dreams and ecstatic luminous sensations in which he saw a divine confirmation of the theories he was about to ex­ pound. Here too it appears that concentrated intellectual labor may have awakened his former predispositions. Later, when he interprets his dreams in the journal, he will frequently seek to relate them to the chapter that he is currently in the course of writing in Animal Kingdom. And in the Spiritual Diary, he relates also (§2951)140 that \"before my mind was opened, so that I could speak with spirits, and so be persuaded by living experience; for many years previous, ... not 125"

Sweden borg feels that a radical change has been produced in him, the cause of which he is not entirely able to explain. In his notes of December 8 (Journal of Dreams § 12), he writes that he \"wondered at myself for having nothing left to do for my own honor, so that I was even touched. Also at not being at all in­ clined towards the sex, as I had previously been all my life.\" Three days later, he summarizes the changes of which he conceives himself the object: How, after I arrived at The Hague, that my interest, and self love in my work, had passed away; at which I wondered. How the inclination to the other sex so suddenly ceased, which had been my strongest passion. How I had, during the whole time, the best sleep at nights, which was more than kind. How my trances were, before and after sleep. My clear thoughts about things. Here we have all we know of the crises that preceded the date of these notes. Although scanty, this material nonetheless suffices to es­ tablish a general concordance of the phenomena noted by Sweden­ borg with the symptoms usually observed at the onset of religious conversions. William James, who deals with an abundance of psycho­ logical material, has underscored, as characteristics of these crises, the fact that the individual suddenly feels, without conscious effort, that he is transformed and freed from the temptation that previously as­ sailed him. \"Such a rapid liberation,\" he says, \"from old tendencies and dispositions recalls with such fidelity the authentications which have been established on the results of hypnotic suggestion that one cannot help thinking that subconscious influences playas decisive a role in the brusque changes of character as in hypnotism.\"141 Among the examples of this phenomena that James cites, there is reason to note the case in which individuals of marked erotic temperament feel instantly delivered from all sexual temptations. 126"

      "text": "THE RELIGIOUS CRISIS One may ask oneself, then, what psychological factors provoked this character metamorphosis in Sweden borg. I do not believe that one runs a great risk of error in acknowledging that these factors are closely related to his scientific output. The attention awakened abroad by the works of Swedenborg has quite naturally given him a fully justified awareness of his own worth. This feeling is further en­ hanced by the thought of the great work he proposes to draw up in its definitive form and for which he has accumulated rich material dur­ ing the last decades in his anatomical researches. This work should, to his mind, permit him to acquire a sure knowledge of the life of the soul during its stay in the body and of its destiny after physical death. The exalted idea that he entertains of this work is shown in the su­ percilious terms in which he demands a leave from the Board of Mines and in which he declares in the preface of Animal Kingdom that he is the first to have the audacity to seek to acquire knowledge of the soul by this means. On the other hand, however, he is clearly aware that it is not by his own strength that he has achieved this result. At every step taken in his field of research, he feels the need for a sign of divine confirma­ tion. It is to these luminous visions, accompanied by suspension of respiration and loss of consciousness, that he attributes what he calls his \"clear thoughts.\" But it is not enough to desire this divine confir­ mation. Now and then he even has the very distinct feeling that the more strongly he insists on God's help the more it escapes him. It is this feeling he expresses in his notes on the tenth of December: How I opposed myself to the Spirit; And how I then enjoyed this, but afterwards found that it was nonsense, without life and coherence; And that, consequently, a great deal of what I had written, in proportion as I had denied the power of the Spirit, was of that description; and, indeed, that thus all the faults are my own, but the truths are not. Sometimes, indeed, I became impatient and thought I would rebel, if all did not progress with the ease I desired, after I no longer did anything for my own sake. I found my unwor­ thiness less, and gave thanks for the grace.142 127"

      "text": "EMAMUEL SWEDENBORG: THE DEVELOPMENT OF HIS THOUGHT And on the following day he tells how, on having opposed \"the power of the Holy Spirit,\" he saw \"hideous specters ... without life.\" It is not difficult to see the spiritual conflict concealed in these incoherent notes. It is the same kind of conflict that we recognize in almost all Christian mystics, torn between their urgent need for activ­ ity and the passivity that is the necessary condition for receiving di­ vine grace. Since Swedenborg's researches sought the glorification of God, it sometimes seems to him cruel to have to wait so long for the solution of enigmas he has undertaken to unravel. And in his impa­ tience, he seeks from time to time to take the lead and attain to truth without the help of divine light. But these attempts unfailingly end in his humiliation, and he is forced to acknowledge his error. Why has the Divine abandoned him in this way? Undoubtedly it is because his soul is not yet sufficiently purified, is not yet free enough from earthly desires and the vanity of a man of science. \"The power of the Spirit\" can only come down into a vessel completely cleansed of all filth so that it can be completely filled by this power. Like most mystics, Swedenborg awaits this purification by a divine miracle, by a sudden gift of grace. In his journal, we constantly see him assuring himself that he has finally triumphed over his \"external being.\" But time and again, the temptations of the senses and the vanity of the scientist renew their unceasing assaults, and he endlessly finds himself again the prey of despair and deprived of divine grace. Before entering upon the various phases of Swedenborg's inner development as they appear to us in his Journal a/Dreams, I shall say a few words regarding the forms of mystic phenomena to be found there. Without a brief study of these features, the quotations that I shall include from Swedenborg's journal would risk remaining rather obscure. Unfortunately, Swedenborg's own descriptions of his apparitions are by no means clear, and I am obliged to beg in advance to be excused for the errors that might insinuate themselves into my exegeSIS. There is no need here to explain the nature of the apparitions that Swedenborg himself classifies as dreams. He consistently regards them as symbolic; they have been sent by God to help him in his sci­ entific works, to point out the way to follow and to let him know what the future holds for him. In general, he tries to interpret them 128"

At times, nevertheless, his methods remain unworkable, and he must acknowledge that he has not yet penetrated the intentions of God, for there are \"representa­ tions, of which as yet 1 understand very little\" (Journal of Dreams §17S). Certain visions that Sweden borg claims to have had are very close to dreams as when he reports that he has \"been neither asleep nor awake, in a strange trance (Journal of Dreams §174). This state seems to leave him a degree of consciousness. \"I knew everything that 1 dreamed and my thoughts remained captive,\" he says in the same passage. The visions discussed here appear to agree in their main lines with the experiences that are purely oneiric; nevertheless, to a certain extent, they seem to exercise a more marked influence on his mind. Apparently, as Herrlin indicates,143 it is a kind of hypnagogic hallucination, a common type of vision even in normal mental states. On the other hand, the apparitions that Swedenborg himself classifies as visions also seem to occur in a state of wakefulness. What is char­ acteristic is that they take place almost exclusively immediately be­ fore or after the state of torpor. The particular receptivity of these two periods to hallucinatory phenomena is considered to be one of the most frequent initial signs of mental disturbance. Among these hallucinations, some are of a more elementary na­ ture. It is thus that Swedenborg sees \"gold,\" or on another occasion, the vision is \"of a coal fire, burning strongly\" (Journal of Dreams 261). It is evident that photisms, the first mystic manifestations of which he is the object, belong in the same category as visions. Certain expres­ sions in the journal clearly indicate that Swedenborg continues to have visions of this nature from time to time, and under conditions perceptibly identical. Notably when he says (Journal of Dreams §116) that his thoughts \"became ruddy in light,\" it is clear that he considers this luminous phenomenon to be a divine confirmation of his inspiration. There is reason to compare these visions with those in which Swedenborg's thoughts are \"represented\" by \"a kind of illuminated spiritual writing\" (Journal of Dreams § 111). The most remarkable vi­ sions he records at that time are incontestably the apparitions of Christ. In several of them, he is allowed to contemplate Christ face to 129"

It is very proba­ ble that these visions, like those observed with most mystics, should be regarded as pseudohallucinations. Unlike psychosensory halluci­ nations, pseudohallucinations are not localized within the subject's normal field of vision. Swedenborg declares that his apparitions are perceived by his \"internal sight,\" by \"his spiritual eyes.\" Such is, at least, the sense to which it seems necessary to attribute the passage in which he notes that \"in the same instant Jesus Christ was presented vividly before my internal eyes\" (Journal of Dreams §168). It is no less probable that the auditory perceptions noted by Swedenborg in his journal are also of a pseudohallucinatory nature. The journal does not display any precision in this respect, however; most often, Swedenborg limits himself to writing, \"It was told me,\" etc. In his account of his conversation with Christ during his grand vision, he says absolutely nothing of the fashion in which the words of Jesus reached him. But in The Worship and Love of God, which he has already begun to write at the time, as well as in his first exegetical work, the Historia Creationis a Mose Tradita (The History of Creation as Related by Moses), which he will write the next year, one finds the mention of a language of spirits, as sonorous as that externally articu­ lated by the lips and tongue, although it is not transmitted by sounds but is rather perceived by the mind or by \"the internal sight\" (Adver­ saria I, §§15-16). This description agrees entirely with that which psychiatrists give of verbal pseudohallucinations: the subject does not localize these by ear, even though they otherwise have the nature of an auditory perception as well as, sometimes, a certain sonority. If, despite the insufficiency of material, I consider it reasonable to accept the visionary phenomena of which Sweden borg speaks in his Journal of Dreams as pseudohallucinatory and not as hallucina­ tions properly speaking, it is not only because we see there the ordinary instrumentality by which Swedenborg communicates with the world of spirits since the day his \"spiritual sight\" was opened. The manner in which he reacts to these mystic apparitions also indicates that they can hardly be of a psychosensory nature. A true hallucination, with the characteristics of a complete sensory percep­ tion, provokes in the subject an impression of terror-whatever con­ tent it may have-especially when it makes its appearance for the 130"

A pseudohallucination, on the other hand, does not produce this immediate impression of external reality. The subject conceives of it as something objective, independent of his will; but he does not at any moment, during the course of the hallucination, confuse these \"inner\" visions or these \"internal\" voices with real visions or voices. On the contrary, most often he considers himself as the object of a psychic influence; maleficent or beneficent forces come into associa­ tion with him through these visions or voices and dominate his inner life. It is the same with Swedenborg. He himself characterizes his own mystic states of that period as \"being in the spirit.\" It is evident that he associates these states with the psychology of the Economy of the Animal Kingdom and that he understands thereby a state in which only the anima is active. It also stands out in Swedenborg's journal that he induces this state by suspending his respiration. In a passage of the Journal of Dreams (§ 111), he expounds his respiration theory, which he will often repeat later. According to him, thoughts \"fly into the body\" at the moment of inhalation and are expelled in exhalation. It suffices, then, to suspend breathing when one is assailed by \"evil thoughts.\" Moreover, he observes that, during a period of ecstasy, a respiratory suspension was also produced and \"the thoughts then seemed to have vanished. On the other hand, during sleep, when in­ halation and exhalation are natural phenomena, then that is repre­ sented which flows into us from a higher world.\" In another passage, he notes further, \"I had something like a vision-I suspended my own thoughts and was seized, as usual, by a trembling, which signi­ fied that I should not keep on like that for long, especially on Sunday or in the evening.\" These physical symptoms-suspension of respiration and the shivering-playa particularly important role in the ecstasies, numer­ ous descriptions of which are contained in the Journal of Dreams.

      "text": "EMAMUEL SWEDEN BORG: THE DEVELOPMENT OF HIS THOUGHT he describes as a union of the deepest spiritual and sensory delight. He says that he is able to experience this inner ''jucunditet,'' which he equates \"with a heavenly joy on this earth,\" at any hour of the day or night but more particularly in the morning or the evening (Journal of Dreams §201). It is \"the spirit ... the infiowing of the spirit of God\" which \"causes me to rise higher and higher, so that had I continued my assent I would be dissolved in this very \"vita gaudii\" (Journal of Dreams §127). To illustrate the nature of these experiences, we shall relate here the first of the ecstasies of which Swedenborg gives a rather detailed description. He declares that since December 9 he has found himself \"almost continuously in extasibus vigilibus\" (\"waking ecstasies\"). The night following Easter day, after having taken communion that same day, he found himself at dawn immersed \"in an indescribable heav­ enly ecstasy.\" He says, \"I felt within me a sheaf of rays, feeling that martyrdom would be the supreme joy, for, due to the indescribable grace associated with the love of God, one longs for this torture which is as nothing compared with eternal torment, and the least is to lay down one's own life; and I felt in my mind and body such inex­ pressible beatitude that, had it been more intense, my entire body would have dissolved into pure joy\" (Journal of Dreams §§47-48). The form of ecstasy described here by Swedenborg recalls at every point the kind we encounter in the confessions of most of the mystics. It is a trance that does not much differ from a hypnotic state. The subject who, by a concentration of his thoughts and feelings on God and infinite love, withdraws himself from all the impressions, representations, or ideas alien to the Divinity, feels himself entirely suffused by divine love and is nothing but a oneness in God (cf. the Plotinian description of ecstasy in chapter five). This sensation, for most mystics as for Swedenborg, consists of a mixture of enjoyment and pain;14S again like most of the mystics, Swedenborg specifies that this pleasure is itself also of a purely physical character. Psychologists of religion have established by definitive examples that the \"delicious martyrdom\" of which the mystics claim to be the prey most often includes a sexual element of which the subject himself is not always clearly conscious. As often observed in religious manifes­ tations, the love of God does not remain content here with drawing on 132"

Instead of the half­ veiled allusions of other mystics, he gives us the most explicit descrip­ tion of the actual process. It is thus that he writes, with regard to an ecstasy that he experienced some nights later (Journal of Dreams §88), \"This amor in the flesh of the mortal body, by which I was then suf­ fused, recalled the pleasure which a chaste man experiences when he finds himself in a state of true love in ipso actu with his spouse; for such was the amaenitas extrema [\"extreme pleasantness\"] that pene­ trated my whole body.\" In other passages, he is even more explicit. In his description of this later ecstasy, he likewise analyzes in de­ tail the condition necessary for its appearance, that is, mental concen­ tration upon a single object. He relates how he found himself submerged in the ecstasy shortly preceding drowsiness or immedi­ ately after awakening; for half an hour or an hour, it sufficed to open or close his eyes to escape that ecstatic state or to prolong it. He then understands that this ecstatic state is evoked by the concentration of his love on Jesus Christ and that \"the moment I attached myself to another object of love, I was immediately diverted from my way; so that all my self-love or all love incapable of concentration withdrew me from the ecstasy, and I felt within me a kind of slight chill, like a shiver that accompanies nausea.\" This brief outline of the states of ecstasy reported in the Journal of Dreams allows us to undertake, without much discussion, an exam­ ination of the crises of which the journal gives a glimpse. The focal point around which this phase of Swedenborg's life and meditations revolves is, naturally, the mystic union of man with the divine. Despite all his efforts, he feels himself \"so profoundly apart from God [that I am] unable as yet to think of him in such a liv­ ing manner\" (Journal of Dreams §164). The obstacles in the way of this union are in part the same as those he indicated in the Economy of the Animal Kingdom, particularly the constant struggle the inner man has to sustain against the external man. These are the drives of the animus and temptations of the senses that prevent the anima from shedding its light. Sweden borg believes he has observed \"that in each 133"

The reason why: a continual battle is waged; and we are in no way able to unite with the spirit, but the spirit unites with us by grace. For we are as dead to all that is good, being our own masters only with regard to evil\" (Journal of Dreams § 11 0). As we see, Swedenborg here emphasizes still more categorically than in the Economy of the Animal Kingdom the negative character of our free will, which can assert itself positively only with regard to sin. More than ever Sweden borg, during this religious crisis, has a clear awareness of his own powerlessness to save himself by his own strength and of the necessity of divine grace. The distance that here separates him from his previous conceptions appears, perhaps, with the greatest clarity in those passages of his journal where he comes closest to the reasonings of his earlier philosophy. Thus, he relates, for example, having struggled in vain one day against the thoughts that take hold of his spirit against his will and escape his control. He then understands that the grace of God alone can save him from these thoughts. I can compare it to two scales of a balance, in the one of which is our own will and perverse nature; in the other, God's power, which our Lord so places in temptation that he sometimes lets it come to an equilibrium, but so soon as ever it will weigh down one side, he helps it up. So I have found it, to speak in ordinary language. From this it follows that our power that presses down that scale is little, and that it rather opposes than assists the power of the spirit; and thus it is only our Lord's work, which he disposes. (Journal of Dreams §66) Swedenborg himself observes that he resumes here his old con­ ception of the Economy of the Animal Kingdom and adds (Journal of Dreams §67): \"I felt that many things appeared in my thoughts which had been previously inspired and recognized as the truths of the 134"

Certainly, the difference between this passage and that in the Economy of the Animal Kingdom to which Swedenborg makes special allusion is rather marked. In the latter, he expresses the conviction that, despite the limitation of his free will, human beings can and should take the initiative in investigating the area of divine grace. The will of God could not be made to operate otherwise than through our own will. Here, on the contrary, it seems to him, as it does to most of the mystics, that our own will constitutes only an ob­ stacle to our salvation. We should seek to annihilate it completely and to abandon ourselves in a completely passive manner to the divine force that tends to raise us up. This reasoning, which we have at times glimpsed in his mind, acquires its most complete form at the actual moment of crisis. He considers that \"Christ should be all in all, or God through Christ; so that we cannot ourselves do the very least; still less strive; for it is best to give oneself up in surrender at discre­ tion: and still further, could a man therein be quite passive, it were the most perfect\" (Journal of Dreams §266). But it is not merely important for Swedenborg to annihilate his will in order to obtain divine grace. Reason itself constitutes an obsta­ cle to the achievement of \"strong faith.\" When Swedenborg plunges into reading the Bible or when he attends a service, he notes that his thoughts, even if they are \"confirmatory,\" project a disturbance into his spirit and \"open the way to contrary thoughts one is helpless to re­ ject.\" The true faith, which one acquires only by grace, is the \"faith without reason.\" It differs from and surpasses reason. \"It is the pura fides: the other faith remains impure as long as it is mixed with rea- son: reason must be subjected to faith and one consequently should believe that He, who is God and is everywhere, expresses the truth it­ self\" (Journal of Dreams §152). As we shall see later, this is the concept that is to lead Sweden borg to abandon his philosophical scientific works in order to give himself entirely to the religious apostolate. 135"

These are in the main identical to those met with in the majority of mystics in the corresponding critical phases of their lives. It is to this reasoning and to these states that the psychic occurrences he records in his Journal of Dreams are related. The most important of these occurrences is undoubtedly his grand vision of Christ at Easter 1744. That is the first call from God. To a certain degree it presages the great vision of 1745, following which Swedenborg will definitely renounce his scientific career to consecrate himself exclusively to his religious mission. It is clear that, during the days preceding the Easter holiday, Swedenborg found himself in a state of particularly marked nervous hypertension. He had been warned by a dream that, if he took flight, he would be subjected to severe punishment on Maundy Thursday [§33]. He had also been seized by a violent fit of weeping, lamenting that he had not loved God and, on the contrary, had offended him when God wished to show Swedenborg the ways to the kingdom of grace [§36]. On Easter day, he continues to be the prey of the \"an­ guish of the reprobate\" which is translated into an excess of \"trem­ bling.\" Having taken communion, he feels a bit calmer in the certainty that his sins are forgiven, but he is no less assailed by temp­ tations; deprived of confidence and love, he feels incapable of control­ ling his \"fugitive\" thoughts [§39]. During the night, temptation appears in the person of Erland Broman (a famous bon vivant, a fa­ vorite of King Frederick I, whom he served as a go-between for \"the minor diversions\"). On awakening, Swedenborg has the impression of having been delivered \"by the intervention of Christ and the action of the Holy Spirit\" [§42]. Going back to sleep, he feels himself subject of a sort of purification during which he is \"enveloped by wonderful and indescribable circumvolutions ... of which I know not how to speak, being a series of mystical action\" [§43]. On reawakening, he is plunged into the ecstasy described above, an ecstasy that is main­ tained during the whole day, culminating in a spiritual calm [§44]. Toward the evening of the same day, nevertheless, he is sub­ jected to \"a new temptation.\" He has just read in the Bible \"the mir­ acles accomplished by God through Moses.\" He observes that his 136"

To be sure, he smiles to himself at these questions, but he nonetheless recognizes that they trouble him and that his \"faith was not firm .... I looked into the fire, saying to myself that I should not believe that it existed, being the tes­ timony of the senses more deceitful than the Work of God, the ipsa veritas which is proper to believe rather than trust in oneself' [§50]. After these thoughts, he smiled to the tempter. We quote the sequel of his relation in extenso: At ten o'clock I went to bed and felt a little better. Half an hour after, I heard a noise under my head. I thought that the tempter was then going away. Straightway there came over me a shud­ dering, so strong from the head downwards and over the whole body, with a noise of thunder, and this happened several times. I found that something holy was upon me. I then fell into a sleep; and at about 12:00, 1:00, or 2:00 in the night, there came over me a strong shuddering from head to foot, with a thundering noise as if many winds beat together, which shook me; it was indescribable and prostrated me on my face. Then at the time I was prostrated, at that very moment, I was wide awake, and saw that I was cast down. Wondered what it meant. And I spoke as ifI were awake; but found nevertheless that the words were put into my mouth. \"And oh! Almighty Jesus Christ, that thou, of thy so great mercy, deignest to come to so great a sinner. Make me worthy of thy grace.\" I held my hands together hard. Straightaway thereupon, I continued my prayer, and said, \"Thou hast promised to take to grace all sinners; thou canst nothing else than keep thy word.\" At that same moment, I sat in his bosom, and saw him face to face; it was a face of holy mien, and in all it was indescribable, and he smiled so that I believe that his face had indeed been like this when he lived on earth. He spoke to me and asked if I had a clear bill of health. I 137"

(Journalo/Dreams §§51-54) Not long afterward Swedenborg finds himself \"again in a state that was neither sleep nor awake.\" He reflected on what he had just experienced; for a few moments he doubts that it was truly the Son of God who has thus appeared and come down to him. He nevertheless concludes that his vision is real and \"asked forgiveness for having so long doubted and for having asked a miracle, a thought it was not proper for me to have\" [§56] Since this apparition is the earliest of Swedenborg's grand vi­ sions, which in a certain sense has a decisive influence on his life, it warrants brief pause. We note that, as in the first vision, here it is a matter of wake­ fulness or partial wakefulness, and not, as Tafel appears to believe, a dream.l 47 In that case, there would have been nothing extraordinary, and the experience would surely not have had such a great influence on Sweden borg's later development. He himself declares that, at the moment of prostration, he was \"wide awake,\" and it is evident that he is in full awareness when Christ appears to him. The reflection and prayers that follow the apparition likewise suppose a conscious state, even though Swedenborg himself states that he found himself \"neither asleep not awake.\" It is noteworthy too that this vision is ob­ viously produced at the very moment of awakening. During his sleep, Swedenborg perceives a loud noise; he awakens trembling and finds himself prostrate in his bed. With a feeling of inexplicable an­ guish, he prays to Christ, in a purely automatic manner, to appear to him. It is then that he perceives the first apparition, the sensation of a hand strongly pressing his clasped hands. In the light of research undertaken during the course of the last twenty or thirty years on the mystic states of soul, it does not seem to me impossible to analyze the above vision somewhat more closely. It obviously has its origin in the \"feeling of presence\" that has given rise to so many visions. I shall here follow the description of this feeling 138"

It con­ sists of awakening with a start and imagining there is someone in the room. Delacroix supposes that these brusque and anguished awaken­ ings are often influenced by a dream or nightmare that has already been forgotten at the moment of awakening. From the very fact that the subject finds himself \"at the transition point between dream and the awakening, his mental control is partially suspended and he is easily led to give his emotion a defined subject.\"149 This objectifica­ tion is naturally more marked in subjects with hallucinatory tenden­ cies. Delacroix cites several cases drawn from his own practice, in which this feeling of presence produces a veritable dialogue between the subject and the invisible spirit whose presence he senses. As Delacroix justly claims, the question becomes more complex when dealing with mystics. Among these, the sensing of presence is manifested by an object in the form of a determined personality: Jesus Christ, demons, angels, all personalities with whom they have not had previously any direct acquaintance. One seeks to explain this phenomenon as the hallucinatory reproduction of a group of emotions conceived by the subject as likely to accompany the pres­ ence of the respective being. In the case Delacroix deals with here, es­ pecially the first Christ vision of St. Teresa (which at many points resembles that of Sweden borg), the subject has long sought to picture to herself the emotion she would experience if she found herself face to face with the Savior. Tormented by doubt, St. Teresa has for a long time begged Jesus Christ to grant a confirmation of her faith. And in the course of prayer, of mystic crisis, a form of ecstasy where words come automatically to the mouth of the person speaking, we see reproduced the entire emotional content that the saint has for so long cherished in her heart: \"the impression of objective presence.\" And St. Teresa has no difficulty in identifying the person of Jesus Christ. All the above phases are again found in Swedenborg's vision. He also has been tormented by grave doubts, and it is only after the 139"

While he waits impatiently to see his faith strengthened by a manifest reve­ lation, he ardently appeals for an assurance of divine grace. The whole of Easter day, his partaking of communion, and his strange dream of \"purification\" by grace of the Holy Spirit awakens in him a kind of presentiment of occurrences that will be decisive. From his first awakening, when \"the tempter\" departs with loud noise, he be­ lieves he feels within him \"something holy.\" When he awakens for the second time, feeling he has heard thunder, and finds himself lying in his bed, this sense of presence becomes naturally more intense. In the prayer, he pronounces, directly after his awakening, the words of which are put into his mouth. He already believes it is the Christ who comes to him, and he fervently begs to be made worthy of this great grace. So it is that the hallucination develops gradually: it is at first sensory (he feels a hand press his), then visual, and finally auditory, when in the course of a fervent prayer the apparition addresses him. The enigmatic and entirely unexpected form of these words confirms in his mind the reality of the vision. For Swedenborg, it is a new proof that it was Jesus Christ who has appeared to him)50 It is in the vision of that night that it is proper to seek the origi­ nal of the religious meditation by which Swedenborg is besieged dur­ ing the weeks that follow. It seems clear to him that he has been the object of a special divine grace because he has been permitted to see the Savior. And his mind does not cease from thinking that, after an experience of that nature, he might well be considered a saint. The following night he writes: When, as was often the case, I was in my thoughts about these very subjects, and anyone accounted me a holy man and on this account offered me dignity-as indeed it happens among cer­ tain simple people that they not only venerate but even adore some supposedly holy man as a saint-I then found that, in the earnestness which then possessed me, I desired to do him all the ill I could to the highest degree, in order that nothing at all of the sin should stick to him, and that with earnest prayers I ought to appease our Lord, in order that I might never have any part of so damning a sin to stick to me. 140"

(Journal of Dreams §§72-73) From now on, Swedenborg deplores his vain efforts to recover the inspired state of the preceding night. \"At times I could by no means get my thoughts to contemplate the Christ that I had seen for that short moment. The movement and the power of the spirit came to me, and I felt that I would rather go mad\" (Journal of Dreams 65). He considers himself as \"more unworthy than others and the greatest of sinners, as our Lord has permitted me to go deeper into certain things with my thoughts than many people\" (Journal of Dreams §74). And when, the following day, he hears one of his table companions ask one of the others present \"if one could be really melancholic when he had an abundance of money,\" he sadly smiles to himself. He believes he knows better than anyone else that the sadness and melancholy arising from the lack of all \"means\" could not be equal to the melancholy arising from inner torments. From that instant, he begins to feel himself as an exceptional being, having experienced more than has been granted to any man. In a well-erased and almost illegible passage in his notes of the same date, he relates that he continues to move in his normal social circles without anyone being able to observe the least change in him. He also knows that he has become another person \"not daring to say that so high grace has been vouchsafed me\" [§80]. Indeed, he wonders what his friends would think if they were informed of his new state and, on the other hand, he fears that an announcement of his new state might inspire \"a love of self\" in him. His designation as an instru­ ment of God has happened so suddenly and under such unexpected circumstances that he has some difficulty imagining the reality of his mission. \"I found no better comparison for myself than when a peas­ ant is raised to power as a chief or king and can command all that his heart desired; but who yet had something in him that caused him to wish to learn that of which he himself knew nothing\" (Journal of Dreams §81). Swedenborg dedicated the following days to the reading of the \"confession of sins, prayer, and fasting.\" He awaits a new appearance ofJesus Christ. Now and then, he believes that he is close to his goal. 141"

And when, on the following night, \"thoughts come to him about his excess of dignity in his relations with others,\" he begs with clasped hands to be delivered from them; moreover, his prayer is heard. A few nights later he is prey to \"double thoughts\" and experi­ ences violent temptation. \"Through the grace of the Spirit, I was brought to fasten my thoughts on a tree, then upon Christ's cross and on Christ crucified. As often as I did this, the other thoughts as of themselves fell flat. I pressed with the same thought so forcibly that I seemed with the cross to press down the tempter and drive him away\" (Journal of Dreams §§121-122). He asks God for the grace to constantly behold his crucified Savior before his eyes, \"for I dared by no means look upon my Jesus, him that I have seen; for I am an un­ worthy sinner; but rather I ought to fall upon my face; and Jesus it is that takes me up to look upon him; for thus I am enabled to look upon Christ crucified\" (Journal of Dreams §122). From this exposi­ tion, it is clear that here it is not a case of a hallucinatory phenome­ non, but an imaginative image evoked voluntarily, which ends in acquiring such intensity that Swedenborg truly believes that he is see­ ing in spirit the crucified one himself. This ecstatic cult of the crucifix, of a nearly Catholic ardor, nev­ ertheless appeared presumptuous and sinful to Swedenborg the next day. His father appeared to him in a dream, his face reflecting anger, saying, \"'You are creating alarm, Emanuel.' ... It meant that yester­ day I had made too bold a use of Christ's cross.\" Nevertheless, on awakening, he again has before his eyes \"the crucifixion and cross of Jesus.\" A little later, however, the resemblance of these phenomena with the Catholic worship of the cross enters his mind. In thought, he has \"embraced Christ on the cross. Then I kissed his feet and after­ wards removed myself away; then falling upon my knees I prayed to him crucified.\" And it occurs to him \"that I could have the same thing before the eyes of my body in an image; but I found was far from right and was a great sin\" (Journal of Dreams §128). 142"

In his dream the following night, he hears the two words \"Nicolaus Nicolai\" pronounced. \"I do not know,\" he says, \" if that is my new name.\" During the Easter holidays, he has the feeling of a fragmenta­ tion of personality. He is astonished to be able to have \"two entirely different thoughts at the same time.\" This separation has now oc­ curred. \"The most remarkable thing was this: that I now represented the inner man and was as another person than myself, so that I made salutation to my own thoughts, frightening them; saluted my own stores of memory; accused another person; which shows that the change has come. I represent one who is against another; that is to say, the inner man, for I have prayed God that I in no wise may be mine but that God may be pleased to let me be his\" (Journal of Dreams § 133). And he adds, \"This has now lasted for twenty-one days.\" From then on, all his efforts are to free himself from the exter­ nal man, that is from his own personality, in order to become an in­ strument entirely in the hands of God. He constantly prays God to make him his and to withdraw him from his selfhood. With equal fervor he asks for that \"all-powerful\" faith, \"without reasonings.\" But he is not yet convinced that this new personality will be compati­ ble with the scientific researches that have hitherto occupied him. At times, he is disposed to believe that this is the case. In one of his vi­ sions he is reminded that King Charles XII, after having suffered an initial repulse by Saxons, won the battle in a second engagement, \"which signifies that with God's grace I have won the fight, and that Jesus' blood and merits helped me, and that I in my studies shall win in the end\" (Journal of Dreams §lS6). The next day, after having dreamed of returning to Sweden, in an attack of discouragement, he composes himself \"and found that I am come to do the best of all and to promote God's honor; got the talent; all helped thereto. The Spirit was with me from youth to this end\" (Journal of Dreams §164). But, from the days that follow, he feels warranted in concluding from his visions that the will of God is \"that I ought to employ my remaining time upon matters that are higher; and not to write upon worldly themes any more, themes which are comparatively very low; 143"

God be so gracious and enlighten me further about what my duty is; for I am still in some darkness as to whither I should turn\" (Journal of Dreams §185). The preceding night it appeared to him \"in a certain way that I ought not to contaminate myself with other books which concern theological and similar propositions; for this I have in God's Word and from the Holy Spirit\" (Journal of Dreams §180). Now he seems to imagine that it is the will of God that he pub­ lish the work he has undertaken and with regard to which it has been revealed to him that \"he will obtain approval,\" but he thinks that he should undertake another work of an entirely different nature later. He learns that his \"speculation should turn ad priora which were for­ merly in posterioribus\" (Journal of Dreams §195). By this somewhat obscure formula, Swedenborg understands without any doubt that God will henceforth grant him the faculty of attaining knowledge a priori, a faculty that he considers in his previous works as having been lost to humanity after the Fall and was reserved to angels. In a note from the same day, he likewise relates that he has learned from a dream that he ought to refrain from eating and drinking too much, \"for such is the life of pigs, which is forbidden by Paul.\" He should live like a \"novus homo in Christo.\" It is in this strange state of exaltation that Swedenborg arrives in England in the month of May. Very soon after his arrival, he seems to be in contact with the Moravian Bretheren, whose services he attends in Fetter Lane. From his first visit, he declares that they call them­ selves \"true Lutherans and recognize the work of the Hold Ghost, as they tell each other, and only regard God's grace and Christ's blood and merits and simply go to work.\" He relates also that their church had been \"represented\" to him three months previously (Journal of Dreams §202). That the \"religion of the heart\" of Zinzendorf, with its aversion to any metaphysical subtleties and its concentration on the inner life in Christ, had had, precisely at that time, certain elements in common with the religiosity of Swedenborg is easy to understand; moreover, it is clear from the above quotation. \"One has to raise the cross of God before people, thus arousing in them a vision of the splendor of God's majesty\"151 was one of Zinzendorf's foremost rules of life. 144"

The latter of these alternatives is probably the case. I have been unable to find in Swedenborg's later theology the slightest trace of his brief relations with the Moravian Brethren. This love of Christ, strongly colored by Catholicism, which characterizes the state of Swedenborg's soul during this period of crisis, disappears later on so completely that there barely remains any place in his theo­ logical system for the historical figure of Jesus Christ. At most points, he later finds himself in unmitigated conflict with Zinzendorfs teachings, whose Christocentric doctrine and exegetic liberalism are to hold a special antipathy for him. Of all the contemporary sects, it is the Moravian that is the most criticized in Swedenborg's later works. As a result of the aversion he showed to Zinzendorf and his follow­ ers, Sweden borg was the object of a marked antipathy among the Brethren, both in Sweden and abroad. Due to the aversion the Moravians showed him, Swedenborg's biographers have tried to explain the rumors of insanity that finally reached Sweden. These gained such intensity that, according to one of his contemporaries,152 there might have been a serious question of having Swedenborg declared \"mentally disturbed as a result of reli­ gious dreams\" by the Diet of 1769. One can establish with certitude the origin of these rumors in Swedenborg's sojourn in London dur­ ing his period of crisis. The author could well be the Moravian Brother Brockmer, who was Swedenborg's landlord for some time. It is absolutely impossible, however, to determine the historical accuracy of his declarations, which were largely transmitted second­ hand, and are contradictory besides. 153 In brief, they are substantially that Swedenborg had displayed most eccentric behavior; proclaimed himself the Savior come to be crucified by the Jews; stripped himself in the marketplace and rolled in the mud; was given to strange rites of washing of feet; and suffered fits of delirium. 145"

It would also perhaps throw light on the psychic cri­ sis Sweden borg experienced at that time.154 But it is not possible for me personally to pronounce on the matter, and the experts have reached contradictory conclusions in their attempts to establish a rather imprecise diagnosis of psychosis, so I can only pass over these problems as unresolved.1 55 From the information we can extract from his journal, it does not appear that Swedenborg's psychic or physical condition had undergone any notable modification during the preceding months. He stayed in England to work all summer long on his Animal Kingdom, the first two parts of which appeared at The Hague, and the third part of which was printed in London in the spring of 1745. A large part of his dreams continue to relate to his scientific occupations and are supplemented by the brief notes or allu­ sions in the works published at this time. His religious crisis appears to follow a more or less uniform de­ velopment. He continues to complain that \"his body rebels unceas­ ingly.\" He is exposed to the same temptations as before and aspires to return to the state \"in which Christ accords his divine grace.\" What appears to be lacking above all is the true spirit of childlike inno­ cence. In various manifestations, God has taught him that \"one must be like a child before the Lord\" and that God will grant everything he needs, both profane and spiritual, \"from the moment when, like a child, I entrust all my cares to him\" (Journal of Dreams §222). One night, he dreams that he finds himself in \"the kingdom of inno­ cence.\" He sees below him \"the loveliest garden that could be seen. On every tree white roses were set in succession. Went afterwards into a long room. There were beautiful white dishes with milk and bread in them, so appetizing that nothing more appetizing could be imagined.\" He meets there \"a lovely innocent child\" who seemed to him \"innocence itself' (Journal of Dreams §257). Only then does he understand that he can directly receive all knowledge of God, \"hav­ ing now reached the state of understanding that I know nothing, that all praeconcepta judicia [prejudices] have been taken from me, which is the beginning of learning to know that one must first become as a 146"

However, what predominates in the latter part of the journal is the question of whether Swedenborg should abandon his scientific labors. As we have seen, during the earliest stages of this crisis, he has already shown some intention of abandoning science altogether, be­ cause it attracted him to the world and led him into complacency. He now reproaches himself as before for having felt vanity in his work in the eyes of his contemporaries (Journal of Dreams §231). His dreams and visions evidently do not enable him to be certain of God's will in this respect; it seems to him at times that they are encouraging him to pursue his researches. Thus, during the night of September 29-30, he sees an apparition that confirms for him that what \"with God's help, I have written lately about forms is such that it shall carry me on still further to that which is still more glorious\" (Journal of Dreams §244). But he becomes aware several nights later that this has been inspired by evil spirits. Nevertheless, during the night of October 6 or 7, he receives an indication of the road he should follow. He understands that \"all love of anything whatever, for instance, to my works I have in had, when one loves them and not as a medium to the only love that is to God and Jesus Christ, is a meretricious love.\" At the same time, he re­ ceives a revelation of a divine book which has the mission to write: \"Otherwise, it is something told me about my book. One said that it was a divine book on the worship and love of God (Liber divinus de Dei cultu et amore). I believe it was also something about spirits. I be­ lieved I had something about this in my book De Infinito. But, to this, no answer was made\" (Journal of Dreams §2S0). It is naturally the supreme sacrifice for Swedenborg to thus abandon, after so many years, the work he hoped to bring to a grand conclusion, and it is evident how that thought tortures him. Some nights afterward in a dream, he believes he is being punished for hav­ ing been \"busy with my work, which is quite different from the other and quite another love if it should prevail, and is not to be regarded as a matter of words or as a plaything in regard to the other.\" And upon awakening, he resolved to abandon this work. But he goes back to sleep and has a new dream that relates precisely to the chapter in 147"

God grant that it be not against His good pleasure\" (Journal of Dreams §262-263). The night of October 26--27, when he speaks in a dream with Jesus Christ, he learns that he should begin, on the following day, the new divine book regarding which he has already had a revelation. He is told that he \"should not occupy himself with other affairs than my own. . . . May God guide me in the right way. Christ said that I should undertake nothing without Him\" (Journal of Dreams §278). That night ends in a deliquium of the same nature as the one he had experienced seven years previously in Amsterdam, when he began work on the Economy of the Animal Kingdom (see above, chap­ ter three), \"but much more subtle, so that I appeared to be near death.\" Like its predecessor, this phenomenon signifies for him \"that my head is actually swept and cleansed from that which would hin­ der these thoughts.\" The \"penetration\" that he has just acquired is also reflected by the fact that \"I seemed to write a fine hand\" (Journal of Dreams §262). Sweden borg's entries end here. He then believes he has attained the goal, pursued consciously or unconsciously during that whole crisis, of killing his selfhood and abandoning himself as a passive instrument in the hands of God. He believes he has renounced, not only his scientific preoccupations and his scientific ambitions, but all his knowledge as well, to become a child again, in order that divine light might suffuse his soul without hindrance. He has attained the most inaccessible of objects, \"unrea­ soning faith.\" And this change also appears to him in certain external signs. In the entry for October 9, he relates that he has become so sharp-sighted that he is able to read the small-print Bible without the least difficulty\" (Journal of Dreams §260). Several days later he is in­ formed in a dream that \"for the last fourteen days my appearance has been growing much handsomer, and to be like that of an angel\" (Journal of Dreams §268). It is also toward the end of this crisis that Swedenborg finds the explanation for why the apparitions and visions he has experienced have at times seemed contradictory. In an entry spanning several days (October 3-6) he declares, \"Several times I have remarked that there 148"

By the others man is en­ ticed in a thousand ways to go with them; but unhappy is he that does so .... Therefore, it is necessary to distinguish the spirits, which is a thing man cannot do except through Christ Himself and His Spirit.\" It is evident from the very form of the above entry that Sweden­ borg is here alluding to the well-known exhortation to distinguish between spirits based on the idea, found in primitive Christianity,156 that demons can act upon man under forms resembling, and mis­ taken for, the spirit of God: \"Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, for many false prophets have come into the world. By this you know the spirit of God: every spirit which confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God, and every spirit which does not confess Jesus is not of God. This is the spirit of antichrist, of which you heard that it was coming, and now it is in the world already\" (1 John 4:1-3). The primary origin of Swedenborg's experience of the existence of different kinds of spirits appears to have been a \"representation\" of which he was the object during a midday nap on October 3. The entry recording this (Journal of Dreams §246) is rather difficult to in­ terpret because several words have been omitted, but it is to the effect that our thoughts, in themselves, \"bear within them no other end and reason than that which comes into them from the Spirit of God (spir­ itu Dei), or the spirit of the body (spiritu corporis). If from the body, then all is sin from the innermost; for we aim after nothing else than that which strives against the spiritual.\" And Swedenborg adds: \"Which rules we ourselves may observe if we reflect from our loves, which, in fact, accompany [us].\" It is clear that these are the loves dominated either by the \"Spirit of God\" or by the \"spirit of the body\" which, in Swedenborg's mind, appear to be provoked by spirits. We find direct confirmation of this in the journal entry dated October 6-7 (Journal of Dreams §252), where it is said, \"From this and the foregoing we find how soon and how easily a human being is deceived by other spirits, which repre­ sent themselves according to the love of each and every person, for loves are represented by spirits, indeed, in fact, by women\" (the text ends here). 149"

      "text": "EMAMUEL SWEDEN BORG: THE DEVELOPMENT OF HIS THOUGHT This reasoning is later developed in The Worship and Love of God, which dates from that crisis. Human beings are subjected to two contrary influences, one emanating from God and the other from the Prince of the World: one, love of supreme good, the other, love for the greatest evil. Celestial beings, amores or \"loves,\" act by way of the anima, while the genii of evil, our sensual passions, reach the anima by way of the body. Everyone has an infinitude of loves within him­ or herself. But by reason of their very number, they escape our con­ trol, and each of them can disguise itself as the supreme love; in other words, we can be led to grant supremacy to a love that is sensual by nature and belongs to the animus (The Worship and Love of God §68). During Swedenborg's theosophical years, this conception was, as we know, elevated to the rank of a perfectly characterized doctrine of spirits. Humanity is not led directly by God, but by angels and spirits. Every person is associated with two heavenly and two infernal spirits, who exercise their influence on all his or her thoughts and feelings. Every temptation emanates from spirits in matters of faith and from genii in manifestations of will. The spirits externalize themselves in visible form, but genii manifest themselves only by the influence they exert on the desires and passions of the individual. And this action is exercised so secretly and in such a malicious fash­ ion that the person cannot imagine it is from them that temptations come, and believes that he or she is acting spontaneously (cf. Arcana Coelestia §751, §5035ff.) I have already pointed out several times how much Sweden­ borg's system, with its dualism between divine and worldly influ­ ences, between the internal and external person, was apt to provoke a demonological development of this nature. Well before his crisis, he believed in the influence of supersensory beings on a person's will (see chapter two above). This belief finds fresh confirmation in the visions he has during the period of the Journal of Dreams. He himself has felt that the devil has penetrated to the very core of his being, seeking to lead him into temptation and that he has rejected it by the interven­ tion of the Christ. Faced by the contradictions that he has observed in his visions, he ends by formulating certain suspicions; he feels he is the prey of malicious spirits who disguise themselves in an effort to appear in his eyes as the very spirit of Jesus Christ, the only true love. 150"

In the first woman who appears to him in dreams (Jour­ nal of Dreams § 17), he believes he recognizes his \"guardian angel.\" One can scarcely avoid seeing the psychological cause of these ever more erotic dreams in which amorous relations with various women appear to him.

Lehmann, the well-known psychologist, has even concluded from this that Swedenborg's nervous system was \"thrown into com­ plete confusion by sexual excesses.\"158 I have no competence to decide if Sweden borg's notes, by them­ selves alone, warrant a hypothesis of this nature. It is, nevertheless, at variance with all that we know of his private life and personality. However that may be, it is evident that the sexual factor after that time plays a considerable role in his imagined religious environment. I shall limit myself, in this respect, to recalling the descriptions he gives on several occasions of the state of supreme ecstatic bliss, which he identifies with erotic intoxication. It is not correct, however, as Lehmann and other biographers attempt to do, to emphasize the abnormal nature of Swedenborg's sexuality and represent him as a kind of St. Anthony who by ardent prayer sought to free himself from the feminine apparitions that pursue him in his dreams. On the contrary, he welcomes the appari­ tions with the same satisfaction as his erotic ecstasies. Physical love appears to him, then and later, as something heavenly, as a stage lead­ ing to the supreme love, the love of God. At the close of one of his most detailed descriptions of his erotic dreams, he notes in his journal for April 23-24 (Journal of Dreams §174): \"This denotes the 151"

They represent \"objects of knowledge,\" \"wisdom,\" \"truth,\" \"piety,\" etc. His sexual relations with the apparitions express his love of wisdom and so on. At times (for example, in the entry for April 28-29), he dreams that he moves away from a woman who has slipped into his bed. She then symbol­ izes his profane activities as an author, which he ought to abandon for more elevated matters (Journal of Dreams §185). As we see, he re­ gards the women perceived in dreams as the spirits of various essences; because of the frequency with which they recur in his jour­ nal, it is not impossible that they may have inspired his first notion of the doctrine of spirits. We observe likewise, that in The Worship and Love of God, he envisages Adam as being in relations with spirits in the forms of women. Even during his theosophical period, Sweden­ borg interprets the visions of nude women as signs of love for spiri­ tual objects (cf. Spiritual Diary §3856). In his biblical exegesis, the term woman signifies \"propensities for truth\" (affectiones veri). The brief description I have just given of the Journal of Dreams has perhaps not made the role of the system of correspondences in this context sufficiently evident. Most of the dreams or visions that Swedenborg records assume a symbolic form and have to be reinter­ preted by him to attain the nature of divine apparitions. Tafel has explained at length that these new interpretations almost always accord with those found later in his biblical exegesis and in his Spiri­ tual Diary,l59 The visionary period thus becomes a preparatory school for the later supernatural relations and for Swedenborg's biblical exegesiS. The sudden interruption of the Journal of Dreams does not allow us to follow Swedenborg's internal evolution during this period of crisis to the end. We learn only by secondhand accounts of the grand vision that was the decisive confirmation of the mission God com­ manded him to fulfill. 152"

One day, Robsahm tells us, he demanded of him \"where and how it had been given to him to see and to hear what takes place in the world of spirits, in heaven and in hell.\" Sweden borg replied: I was in London and dined rather late at an inn where I was in the habit of dining, and where I had my own room. My thoughts were engaged on the subjects we have been discussing. I was hungry and ate with a good appetite. Towards the close of the meal I noticed a sort of dimness before my eyes; this became denser, and I then saw the floor covered with the most horrid crawling reptiles, such as snakes, frogs, and similar creatures. I was amazed; for I was perfectly conscious, and my thoughts were clear. At last the darkness increased still more; but it disap­ peared all at once, and I then saw a man sitting in a corner of the room. As I was then alone, I was very much frightened at his words, for he said: \"Eat not so much.\" All became black again before my eyes, but immediately it cleared away, and I found myself alone in the room. Such an unexpected terror hastened my return home; I did not let the landlord notice anything; but I considered well what had happened, and could not look upon it as a matter of mere chance, or as if it had been produced by a physical cause. I went home; and during the night the same man revealed himself to me again, but I was not frightened now. He then said that He was the Lord God, the Creator and Redeemer of the world, and that He had chosen me to explain to men the spiri­ tual sense of Scripture; and that He himself would explain to me what I should write on this subject. That same night were also opened to me, so that I became thoroughly convinced of their reality, the world of spirits, heaven, and hell, and I recognized there many acquaintances from many conditions of life. From that day I gave up the study of all worldly science, and labored 153"

Afterwards the Lord opened, daily very often, my bodily eyes so that in the middle of the day I could see into the other world and in a state of perfect wakefulness converse with angels and spirits. A letter addressed by Gabriel Beyer to C.P. Nordenskjold on March 25, 1776, adds some details to Robsahm's description of the second appearance by God on the same night. Beyer writes: The account of the personal appearance of God to Assessor Swedenborg, who saw him clad in purple and bathed in a ma­ jestic clarity, seated near the bed while he assigned his mission to Assessor Sweden borg, was made to me by the latter himself, and during a luncheon at the home of Dr. Rosen, where I saw the old man for the first time. I recall asking him how long the vi­ sion lasted to which he replied, \"about a quarter of an hour\"; and asked also if that brilliant light had not hurt his eyes, to which he answered in the negative. 161 Swedenborg's first great biblical commentary (Adversaria IV, §§ 1956--1957) alludes to the same occasion, as Tafel indicates.1 62 In his exegesis of Exodus 8, where God subjects Egypt to an invasion of frogs, Sweden borg states that these represent the most impure spirits who rule the lowest in man and arouse the lusts of the body and blood, particularly the voluptuosity of taste. They are of different aspects: creatures of this sort appeared to me one day arising [from my­ self] and thus so distinctly that I saw them crawling before my eyes. They suddenly compacted together and turned into flames, collapsing with a crackling that sounded in my ears like the noise of their explosion. After which the area appeared cleansed. This happened to me in London in April 1745. A kind of fog ex­ uded from my pores, and the floor was covered by a multitude of crawling reptiles. 154"

It was also at that time when Swedenborg reports the opening of his \"spiritual sight.\"163 But this also adds considerable interest to an another viewpoint. It clarifies the quite confused relations in Robsahm's account between the vision of crawling things on the floor and the vision that orders Sweden borg not to eat so much. We now perceive much more clearly the agreement of this vision with the appearance of Jesus Christ that Sweden borg had experienced a year earlier. Here also the vision be­ gins with the flight of the tempter with a loud noise. Herrlin seeks to explain in part the deep impression made on Swedenborg by this vi­ sion by the fact that it constitutes \"his first true hallucination.\"164 It is naturally difficult to draw any solid conclusions from these secondhand accounts, but they seem to me to confirm Herrlin's view. Swedenborg insists that he was absolutely conscious and in full pos­ session of his senses, although he usually relates in his journal that his visions occur in an intermediate state between sleep and wakefulness. He seems to locate the apparition in his external sense organs. Rob­ sahm's account mentions Swedenborg's \"bodily eyes,\" and the fact that Beyer asks if his eyes were not dazzled by the radiant apparition shows that Sweden borg had described his vision to them in analo­ gous terms. What is even more remarkable is that Sweden borg sees the objects in their true spatial environment; the reptiles crawl over the floor, the human figure appears in a corner of the room. To these typical characteristics, which indicate that it is truly a matter of a psy­ chosensory hallucination, is added the terror that the apparition pro­ vokes in Swedenborg. As I have already indicated, this powerful emotive reaction is characteristic of true hallucination, especially on its first occurrence. It is precisely the clearly characterized nature of perception and the manifest reality of this vision that explains why Swedenborg found in it the definitive confirmation of his relations with a higher world and of his religious mission. The very words spoken by the apparition, however trivial they may have seemed to certain psychia­ trists who have often made fun of them, were of a character appro­ priate to preparing him for the call that was to follow in the course of the nocturnal vision.

This vision, then, was for Swedenborg the external sign mark­ ing the end of the inner struggle within him. In a form that seemed to him to leave no room for doubt, he acquired a conviction about God's intentions for him. All the realms of the spirit were opened to his eyes. He learned that his mission would be henceforth to apply the internal sense of the biblical word and that God would help him in that attempt. And what is perhaps the most important is that he thereby renounced the exercise of \"all worldly learning\" in order to devote himself to labor \"in spiritualibus.\" From that moment, he is certain of the way he will follow. It is this final certitude that furnishes the theological period of Swedenborg, the last of his life, with its character of conscious calm and harmony. No doubt he is still the prey of temptations emanating from malicious spirits during this period, but these are transitory tri­ als he feels are in order because he is the chosen instrument of God. The visions and apparitions continue, but they have entirely lost the ecstatic and violently emotional character that they had in his Journal of Dreams. There is an infinite abyss between the calm narration Sweden­ borg gives of his tribulations in the world of spirits in his Spiritual Diary, in the Arcana Coelestia, and other works of his theological pe­ riod, and the feverish descriptions in the Journal of Dreams. Doubt and anguish have given way to a serene faith and to its own dogmas, a faith that risks seeming to most of his readers all too categorical and sure of itself. The weak mystic at times seems transformed into an aggressive theologian who brandishes the bolts of anathema and con­ demnation in passionate polemic. At times when he seeks to guide his fellow man in the right way, he appears to forget the struggles he ex­ perienced during his own religious crisis.

From this view, deeply tinged with Quietism, he is to re­ turn to the doctrine, already expounded in the Economy of the Animal Kingdom, of the possibility-and obligation-for each person to con­ tribute to the work of salvation by his or her own strength. Sweden­ borg's notion of \"new birth\" as a victory over sins and vices acquired by a slow and purposeful regeneration of character and by a virtuous life is in absolute contradiction with the situation that he describes in the Journal of Dreams: for here he reaches a stage where he continu­ ally awaits transformation into another man by a sudden influx of grace from God and where his ardent desire is to become an instru­ ment of which God will make use at his good pleasure. In reality, this development is quite explicable psychologically, and it has been observed by a good number of mystics. In his work, which I cited previously, Leuba regards it as characteristic of Chris­ tian mysticism and has confirmed its existence in St. Teresa, Tauler, Mme. Guyon, and others. He claims that the common trait of the great Christian mystics is not merely a tendency toward passive renunciation of selfhood, but also a tendency that seems directly antagonistic to the former-an expansive and practical drive toward a moral ideal. It is true that mystics seek to annihilate their own egos and isolate themselves from the external world. But these are tenden­ cies that especially dominate in periods of crisis. For them, there is a need to combat the \"natural\" within themselves, in other words, to free themselves from physical needs and desires and therefore also from all the external impressions that threaten to distract them from the supreme goal they pursue: the mystic union with divinity. But once this goal is achieved, and from the day when they feel themselves to have become instruments of God and consider that they have finally killed their own \"I,\" they have, in reality, resur­ rected it. Their isolation ceases and they rejoin social life with all their energy as reformers or religious organizers. The spiritual process they have undergone has killed all egocentric instincts and imbued them with altruistic tendencies. \"Passer de la volonte pro pre a la volonte divine signifie passer de la volonte particuliere a la volonte 157"

I would even say that it applies perhaps better to Swedenborg than to any of the other mystics Leuba studied. For this practical and expansive aspect of mysticism was rightly and distinctively marked in the temperament of the great Swedish mystic. During his scientific period, there is not a single one of his works that fails to indicate in its introduction the practical end he pursues and that does not aim to provide a useful moral doctrine for humankind. Even in the moral crisis of the Journal of Dreams, one sees the dawn of a desire to let humanity know what he himself has experienced and to share with his kind the unshakable faith that fills his heart. And when he has surmounted his inner combat, it appears evident to him that he must consecrate the rest of his life to the reli­ gious apostolate. It is only natural that, from the day he considers himself obliged to guide the world towards the way of the \"new birth,\" Sweden borg should resort to the account of his own conversion. This conversion seemingly appeared to him in a different light after he had recovered his interior harmony. Besides, he hardly had any impulse to compare his own religious experiences with others like him. On the contrary, he never ceases to affirm that he has been a special object of divine grace. In his memoir, Robsahm relates that he asked him one day whether it were possible for anyone else to attain \"the degree of spir­ ituality\" that he had acquired, to which Swedenborg replied, \"Take care; that is a direct road to insanity: for when a man pores over spiritual and hidden things, he cannot protect himself against the delusions of hell.\" And he adds that he himself had never thought that he would reach \"that spiritual state in which I am now.\"166 This is why he recommends to others the way of salvation that he considers the shortest and most practical: the path of conscious ed­ ucation of the will. His basic view remains the one he has inherited from his father and that he later defended in one of his works: to know that the essence of Christianity resides, not in the dogmas of faith, but in a pure life.

There is no question here of an allegorical commentary on the creation story found in Genesis, but rather of a partly scientific and partly poetical paraphrase of that creation-a sort of creational fiction; as such, it is the incomparably most beauti­ ful we have. The mythical mode of representation had always been dear to Swedenborg. An innate tendency to anthropomorphize all things, to clothe them in a sensory form, was supplemented by his knowledge of classical mythology, of Ovid and Plato; fundamentally, it is an ex­ pression of that poetic bent that contributed to Sweden borg's belief in a spiritual realm. This poetic bent was to be transferred by his over­ flowing imagination to the structure of the various worlds of spirit and to his explorations of the planets of our solar system. The brief exposition I have given of the philosophy of the Principia cannot pro­ vide an appreciation of the extent to which Sweden borg had recourse to the mythical style of narration. Merely raising the question of whether Swedenborg had drawn his first idea of the creation of the moon and of the planets at the ex­ pense of the solar nebula from Ovid's Metamorphoses is sufficiently eloquent in itself.168 In any case, this theory was expounded in the Principia in direct relation with the cosmogonic myths of antiquity. Using a quotation from The Birds of Aristophanes-the famous ac­ count of how the black-winged Night lays a wind egg from which Eros, the creator of the universe, was born-and by an account of the creation in the Metamorphoses, Swedenborg seeks, in the ancient fable of the universal egg, a historical precedent for his own theory. Ac­ cording to this concept, the sun was originally surrounded by a crust whose debris, projected into space, formed the various planets at the time the sun itself broke out of its chaotic state (Principia III, §395). Further on, when he shows how the universe is born from the sun, Swedenborg turns to the same mythological concept. The in­ fants to whom Phoebus gave life begin by frolicking around their parent; but, upon attaining the age of youth, they break away from him, each to settle into his own orbit. They nonetheless remain under 161"

They pay him homage at dawn and at dusk, for it is from him that they have received their life and that they continue to receive it day by day; and he likewise always retains a paternal authority over them (Principia III, §398). We then follow the evolution of the earth, a naked infant at first, to become a radiant virgin, clothed in ether, and to break away from her father Phoebus in her turn (Principia III, §411). We fi­ nally leave her, in adulthood and completely clothed, during the course of the Golden Age, the era of Paradise. For Swedenborg re­ turns to his favorite notion in the last chapter: when she was closest to the sun, the earth was a veritable paradise. The entire terrestrial globe constituted an immense garden. The empire of the sun, of which Plato spoke in Phaedo, the garden of the Hesperides beyond the seas, the Eden of the Bible, were then realities. Nature was in its infancy, playful and smiling. Flora and Ceres rested upon their couches of herbs; Diana ranged the forests followed by her nymphs. Jupiter, Phoebus, and the other gods lived among humans and kept gallant rendezvous in every grove. Pluto himself from the darkness of Tartarus rose to earth to kidnap Proserpine; Venus and her son were constantly at war (Principia III, §448). Almost all of the mythical passages of the Principia have been used, as we shall see, in The Worship and Love of God. Even the ele­ giac description of the sojourn of the ancient gods on earth in ancient Greece in human form is found again in the introduction of the work. It was more difficult to find a place for the element of fable in the psychological analysis of the Economy of the Animal Kingdom. Even here, however, Swedenborg's poetic tendency to crystallize his spiritual concepts into vivid mythological scenarios appears from time to time. And this propensity for mythical transformation finds a theoretical basis in the doctrine of correspondences and representa­ tives. The spiritual only becomes intelligible to us when it is pre­ sented in a form within reach of our senses. Every earthly phenomenon is a mere symbol of a spiritual phenomenon, a kind of allegorical drama that acquires its deep significance only for the per­ son able to interpret the symbols. 162"

We have already seen that, in the Principia, Swedenborg al­ lowed himself to ponder mystical considerations on the integrity of Adam's psychic functions before the Fall. This theory of the continu­ ity of our psychic life, of a bond that unites us with the Divinity and permits us to behold the supersensory world, a bond broken at the moment of the Fall, is glimpsed through the psychological structure of the Economy of the Animal Kingdom. During the entire latter half of his scientific period, Sweden borg had persevered in trying to re­ construct this bond to achieve intuitive knowledge and that aware­ ness of union with divinity characteristic of the first humans. This aspiration led to his first mystic experiences, the moments of \"pene­ trations\" coming to him by flashes. And this whole period of peni­ tence that we have followed through the Journal of Dreams is an extended effort to recover, while combating the allure of the senses· and renouncing all intellectual travail, the innocence of the first man and to become worthy to receive the irradiation of divine light. Sweden borg finally attained his goal. The extent to which he identifies his new state with that of Adam before the fall appears in a particularly clear fashion in his initial comments on the story of cre­ ation in Historia creation is a Mose tradita (1743) where he explains the state of Adam, the latter's conversations with God and angels, etc., by the experiences Swedenborg claims to have had himself. I cite as ex­ amples only the terms he uses in explaining that, in eating of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, the first couple ceased to live by heavenly influx and became the toys of their senses, con­ strained to seek knowledge by empirical experience: \"From the state which is ours when we are led by divine influx, and that not merely in thought but also in act and in the movements of the body, and how it is no longer permissible to act under the influence of caprices stim­ ulated by our lower psychic faculties, are things I have learned by the grace of God\" (Adversaria I, §18).

One easily perceives this close relationship in the fact that Sweden borg attributes to Adam and Eve several mys­ tical occurrences that he himself had experienced during his period of purification. Thus, Adam is seen to be the object of a state of ecstasy identical to that described in the Journal of Dreams; and Eve relates to the suspension of respiration in Sweden borg in order to not disturb her own thoughts and to give his anima full and entire freedom. Swedenborg's recent experience-that we are subject to the influence of spirits who insinuate themselves into our most intimate feelings and with whom we can exchange thoughts-is reflected in the con­ versations of Adam and Eve and in their psychic faculties, translated into the form of spirits, by the certitudes and heavenly intelligences that occupy the major part of the completed work. And the first human couple is likewise admitted, in the form of representative ac­ counts and expositions, to the knowledge of spirits of inferior quality in the service of the Prince of the World and of the animus. Here we find, reflected in a orderly but basically identical form, the dream life of the journal. It is evident that the work, in pursuit of such a vast objective, cannot adhere to the narrow range of biblical narration. Sweden borg was convinced that the Scriptures aimed at expounding how man, in­ stead of eating of the Tree of Life which offered him this knowledge that penetrates the anima from on high, ate of the Tree of Knowl­ edge, that is, sought knowledge to be acquired through the senses and science (cf. Historia Creationis I, § 17). Therefore, it obviously be­ came necessary to precede this account with an explanation of the psychic life of humanity like that in the Economy of the Animal King­ dom. And this exposition, in turn, is not intelligible unless one under­ stands the cosmological system structured by Sweden borg in the Principia. So, it was entirely natural that the latter work should inter­ vene in the new one to a considerable degree, especially since, in the Principia, Swedenborg had expounded upon the creation of the world; in most respects, he remains faithful to his earlier views. It is characteristic of Swedenborg that, even after his conversion during the period of the Journal of Dreams, he continues to regard his prior scientific works with real sympathy. Indeed, he believes that God has prepared him from the start for the mission he is destined to 164"

In a letter addressed to Getinger in 1766, he declares that he was first of all introduced by the Lord to natural science and that he thus underwent a preparation from 1710-1744, when the heavens were opened to his eyes.169 It is this intermediate stand between scientific exposition and pure poetry that makes it so difficult to give a general picture of the structure of The Worship and Love of God. I propose here, as an indispensable sequel, to give a brief glance at its contents, in the absence of which one could not form an idea of the true aims of the work and even less of its poetic values. In a grandiloquent introduction, the author relates that one au­ tumn day, walking lost in thought through a pleasant grove, he had seen dead leaves fall and was overcome by melancholy while musing on the succession of seasons. It had seemed to him that the earth itself had already outlived its infancy and adolescence-the ages of gold and silver-and now entered its last period, the age of iron. He re­ calls that the ancient sages, \"whose soul was more distinct from the body than ours, and thus nearer to heaven,\" had realized that ages nobler than their own had preceded them. They had known that, in the first age after creation, the gods had come down from their astral abode to enter into friendly relations with humans, that in that age the earth was only a great garden where perpetual springtime ruled and breathed its soft western breezes. It is in this setting that the an­ cients raised the curtain on the stage of our sensory world. For in the diverse series of acts on this theater, they saw in the living and the dead a clear image of universal order, according to which everything begins its existence in the spring or in infancy. And it is in this same way that the author seeks here to consider the very figure of the uni­ verse in the reflection of the things themselves and to sense the des­ tiny of times and ages. As we have previously pointed out, this exposition is taken whole from the closing chapter of the Principia, but the notions that provide the basis of the reasoning, the knowledge that the earth was once nearer to the sun and the home of eternal spring, were notably more ancient and reappear in the chronologically earliest works of Swedenborg (see chapter one). 165"

      "text": "EMAMUEL SWEDEN BORG: THE DEVELOPMENT OF HIS THOUGHT In the first chapter, when he takes up the creation of the world and describes the great universal egg, the yolk of which constitutes the sun, while the white germinates the earths that are later to form the various worlds, there is only a poetic paraphrase-adhering to Greek mythology-of the thesis he postulates in the Principia that all the planets and moons were formed by eruption of the solar nebula. And, in fact, we find here restated, in its smallest details, the cosmo­ logical mechanism of the Principia. Animal life issues from the veg­ etable, which arises in turn from the mineral, just as here he has the different kingdoms descending, one from the others, like so many eggs hatched in the heat of the sun. I shall not proceed further here into these cosmological theories, since, in the above-mentioned work, Stroh has most thoroughly es­ tablished their relationships with the Principia. But with ingenious imagination and with purely ancient coloration, Swedenborg ex­ pounds the various phases of the evolution of the universe. We watch the earth appear, after the creation of the vegetable kingdom, like a young bride adorned with the softest of budding roses, wearing a chaplet of the choicest blossoms, and inviting the heavenly guests to partake in her own boudoir of the first fruits she has brought. And we then see the crowns of the trees and the herbs of the soil achieve new generative power from the light of the sun and produce eggs, from which all the animal species are later born. It is by the same process, in even more solemn forms, that the first man is given birth. At that time, the entire earth was a paradise, lacking only a con­ scious being to enjoy its beauty, a creature able to perceive the heav­ enly paradise from the earth and gratefully worship the creator in acknowledgment (Worship and Love of God §30). In the most temper­ ate region of the terrestrial globe, there was an orchard of fruits so dense that the oblique rays of the sun were shaded. The orchard was traversed by numerous streams, whose evaporation was deposited on the undersides of the foliage and maintained a perpetual dew on the surface of the turf. At the center of this \"paradise within paradise\" arose a fruit tree, the Tree of Life, bearing an egg in which nature had concealed its most precious treasures (The Worship and Love of God §32). When nature had finished creating this egg, it was fertil­ ized by the supreme mind (suprema mens); indeed, this supreme 166"

In this anima, emanating from the supreme mind, a spark of sacred fire burned, a spark desiring to be let down on its wings from the cloudy citadel on which it was seated towards the lowest things of the earth. From here, after having sensorily tasted the joys of earth and transformed these into beatitudes ifelicitates), it would return to its heavenly domi­ cile to tell of these delights (Worship and Love o/God §§33-34). Let me note, in passing, how clear the Neoplatonic stamp is in this view. The soul who, in its supersensory world, was a part of the universal soul, is driven by an internal force to lower itself into the world below. But it is only to reascend to a higher world that her knowledge of a lower one has taught her to appreciate po The very concept of the wings of the soul is found several times in Plotinus, who had it from Plato. Nevertheless, in Swedenborg, this motivation relates only to the first human soul. This soul has engendered the other souls. And here Swedenborg alludes, as before, to his accept­ ance of pre-existence. The anima, itself the effigy of the supreme mind, by its radiation undertakes to form a microcosm in the bosom of this egg structured from the macrocosm. In this process, all nature was a docile auxiliary. The egg receives its sap, not only from the Tree of Life, but also from all the trees of the orchard. The sun dares not cast its rays directly on this egg, which radiate from spiritual light, but must let it be first moderated through the fruits. The vernal west wind blows without reaching the egg, lest the beginning of tissue formation be aborted. The surrounding vegetation spreads its branches like so many arms to lighten the burden on the leaf-sheltered mother, while other branches prepare a cradle cushioned by tufts gathered from the cot­ ton plants. And nature is not alone in cooperating in this creation of humanity; heaven-dwelling spiritual minds (mentes spirituales) have been sent to the aid of nature. They guard the access to the sacred wood; and when wild beasts overstep the prescribed boundary, they are seized with a sudden terror and flee or kneel as though to wor­ ship their Lord and King. As the hour approaches, the parturient branch inclines by degrees toward the earth; the newborn frees itself 167"

Flowers ex­ hale their softest perfumes; heavenly choirs let the delicate vibrations of their effulgence shimmer in the infant's eyes to prevent any other light than theirs from kindling the first spark of the light of his life. And at the first rays of the sun, they begin a paradisiacal dance of joy in honor of the newborn (Worship and Love of God §§39-40). The narrative proceeds in the same symbolic manner, with the creation and development of the human body, of its senses and its intellectual faculties under the guidance of the anima: a passage it is unnecessary to elaborate upon further, since we already know Swedenborg's theo­ ries on the formation of knowledge; these are found here without any variant. The images that receive their forms from solar light trans­ form the soul and direct it first toward material ideas and finally to­ ward intellectual ideas. It retains these thoughts in the memory and creates intelligence therefrom. It raises its own daughters to make them participants in its light and love. To the degree that they under­ stand and assimilate this life, they become \"certitudes.\" These intelli­ gences and these certitudes form the mens of the newborn. Once Adam reaches adulthood, the anima lays down its scepter, however, and retires into the cerebellum, which is its normal seat. The newborn awakens one fine day to find himself no longer an infant but an adolescent, able to converse with his \"intelligences.\" He is appointed king by these intelligences and arranges a contest of wis­ dom among them (Worship and Love of God §§SO-S4). However, he does not succeed in learning from them the source of all the good and useful which, independent of the truths, flows into his brain. He real­ izes that this does not reach him by way of the senses but by an inter­ nal and mysterious route. He meditates on these things almost to the point of seeing the doors of his reason torn from their hinges and chaos introduced into the places where his \"intelligences\" reside. Then he is suddenly snatched from himself and perceives his certitudes in the bosom of supreme love and his intelligences in conversation with divine beings. As though he awakens from a dream, he becomes aware that he has looked into the sanctuary from which all good emanates. At that 168"

Once these words are pronounced, burning with the ardent de­ sire to know what his human intelligences have learned from their heavenly intelligences, he feels as if he is being suddenly torn from himself and transported to the very heart of love amidst a choir of ce­ lestial beings. When he seeks in vain to cast himself to earth, he hears words uttered in his deepest self (Worship and Love of God §§S4-SS. This ecstatic manifestation conforms, point by point, to the visions of Jesus Christ experienced by Swedenborg, as detailed in the preceding chapter. Love-for it is Love that speaks-then announces to Adam that it is the source of all good, that the love, of which he is the object, is a reflux of his own love and reflection of divine love. He is warned that he must not drink from the fount of selfhood. In order that he may distinguish what belongs to him, a tree has been planted in the center of the garden, whose initial root issued from a heavenly germ, but which later put down its own roots. Adam is urged by Love not to eat of the fruit of this tree, but to seek his nourishment in love. And finally a paradise opens to the eyes of the first man, compared to which his own paradise is but a shadow. When the vision ends, a cloud covers Adam's eyes, his sight fails just as when we pass sud­ denly from the most brilliant light to darkness (Worship and Love of God §§S4-SS). Distracted, the first man awakens in the same place as he was in before his vision and imagines that he has fallen from his heights and lost all contact with heaven. Nevertheless, one of his wisdoms con­ soles him. He still dwells in the bosom of God, and only the veil that covers his eyes impedes him from seeing heaven. It is within our­ selves that heaven is found, in our anima, but we can be aware of this only when the light of the anima penetrates to our mens (Worship and Love of God §S6). In the following chapter, Swedenborg shows us the first-born being visited by heavenly beings in whose company he has previously seen his intelligences. They approach him in the form of nude damsels, their tresses held by golden clasps, their foreheads circled by precious stones and garlands of flowers that join them together. They 169"

During his conversation with his intelligences, Adam learns that our soul is exposed to two influences, one from the heavenly sun and the other from the natural sun; and that there are two kinds of love, one emanating directly from God, which draws us upward, and one coming from the world, which separates us from divinity. These two loves confront each other in the mens, which becomes the arena of their combat. We recognize these theories, having found them already in Economy of the Animal Kingdom. The sole difference is that they are here clothed in a mythological Christian form. God himself, who cre­ ated heaven and earth and sustains their various degrees, gave rise on our earth to a source of life of infinite flow; in other words, he created a ruler of the world and of spirits subject to him. This Prince of the World became so proud of the power conferred upon him by God that he rebelled against God and against his only Son. The Prince has two chiefs under his orders, Amor sui and Amor mundi (the love of self and love of the world), who, in turn, command their satraps, subal­ terns, and centurions, each of whom are surrounded by innumerable lictors. They command diverse kingdoms, provinces, or dominions. The Supreme would have been able to destroy the universe by a single nod of his will and thrust the tyrants into Tartarus along with all the souls of their subjects. Inflamed in righteous anger, he was armed with thunderbolts. But the very moment when about to hurl these bolts, his only-begotten Son interposed himself between the ad­ versaries, embracing those human minds and barely escaping being torn in pieces by the fury of the infernal dog. Fearing to hit his only Son, the Supreme laid aside his bolts and, on the plea of his Son to spare these ignorant and guiltless beings or allow him to perish along with them, the Most Holy Parent promised to indulge the world until it has passed through its sequence of seasons and falls into its sleep of eternal winter. He also gave the Savior power to loose or bind his enemy at his pleasure. Since that moment, the latter's power has been restricted within narrow boundaries, and the children of hu­ manity enjoy a life naturally mingled with death (Worship and Love of God §§69-78). 170"

      "text": "THE WORSHIP AND LOVE OF GOD By this mythological exposition, Swedenborg seeks, as he also explicitly declares in his work, to symbolize the internal struggle that is pursued in the depth of the human being, between worldly lust and heavenly love and the struggle between the external and internal per­ son. The anima represents the Almighty (Mens Suprema) and rules as a goddess in its tiny sphere; it is from her that all life proceeds. The mens, with its understanding and its will represents Love itself, or the only Son of the Most High, whose image it is. The animus represents the Prince of the World (Worship and Love a/God §70). This is not just a matter of symbolism. Here we are little worlds and consequently carry the earth and the heavens within us, that is, the kingdom of God. God the Father truly exists in our anima, with his life; his only Son and his love, in our mens; and Prince of the World with his own life, in our animus. The latter is chained by our love, which closes the door of our mens to it; and as far as we are led by this love, not only can the Evil One not act upon us, but is entirely in our power. In reality, the Prince of the World is forced to present himself before Adam and, at his behest, take on the various disguises under which he is in the habit of deceiving humanity. Now he ap­ pears as a dog, now in the form of a dragon, of a flame, etc. (Worship and Love a/God §81). In sum, these are the same forms under which the devil appeared to Sweden borg in his dreams. In the second part of the book, Sweden borg writes similarly of Eve and her education and marriage. The first man was asleep in a grove, several furlongs distant from the one in which he had seen daylight himself, at the center of which there was also an apple tree, as beautiful as the Tree of Life. Resting upon his flowery bed, he per­ ceives in a dream a radiantly beautiful nymph, at the sight of whom he feels himself suffused with glowing warmth. But when, smitten with love, he attempts to enfold her in his arms, she eludes his em­ brace like a bright cloud. Vehemently inflamed, he tries to catch her, but the area of his rib cage is distended to the point that it seemed to him that one of his ribs has just been fractured. Finally, when he suc­ ceeds in grasping her and covering her lips with kisses, he awakens and to his great chagrin perceives that all was but a dream. He was not aware that the tree under which he had slept bore an egg similar to the one from which he had been born, and that it was the branch 171"

Never­ theless, he has a vague impression of having been led to this place by a divine impulse, and he has a presentiment that what he has seen in a dream will finally appear to him (Worship and Love of God §§87-88). From this fertilized egg Eve is born. Under the tutelage of heaven, she grows into a maiden whose face radiates the purest inno­ cence so that she seems to be a celestial grace in human form. All the motions of her soul are reflected in her features in colorations from white to purplish shades; for during this period of innocence, her an­ imus is entirely submissive to the dominance of the mens, and her body is consequently a faithful mirror of her soul (Worship and Love of God §89). One day, during her adolescence, she finds herself near a foun­ tain. As she bends over its crystalline surface, she perceives, to her amazement, an image, a face that reproduces her motions, and her own ivory-white breasts, arms, and hands. She is astonished to see in this countenance the tracings of the image of her thoughts that have crossed her own mind. She betakes herself quickly to her celestial governesses and asks for an explanation of this phenomenon. The heavenly being who conducts the choir reveals that the face is only the mirror of the soul (Worship and Love of God §90). Eve now learns, as Adam did, the inner and outer qualities of the human creature and the use to which it is assigned in the uni­ verse. (I pass over these considerations, which we have already found in Sweden borg's earlier philosophy.) She is finally instructed about her future husband. The celestial nuptial attendants unbind her hair, which falls to her shoulders in ringlets, there forming a golden ring. They affix a crown of diamonds. When the young bride, who does not yet realize her vocation very clearly, perceives him who is her des­ tiny, her cheeks turn purple with a flame of love, and she is trans­ formed into a naked heavenly Grace. When the first man who, since his vision, has been unable to divert his thoughts from the adorable nymph, perceives her amid the angelic choir, he realizes with joy the one whom heaven had shown him in his dream as wife and conjugal companion (Worship and Love of God §§109-110). 172"

It begins with a very beautiful description of the wedding night, during which nature, herself in full spring blossom, appears to invite the young couple to bind their new ties. Warmed by the same flame, both mutually confirm their faith with kisses and their young love grows into a consuming flame. This love is a rebirth for them, the beginnings of a new life. From that moment they realize all their pleasures in common; all that charms the senses of one of this pair likewise charms the senses of the other. This intimate communion purifies and exalts their joy, \"so that the vein of all delights inflowed into a heart as it were united, but divided into two chambers\" (Wor­ ship and Love of God § 111). But then, In the early morn when Aurora sent forth on high into the at­ mosphere of heaven the rays of the rising sun like arrows tinged with gold, they both awoke from a most sweet sleep in the con­ jugal couch which they had shared; for a kind of heavenly light­ ening glanced over their eyes, driving away rest and drawing the attention of both away from each other and to itself. (Wor­ ship and Love of God § 112) A vision of the universe and of its evolution is offered to their eyes as clear as the light of day. Here Swedenborg perspicuously condenses his entire philosophy of nature and his theory of creation. It is at first a vision of the spiritual sun, whose light is so brilliant that the two spouses are constrained to close their eyes. Through their closed eye­ lids, they nevertheless perceive that this sun has spread its rays, in de­ creasing splendor, across the entire universe. And they then see the birth of all creation up to the moment where, at the center of the sun, the human form rises and is swept up into heaven. Following this vision, the young couple discusses what interpre­ tation they should form about it. Here we find, for the most part, still in a more concentrated form, what we know from the preceding de­ scription of the creation. We find expressed here, as Stroh observed in his above-mentioned study, the key concept of the work that pro­ vided his title: that one draws near to God in the measure that one 173"

We can, however, form an idea of the fundamental traits under which Swedenborg had conceived the sequence of this work, by his first attempt at allegorical commentaries on Genesis published in 1745-the same year as Worship and Love of God-under the title Historia creation is a Mose tradita. 17l As I have already pointed out, he there in effect compares his preceding book to Holy Scripture and confirms the concordance between the two. It does not seem venture­ some, then, to conclude that the interpretation of the creation se­ quence given by Swedenborg here also accords with the exposition he had intended to make in The Worship and Love of God. In the Historia Creation is, the Fall of humankind is regarded as arising from the fact that Adam and Eve, who up to that point had received all their knowledge from the anima-that is a priori­ turned away, under the sway of the serpent, representing the Prince of the World, from divine influx. Thereafter, they sought knowledge a posteriori and opened themselves to the influx from nature and were animated by self-love. This is symbolized by the eating of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge, for this tree and its fruit represent the intelli­ gence acquired through the senses. From the day Adam and Eve taste the fruit of this tree, then, they cease to live a heavenly life and begin to live a natural one. They become aware of their nakedness-that is, they perceive the gaps in natural intellect. In the words regarding the future pains of women, Swedenborg sees a prediction of the struggle between heavenly and natural instincts, which began in us at that moment. To prevent the fallen humanity from tasting the fruits of the Tree of Life, that is, to keep nature and its desires from intruding into the anima, God ban­ ishes Adam and Eve from paradise; in other words, he closes the anima to the influences of the lower faculties of the mind. The cheru­ bim who guard the tree have the mission to oppose the intrusion of the natural into the spiritual. The flaming sword symbolizes worldly desires; while their flame burns within human nature, we cannot enter heaven. It is only by the coming of the Messiah-a prophecy of which, with the Apocalypse, Swedenborg sees in the words announc­ ing that the posterity of the woman will crush the head of the 174"

In an addendum, Swedenborg gives us to understand that Gen­ esis should be more particularly related to the Messiah and his future realm, the celestial Jerusalem. For our entire earth was created only for heaven, and God wished that our terrestrial life should be a preparation for the kingdom of the heavens. It is necessary, then, that the first creation represent the supreme end for our earth and our race. From the finished parts of The Worship and Love of God, it seems clear to me that Sweden borg had the idea of a plan analogous to that of the Historia Creation is. A number of passages in The Wor­ ship and Love of God surely indicate that it is thus that he had con­ ceived the explanation of the Fall. And the analogy of conception of the original, which we find again in the preface to Principia and later in Economy of the Animal Kingdom, with works of the same period becomes strikingly manifest. But it is also beyond doubt that, when he wrote The Worship and Love of God, he already intended to ex­ pound not only how humankind lost our earthly paradise and sev­ ered relations with the Divinity, but also how the restoration of these relations would be made possible by the intervention of Jesus Christ; moreover, how humanity, in the New Jerusalem, achieves the supreme purpose of creation, the reunion with God. The very title The Worship and Love of God would be grossly inadequate had Swedenborg wished only to describe the original creation and the Fall. To give an idea of the fundamental significance of The Worship and Love of God, I have had to neglect the long dialogues between the first human couple and the spirits, although these take up the major part of the book. Their detailed study could only lead to repetition. From Economy of the Animal Kingdom and other contemporary works, in fact, we know almost all the teachings already; indeed, cer­ tain phrases are even reproduced textually. Nevertheless, on certain points, Swedenborg enlarges his conceptions in a sense that foreshad­ ows his theology. It is thus that he clearly develops the thesis of God as the sole living being acting in the universe, a thesis already expounded in 175"

No more than the eye can see unless it is lighted by the sun is our mind capable of understanding if it is not irradiated by the spiritual sun. All things created are only or­ gans without activity of their own, unless an external force acts upon them. The divine Wisdom declares to Adam that nothing is thine own which thou supposest to be thine own. Thou are only a power potential, which from itself or from its own, never performs any action. But thou art a power more noble than all created powers .... Both heaven and earth inflow into thee with their treasures and gifts, but they are outside of thee; thou receivest these things, and actest as from borrowed forces. (Worship and Love o/God §58) When Adam objects that he seems to have freedom of will, the Wis­ dom replies that this will itself is, in each of his acts, governed by the end of our love. He adds in a beautiful analogy: Didst thou not observe lately the cock-dove up above the tops of our trees and how violently he beat the air with his wings? He beheld his consort dove and the nest which contained her young: This was the reason for his swift flight. It seemed to him that he himself vibrated his wings and chose the shortest way home, but in reality his loves, his fledged young and his mistress excited his mind and his mind moved his wings .... The case is similar in ourselves; our loves, whatever their number, hold the reins and excite and govern our minds; by them we are drawn and them we follow; and inasmuch as we follow we seem to act, because we vibrate the wings of our mind accordingly, and use the winged feet of our body .... We suppose the decisions to be our own. Love is, as it were, the charioteer who holds the reins and governs it as horsemen do horses and darken our minds, and persuades us that we sit as chieftains or leaders in the chariot.

He ends by expressing in the mouth of Adam an ardent desire \"to no longer belong to myself, but to give myself to him.\" This is the prayer that often rises to Sweden­ borg's lips at the time of his journal. However dependent the will of our love may be at times, it is this, and not our mind, that fashions our destiny, not only on this earth but also in the future life. Already at the time of his Journal of Dreams, Sweden borg was becoming more and more attracted to the concept (which is to appear later in such a marked form in his theol­ ogy) that it is not intellect that guides the will, but the will that guides intellect. Will is the primary factor while intellect is secondary (c£ Divine Love and Wisdom §244 and Arcana Coelestia §1515). In The Worship and Love of God, Swedenborg illustrates these relationships between mind and will when developing his symbol of the spiritual sun. From the light shed from this sun, the intellectual sight, comprehension of truth, is born, while the heat this same sun radiates is love, the origin of all sentiment of good (Worship and Love of God §63). Light and heat are distinct from each other and can exist separately. We are capable of understanding truth and thereby of dis­ tinguishing good; but the faculty of feeling and of being affected thereby does not proceed from light, but from heat. Our mind is like a garden. If sunlight does not accompany its heat, it remains as pow­ erless as the winter sun. Leaves wither and fruits fall, the mind is plunged into darkness, and our will is reduced to impotence. On the other hand, if heat is joined with light, it is spring and summer; everything revivifies, germinates, and flourishes. These are the blos­ soms of verities and goods that expand in the mens (Worship and Love of God §§62, 63, 67). As Stroh remarks, this description is found again point by point in Swedenborg's theological works.172 Thus, all the stages of our life depend exclusively on the state of our love. And this state depends on which of the amores of our mind is preponderant (see chapter six). Like a divinity, or like the very soul of our energies, it directs our little world completely, at times with an unsteady hand. Once this love has instructed our mens, everything proceeds indirectly from this. Since this love is destined to provide 177"

For every love that becomes predominant with humankind is counted as the supreme love and thus gathers the mind into its snares (Worship and Love of God §68). We see here clearly pointed up the doctrine of De Anima and of the Journal of Dreams (see chapter six) on the amor regnans, which later is to play such a great role in the theological works, particularly in the descriptions of the future life. The conclu­ sion, then, is that \"it is the life of our love that we live, and that our life is such as love is\" (Worship and Love of God §80). By a tentative systematic introduction of Christian mythology with his conceptions of the universe, Swedenborg deviates to a cer­ tain extent from the doctrines of Economy of the Animal Kingdom and contemporary works. We have seen that, when he speaks in his jour­ nal, for the first time, of the divine mission given to him to write a \"divine book on the worship and love of God\" he has already begun to understand something about spirits; \"believed I had something about this in my book De Infinito. But, to this, no answer was made\" (Journal of Dreams §250; cf. chapter six above). I have previously indicated that, in the work in question and in the works of the same period, Sweden borg had already given to un­ derstand that he wanted to pursue the scale of beings created beyond the limits of our natural universe and had acknowledged the exis­ tence of angels and spirits as mediators of divine providence. In real­ ity, one can be sure that belief in these supernatural beings had always been a part of his views, as it was with most of his contemporaries. Many statements on the nature of angels are found in Economy of the Animal Kingdom as he developed his theory of correspondences, which gave him the certitude of a spiritual world analogous to ours; and he was led to speculate more and more on the existence of super­ sensory beings and their relations with ourselves. I shall limit myself to referring the reader in this connection to my exposition of Swedenborg's conceptions, still very rudimentary in his earlier works, about conditions of life in the future world where we are to live as angels or spirits (see chapter five). As we have seen, it is only at the time of his religious crisis that Swedenborg considered himself to have entered personally into contact with the spiritual world. He 178"

I have indicated, when quoting these declarations (see chapter six) that Swedenborg has al­ ready entered into the order of ideas that are to follow him later dur­ ing his theosophical period: that angels and spirits act upon our thoughts and sentiments and that we carry in our most intimate selves a whole spiritual world where God and Satan strive against each other through their emissaries. This conception is more developed in Worship and Love of God, and here we find a formal doctrine of spirits. The knowledges and intelligences that comprise Adam's will and mind and together form the mens have a higher correspondence in the knowledges and intelli­ gences of heaven, as well as an inferior correspondence among the genii and spirits of the Prince of the World. These spirits of diverse nature have the faculty of penetrating into the person himself and acting on his functions: \"For heavenly beings, because they are spiri­ tual, have power of penetrating even into our inmosts, since nothing of nature can prevent it; for as they are in supreme things, so also they are in inmosts, yea, they even enter into a certain kind of association and discourse with the anima and the mens\" (Worship and Love of God §41). And likewise the spirits and genii of the Prince of the World can penetrate the physical desires of each person. Adam learns that, when the Prince of the World succeeds in enticing to his side the in­ telligences of the lowest sort of any mind, the gates of this soul are opened wide before him and he makes his entrance followed by his genii, expelling the knowledges and intelligences who betake them­ selves to flight like doves at the sight of a hawk. He then appoints a leader for his genii, whom he calls animus (Worship and Love of God §72). The subdivision of the world of spirits that Swedenborg estab­ lishes here accords precisely with that which we again discover in his theology, although the terminology differs somewhat. Thus, in Ar­ cana Coelestia we read: \"The angels who act into what is of man's will are called celestial, and they who act into what is of his understand­ ing are called spiritual. To the celestial are opposed genii, and to the spiritual the spirits\" (Arcana Coelestia §5878). 179"

The intelligences and certitudes that belong properly to Adam are expressly identified with the mens, with its will and its understanding. On the other hand, the heavenly knowledges and intelligences blend to a certain degree with the divine heat and light received through the mediation of the anima. Likewise, spirits and genii are to some extent identical with sensory knowledges and sensual desires. It is probably this fact that led Stroh, in his above-mentioned work,173 to object to the opinion according to which Sweden borg would have regarded his knowledges and intelligences as real spiri­ tual beings. The American author does not develop his thoughts; but, to judge from the references by which he seeks to refute their reality as spirits, it seems that he would consider the certitudes and the intel­ ligences of Adam as human faculties of the soul and their celestial correspondences as abstractions. Swedenborg's personification of them would, then, have only a poetical aim. This view seems to be confirmed to a certain extent by the fact that, in The Worship and Love of God, the psychic operations are per­ sonified. Yet Stroh's understanding is defensible only concerning the knowledges and intelligences that are designated as belonging to Adam. It is said expressly of these (Worship and Love of God §68, note m) that together they constitute the mens and that they are identical to the will and the understanding. And regarding another passage cited by Stroh (Worship and Love of God §53, note p), it is said that by Adam's conversation with his intelligences it should be understood that he talked with himself; that is, he was thinking. Other declara­ tions by Sweden borg could no doubt give rise to the belief that, in the latter's imagination, these entities had become in part independent spiritual beings, but the proof that he would consider them basically as faculties of the human soul is that he portrays them as being born from the anima. It is nevertheless impossible to deny that, in Swedenborg's mind, the knowledges and intelligences represent angels. He expressly declares so in several passages, notably in the sequence of citations made by Stroh. Besides, he characterizes them as inhabitants of heaven, as servants of the only Son of God. They are from God, live 180"

They differ from humans in that they have no body (Worship and Love of God § 1 06). However, Sweden borg does not doubt that they can appear to human beings in visible form. \"I take on the human form when I please and leave it alike,\" says one of the celestial beings to Eve (Worship and Love of God §95). Just like angels, spirits and genii are born by the very fact of creation. To create a bond between heaven and earth, God himself had a source of life born in the world. \"Such was the cause of the creation of a multitude of spirits and genii.\" (\"Haec Causa fuit creation is plurium spirituum ac geniorum, seu plurium essentiarum quae hic vivunt; Worship and Love of God §69). The whole description of the revolt of these spirits and genii against God under the leadership of the Prince of the World is, moreover, based on the biblical doctrine of the fall of the angels. To this interpretation it could be objected that, in a number of passages, Swedenborg speaks of celestial beings as divine forces, thoughts, and ends. It is superfluous to point out here, after the study we have made in the chapter regarding correspondences, the absolute concordance of this conception with the Neoplatonic ideas of SwedenborgP4 But this in no way implies that, in his mind, they do not possess any reality as supersensory beings. These ideas already had the benefit of this double situation among the ancient philoso­ phers by whom Swedenborg was inspired. We see the divine forces become spirits in Philo, who identifies them with the Mosaic angels. Plotinus pursues this thought and converts Platonic ideas into think­ ing spirits (voiJ. He describes demons who belong to a world inter­ mediate between ours and the intelligible world as entirely individualized living beings. They have a body of intelligible matter; they have sensory perceptions and language. But they are also con­ fused to a certain extent with human faculties. From among the demons who dominate human beings, each person chooses one as a guide. Allow me to point to the striking analogy of this conception with Sweden borg's doctrine, according to which we choose as our guide one of the \"amores\" which are found within each of us. We find even more manifest similarities between the Swedenborgian doctrine of the anima begetting its intelligences and the Plotinian doctrine of 181"

One chapter of The Theol­ ogy of Aristotle speaks of different kinds of spirits and their character­ istics. In the edition of this work that Swedenborg possessed, the commentator calls to mind that by \"spirits\" the author appears to refer to the celestial intelligences of which Aristotle speaks in his Metaphysics 176 and that these heavenly intelligences are hardly differ­ ent from our angels or demons. Our minds, hardly capable of con­ ceiving a bodiless thing, attribute the quality of spirits to entirely immaterial objects, as does popular belief. As we see, there is here not only an identification of celestial intelligences with the spirits of Christian mythology, but also a direct defense of the custom, com­ mon in every popular demonology, to objectify every spiritual po­ tency in the form of spirits. What appears even more to support the direct relationship of the Swedenborgian conception with The Theology of Aristotle is the fact that several years prior to The Worship and Love of God Sweden­ borg makes reference to celestial intelligence with particular regard to The Theology of Aristotle. In the Clavis, which dates from 1741, it is indeed a matter of \"spiritual intelligences, or of angels and souls\" who, because of their supernatural character, are born in possession of their full intelligence (Cia vis § 19). (This appears in the passage im­ mediately following the one previously cited-see chapter five above-where it is said that the ancient Egyptians already cultivated the doctrine of correspondences and that we have an entire book on the subject attributed to Aristotle.) We see thereby how, beginning with his visionary experiences, Swedenborg was naturally led to bring diverse kinds of spirits into his psychological system, laying ahead of time the essential founda­ tions of his spiritual doctrine. 182"

      "text": "THE WORSHIP AND LOVE OF GOD There is, however, a radical difference between this theory of spirits and the one we find in The Worship and Love of God. In Sweden borg's theological system, the angels, as well as good or evil spirits, represent the dead; since there were no dead in the time of Adam and Eve, it is evident that in The Worship and Love of God ce­ lestial beings, as well as spirits and genii, must be considered as hav­ ing been born from creation itself. There is a further consequence from this: evil spirits cannot be considered as having been created by God. Swedenborg is obliged to acknowledge a heavenly fall prior to ours. In his doctrine on the Prince of the World, he tries to reconcile the Christian belief in a personal devil with his Neoplatonic ideas and arrives at a conception which re­ calls, from rather far back, that of certain Church Fathers. The Prince of the World and his genii were created to serve as an intermediate link between heaven and earth, between the purely spiritual life and inert nature. For there is no more of a relationship between the purely spiritual life and nature than there is between light and shade. Sub­ jected by nature to divine orders, the Evil One gradually became cap­ tive of his love of self and of the world that had been subjected to his domination. And he developed the ambition to conquer heaven also; he rebelled against the Omnipotent. This revolt broke the bonds that united the Most High to nature (Worship and Love of God §129). From that time, the unique love emanating from the Most High and embrac­ ing the whole universe was replaced by two loves: the love of good, which seeks to unite the things of heaven with those of the earth, and the love of evil, which arises from hate and the desire to divide heaven and earth (Worship and Love of God §69). We thus have two original falls, and Jesus Christ was there to intervene twice as mediator. The whole Neoplatonic thesis of the rupture and reunion of nature with the infinite is consequently some­ what effaced, and the emanationist principle of God as the only living and acting substance, as spiritual sun, whose light constitutes the life and activity of the universe, loses something of its importance. It is found to be obscured, on the one hand, by the existence of the only Son, born from eternity (whose relationship with the Father Sweden­ borg has some difficulty in defining clearly), and on the other hand, by that of the Prince of the World, who, after having served as 183"

One can easily see that in order to unify his conception, Sweden­ borg is forced to eliminate the elements drawn from theological tra­ dition to come closer to the emanationist doctrine of Neoplatonism. And that is why, in the course of his theological period, he resolutely abandons the doctrine of the Trinity in its orthodox form and makes Jesus Christ an incarnation of God himself intervening at the begin­ ning of the evolution. It is for this same reason that he eliminates the dogma of a Fall prior to creation of the universe as well as the doc­ trine of a personal devil. Evil then arises consequent to the Fall ofhu­ manity, a fall that gives birth to hell. Humankind's apostasy and eventual reunion with the Divinity thus become the focus of his whole philosophy, during Swedenborg's theological period much more than previously, and becomes the fundamental problem around which all his theology crystallizes. Nevertheless, I believe I have established by my previous exposi­ tions that one may not consider The Worship and Love of God as a work intended exclusively to expound Swedenborg's philosophical and theological point of view in the form that he had adopted at that time. I have already indicated at the beginning of the present chapter that this work constitutes a desired new allegorical exposition of Genesis and that, in the first exegetical work that he wrote after the decisive vision in London, Sweden borg disclaimed any validity in the passages that were at variance with revealed Scripture. From this point of view, it is clear that, although it is written in prose, we are justified in considering The Worship and Love of God as belonging to the series of poems about creation that became fashion­ able toward the end of the Renaissance, and of which Haquin Spegel was, in Sweden, the most characteristic representative. It is unneces­ sary to dwell upon the work which served as model: this was cer­ tainly Milton's Paradise Lost. We have no material proof that Swedenborg knew Milton's work. The fact that in a letter to Benzelius dating from 1711, he mentions Milton among the most celebrated writers in England does not in itself prove much)77 It is hardly likely that he had read all these authors, Shakespeare among them. It is more probable that he 184"

But on the other hand, it is quite likely that he read Milton during his stay in England, or that he became acquainted with him in Sweden. The venerable Spegel had already quoted passages from Paradise Lost; and Dalin exhibits, in his poem \"Swedish Liberty,\" which is almost contemporary with Worship and Love of God, manifest Miltonic influences. A comparison between the two works, moreover, confirms that Sweden borg was ac­ quainted with Milton and was influenced by him. First of all, one is struck by a certain similarity between the structures of the two works. They both give the same importance to the struggle between Satan and God as they do to creation itself and to the destinies of the first human couple. For both, it is the human being who constitutes the final setting of the struggle between the two universal principles. They both have the purpose of expounding, within the framework of the biblical account, a doctrine that is at once philosophical and theological, and the means to which they have recourse are partly the same. In The Worship and Love of God, Adam's long conversations with the intelligences have their equivalent in Adam's long conversations with the archangel Raphael that occupy several books of Paradise Lost and by which we are instructed about the creation of the earth, of heaven and of its angels, and about the aims of God regarding the human creature. The descriptions of the creation of Eve are also similar. Genesis simply states that God sank Adam in deep sleep, during which he ex­ tracted a rib out of which he created Eve. In Paradise Lost, book 8, 11.478-480, Adam already sees in his dream the woman who will be­ come his consort. Her aspect, which exceeds in beauty everything he had seen up to that moment, awakens in him a new sentiment and, on awakening, he is disconsolate at the vanishing of his dream: Shee disappear'd, and left me dark, I wak'd To find her, or for ever to deplore Her loss, and other pleasures all abjure. The moment he lost hope of ever seeing her again, he sees her approaching in her living form, conducted by her invisible Creator. 185"

In the dream, during the course of which God takes his rib, Adam sees a nymph appear, so beautiful that he is immediately inspired by an ardent love for her and wishes to take her into his arms. She tries to escape his embrace; and at the very moment he succeeds in grasping her, he awakens and perceives, to his great chagrin, that it was only a dream. He is unable to console himself for her loss and unceasingly evokes the memory of the gracious appari­ tion. The day finally arrives when he finds her again, just as she ap­ peared to him in a dream, when the heavenly intelligences lead her to him. Even though this appearance of the first woman to her future husband might seem a natural invention, and the similarity of the two episodes might therefore be fortuitous, the same explication can­ not be applied to the scene I have related above, when Eve sees her­ self mirrored in the water for the first time and perceives her own visage with astonishment. The analogy with the famous narration of Milton (Paradise Lost, book 4, 11. 460-469) is truly striking, and one seeks in vain in Genesis the equivalent of this episode, which Milton is presumed to have borrowed from the myth of Narcissus in Ovid's Metamorphoses. This analogy is even found in details. With Milton, Eve perceives that the face which appears in the mirror of water alters and changes in expression just as she herself does: As I bent down to look, just opposite, A Shape within the watery gleam appear'd Bending to look on me. I started back, It started back, but pleas'd I soon return'd, Pleasd it returnd as soon with answering looks Of sympathy and love; there I had fixt Mine eyes till now, and pin'd with vain desire, Had not a voice thus warn'd me, What thou seest, What there thou seest fair Creature is thyself, With thee it came and goes ....

It is nonetheless obvi­ ous that the two descriptions can be precisely superimposed upon each other.

The book swarms with allusions to classical myths and fa­ bles-to the point that, in two modern translations, a mythological glossary has been annexedP8 Also as in Milton, the incidents are frequently illustrated by Homeric images, where names of classical localities predominate. Perhaps this Miltonic character is most ap­ parent in the description Swedenborg gives of the Prince of the World, clad in resplendent armor like an ~ncient commander at the head of his legions. This is exactly like the form in which Milton loves to portray Satan. In Worship and Love of God as in Paradise Lost, we find the story of a great battle of which Jesus Christ pro­ vokes the final decision between those loyal to God and those loyal to Satan.l 79 If the conception of God and his relation to the world that emerge from Paradise Lost is studied a little more closely, it seems there is some reason to suppose that the Miltonic influence has made itself perceptible not only on the literary style of Worship and Love of God but that it has also had an effect on Swedenborg's theological pe­ riod. The Puritanism of Milton is indeed strongly mixed with a Neo­ platonic doctrine of emanation, which we have already detected in Swedenborg, but which led up to conclusions that Swedenborg was to draw only during his theological period. It is not yet known ex­ actly, to my knowledge, where Milton got this concept. What is known, however, is that he was very familiar with Plato and most certainly also with Plotinus. The influence of Renaissance Platonism can also be acknowledged. This Miltonic doctrine is known to us today, not only from Par­ adise Lost, but also from De Doctrina Christiana, which was not pub­ lished until 1825. The view here is generally characterized by English scholars as a kind of modified pantheism.l 8o In reality, it constitutes a typical Neoplatonic system of emanation. God is an incomprehensi­ ble unity, the only real existence. It is from God that all creation em­ anates and which is one day to return to God.

Beneath these words of the archangel Raphael to Adam (Par­ adise Lost, book 5, II. 469-479) we also see, in its smallest details, the image of the universe that Swedenborg imagined. From this starting point, Milton fearlessly draws all the conse­ quences it implies without worrying about orthodox dogma. Above all he is a certified anti trinitarian. The Son is not coeternal with the Father; he is born by the will of God and lives from his substance. Milton rejects the thesis that the world was created from nothing and believes that it issues from the very substance of God. He denies the existence of any antinomy between the soul and matter. The soul is only of a more refined matter and cannot be separated from the body, with which it forms a whole. \"The whole man is soul, and the soul man.\"181 He also believes the unit is composed of soul and body-which, according to Genesis, was made of the dust of the earth-and that it is a mistake to believe that the soul was \"the spirit of life\" that was immediately breathed by God into the human creature. Like Swedenborg, Milton adheres to the traducian doctrine, ac­ cording to which the soul is transmitted to the son in the sperm of the father. It is not only the soul that survives after death but also the body, in a more refined and spiritualized form. Without doubt, human beings support the life of the body by means of material nourishment; but since matter is inferior to the soul only by degree, there is no contradiction in the sublimation of the body into spirit.

This is a point on which this disguised \"materialism\" of Milton may be especially presumed to have influenced Swedenborg; it is in the application of this materialism to angels and to the world of spir­ its. We have seen that Swedenborg's initial conception of the spiritual world was far from being as realistic as it became in his theosophy (cf. above, chapter 5). Even in Worship and Love of God, one of the heav­ enly intelligences tells Eve that she has the faculty of assuming and abandoning the human form at will (Worship and Love of God §95). The forms in which these celestial beings appear to us are merely rep­ resentations. In themselves, they are incorporeal and free from all human affection (Worship and Love of God §44). It is naturally in full agreement with his Neoplatonism that Swedenborg, during his theo­ logical period, comes to attribute to his angels not only bodies com­ posed of a kind of \"substantial\" refined matter, but all the physiological functions as well. And his visions have naturally con­ tributed to concretize his conception of the spiritual world. But one can hardly refrain from supposing that Milton's extremely audacious conjectures about the physical functions of the angels have exercised a certain influence on Swedenborg. It is perhaps in the often-quoted passage where the archangel Raphael visits the first couple and where Adam asks him, not without hesitation, if he wishes to share their frugal repast, that the Miltonic conception stands forth the most clearly. At Adam's invitation, the archangel responds that the nour­ ishment given man by God, nourishment in part spiritual, should equally suit the purest spirits (Paradise Lost, book 5, 11. 407-413): and food alike those pure Intelligential substances require As doth your Rational; and both contain Within them every lower faculty Of sense, whereby they hear, see, smell, touch, taste, Tasting concoct, digest, assimilate And corporeal to incorporeal turn. 190"

The most important role played by the author of Paradise Lost for Sweden borg is beyond any doubt that the Swedish mystic learned from Milton to transform and modernize the biblical text, making the most of its poetic content while giving entry to his own concep­ tions. Like Swedenborg, Milton had transformed the naive account of the creation according to the cosmological ideas of his day and ex­ pounded his own philosophical and theological views. This tendency had already given Milton's work something abstract, at least in com­ parison with that of Dante. Not for nothing was he called the last adept of the abstractly allegorical school of Spenser. In any case, the primary interest of his work lies in its poetic element; the didactic and religious aspect of his spirit are only secondary. To the contrary, Swedenborg undertakes to create a \"tiber divi­ nus,\" summarizing his philosophical and religious concepts as he has elaborated them in the course of his scientific studies and later devel­ oped during his religious crisis. At the moment he first sets his hand to his new work, he is convinced that he does not have to grope among the shopworn ideas of others, but that God will inspire him to write what he should. It was half against his will that the poetic ele­ ment had slipped into his work. When, toward the end of his life, he was asked whether The Worship and Love of God should be included among his canonical works, he was accustomed to reply that it was based on the truth, but a bit of his egoism had slipped in and he had made a somewhat playful use of Latin.l 82 It is most certainly through fear of allowing himself to be seduced by \"egoistic\" artistic interests that he was so cautious to give no place in his work to anything that could not be explained allegorically as part of his philosophical sys­ tem. Even what appears to us as the most palpable reality is to be in­ terpreted as an abstract truth. It follows that Swedenborg's work never achieves the concrete character of Paradise Lost. The figures of the Swedish mystic never cease to be symbols of the faculties of the human soul; their activity is always destined to be transposed from the material domain to the spiritual.

There no doubt exists in his later works many passages comparable, for their poetic grandeur and artistic style, to Worship and Love of God particularly the memorabilia found in Conjugial Love. But in the theological works, these poetic beauties are fre­ quently wrapped in dogmatic reasonings, whose sound and at times fastidious development dismay most readers. The Worship and Love of God escapes this rigid dogmatism. Here it is not with the revelator of a new religion that we have to deal, who has his dogmas crystallized at every point, but with the religious dreamer, the mystic who for the first time clothes in a poetic form the thoughts that have been the subject of his meditations for a long time. At the moment when, after his crisis, he rejects his books and his sci­ ence, never again to allow his thoughts to be guided but by the hand of God, he feels himself reborn; he returns to the state of innocence which was that of the first human couple before tasting the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge. He has just rediscovered the lost paradise. He nonetheless continues to envisage the problem of the origin of the universe and of humankind from a scientific angle, and it may be said that, to a certain extent, his work is a continuation of his re­ peated efforts since his youth to reconcile the biblical myth of cre­ ation with his own cosmological and psychological theories.

He has been allowed to see the light that emanates from the spiritual sun, he feels conjoined to the Divinity in his blissful ec­ stasies, and he has acquired, through his dreams and visions, the cer­ titude that supersensory beings exist beyond our universe. It is in this new essence of life that he wishes, in Worship and Love of God, to have the reader participate. But he does not do so by way of confession.

But it is precisely because, in The Worship and Love of God, Sweden borg doesn't yet believe himself constrained to reproduce his own experiences directly and because he does not yet appear con­ vinced of their verity that he gives his poetic imagination a freedom he will not venture to grant it in the future. Conceived in a spirit that is intermediate between the scientific commentary and biblical para­ phrase, his work comes strangely close to the symbolic tales of Ro­ manticism.

One of these asks him how it happened that, while approaching along the path leading toward them, at one moment he was visible and at another moment he dropped out of sight. \"Smiling at this I said, 'I am neither a stage player, nor a Vertumnus, but I am alternately in your light and in your shade; thus here I am both a foreigner and a native'\" (True Christian Religion §280). These words could serve as an epigraph for Swedenborg during his twenty-eight final years. He feels he belongs only half to the world he treads and appears to most people he meets as a strange and inexplicable being. Despite the curiosity of which he was the object among his contemporaries, the numerous and detailed descriptions of his life during the course of his last decades of existence hardly pro­ vide us with any real clue to his personality. \"In winter he wore a reindeerskin coat and in summer a like­ wise well-worn dressing gown recalling the wardrobe of a philoso­ pher,\" reports Robsahm in his memoir.183 Robsahm hastens to add that Swedenborg was simple but adequate in his grooming, except when he happened through distraction to overlook some detail of his dress or to wear shoe buckles that did not match. Less charitable ob­ servers declared that, at least in his declining years, his clothing was quite negligent.

In Stockholm, his meal was composed only of a piece of wheat bread dipped in warm milk;186 when he was abroad, he contented himself with a cup of chocolate and dry biscuit.187 He never had supper, but frequently during the day he would drink a cup of heavily sugared coffee that he prepared himself in the tiled stove. He had no real intimates. At his home at Hornsgatan, he was served by the elderly wife of the gardener, whose sole duty appears to have been to make his bed and bring to his chamber a large kettle of hot water every morning. It seems that, during his journeys, he saw very few people, and it is rather odd that, despite his long sojourns in London, he found it very difficult to express himself in English. This voluntary isolation, however, was in no way due to misan­ thropy. Swedenborg appeared to suffer from a certain timidity that was partly provoked by an acute stutter. Here it is perhaps also neces­ sary to consider the consequences of his labors as a writer and of his habit of going to bed every evening at seven o'clock. When, during his last years, he returned to Stockholm, an odd character whom everybody wanted to see, he seemed to take pleasure in these visits, which contributed a bit of the unexpected to the monotony of his daily life. It was to receive all these curious visitors, Robsahm relates, that Swedenborg had built, in 1767, two pavilions, whose agreeable decor contrasted with the severe simplicity of his apartment,l88 One of these pavilions sheltered his library; in his study, he placed only the Bible in its original languages as well as his own manuscripts. In one corner of the garden, he had constructed \"a maze exclusively for the entertainment of the good people who came to see his garden, and more particularly their children whom he received with gaiety, 196"

Behind this there was another door furnished with a mirror, in which a green hedge and a birdcage were reflected, \"a pleasant effect intended to surprise those who opened the door of the second garden, which he declared more beautiful than the old one. This surprise particularly amused Swedenborg whenever he received the visits of inquisitive young ladies.\"190 It is certainly before this mirror that one should visualize the delicious scene related by Fryxell, in which a young girl asked Swedenborg to show her a spirit. In front of the house, there was a group of Holland boxwood shaped \"to represent animals and many other things.\" According to Robsahm, Swedenborg must have spent considerable sums on the de­ velopment of this artistry, no doubt also intended to amuse visitors. It appears that, when visiting other people's homes, Swedenborg displayed that same naive and rather childish gaiety. For he willingly accepted invitations, provided they did not interfere with his early evening habits. Despite the spartan simplicity of his ordinary life, Robsahm tells us that he did not disdain \"spreading good cheer in so­ ciety and to shed a poculum hilaritatis [cup of good cheer] in modera­ tion.\"191 At such times, he would abandon his old chestnut doublet and, to the amazement of his hosts, appeared \"ganz propre und wohlanstiindig in schwarzem Sammt gekleidet\" (entirely proper and be­ comingly clothed in black velvet), as Cuno tells us.l92 An interesting and instructive conversationalist, very gallant with the ladies, he gave the impression of an old gentleman, friendly and worldly wise. After dinner, he would delay a short time to play l'hombre, which he greatly enjoyed, or preferably to listen to music. He had inherited a real passion for music from his father. \"Believe me,\" he said to Cuno at eighty-one years of age, \"if I knew that God would call me to him­ self tomorrow, today itself I would call musicians to rejoice me for the last time on this earth.\"193 197"

In his journal, Cuno strikingly de­ scribes the impression the great mystic left on his hearers, with his low and stammering voice and his dreamy light-blue eyes confidingly fixed upon the inquirer \"as if they radiated truth itself.\"194 In the nu­ merous assemblies of persons who came with the firm intention of ridiculing him as a visionary, it was not unusual to see the smiles fade from their lips as they listened open-mouthed to \"the marvels which Sweden borg related to them regarding the spiritual world with the frankness of a child ....

It would seem that Sweden borg was less fortunate when he tried to defend his theological doctrine. His stammer made him ill­ equipped for discussion, and he appears most often to have limited himself to referring his questioners to his books. He was absolutely averse to all proselytizing, and the rare disciples he made during his life appear to have come to him less from the effect of his personal in­ fluence than by the reading of his books. And undoubtedly very rare were those who sought him on ac­ count of an interest in his teaching. Most of his visitors came to see him because they were curious to meet a man who was known as a seer having the gift of prophecy. At that time, Swedenborg's celebrity both at home and abroad was due to his \"telepathic\" vision of the conflagration at Stockholm, the discovery of the lost receipt of Mme. de Marteville, and the interview with the late brother of Queen Louisa Ulrika. Swedenborg was personally quite upset by the popularity he de­ rived from these occurrences, feeling that it overshadowed his true mission. No doubt he did not contradict their authenticity, but he re­ garded them as of very small importance compared to his other vi­ sions.195 The result of this propagation of his \"miracles\" was that Swedenborg was overwhelmed by the requests \"of desolate widows wanting to learn the destiny of their late husbands, or of other per­ sons who, taking him for a medium, sought from Swedenborg the 198"

And it appears from Swedenborg's responses to these demands that he had no intention of competing with Arfvidsson, a famous fortune­ teller in contemporary Stockholm.l 97 I have summarized these episodes from the last decades of Swedenborg's life, most of them well-known, for the purpose of showing how peaceful and idyllic this life appeared to be. The great dreamer felt himself already to be halfway a participant in the life of the other world. \"Whoever has experienced conjunction with the Lord,\" he told Cuno, \"has already a foretaste of eternal life and who­ ever has this foretaste puts little value on this ephemerallife.\"198 All his contemporaries, even those openly hostile toward him, are in accord in proclaiming the rectitude of his judgment in respect to matters of this world. \"The old man talks most reasonably on all other subjects,\" say Liden in his notes on their meeting in London in 1769, \"but the moment one starts to talk about spirits, he becomes crazy; and my belief and my conviction are that the old man is not entirely same.\" And Tessin records his recollection of Swedenborg as follows: \"My faith and my reason being solid, thank God, it is easy to imagine the opinion I could have of this man. He is otherwise of agreeable conversation, without obstinacy, susceptibility or conceit, amiable, courteous, and frank; judging men and the times with dis­ tinction, interpreting everything with kindness and appearing as a philanthropist who passes his days agreeably and takes pleasure in his fantasies, for which there is probably no remedy.\" Tessin adds, \"I can't say whether I consider a weak character who enjoys his imagi­ nation as happy or unhappy.\"199 If I have recorded two of the most unfavorable opinions that have been adduced regarding Swedenborg, it is because some of the psychiatrists who have affirmed the madness of the great Swedish mystic have cited as proof the fact that all his contemporaries looked upon him as deranged. It appears quite clearly that these contempo­ raries of Swedenborg postulated from the start the principle­ elevated to a dogma-that whoever did not share their \"sound faith\" could only be a more or less unbalanced dreamer.

Indeed, quite to the con­ trary, his contemporaries agree in acknowledging, not without a cer­ tain surprise, the impression of calm and good sense arising from his conversations on any other topic. He undoubtedly appeared to be a most uncommon character exhibiting a somewhat youthful inno­ cence and naivete, above all during his latter years, but no abnormal­ ity was ever apparent as long as he did not talk about his religious ideas. Furthermore, his visitors had only highly confused ideas about Swedenborg's religion, having, for the most part, drawn their notions from his replies to their questions. I do not intend to deny that Swedenborg, during this period, may have been subject to some kind of mental illness. But the testi­ mony of his contemporaries cannot be accepted as proof. To them, all religious dreamers whose teachings were at variance with the estab­ lished church were as mentally deranged as Swedenborg was. At this time there were only two ways of explaining heterodox doctrines: conscious fraud or madness. Furthermore, the external circumstances accompanying Swedenborg's visions have been endowed with a supernatural aura they probably did not have in reality. An influential example is the anecdote related by Atterbom regarding Swedenborg's interview with VirgiL200 As was his custom, Atterbom, who cites Porthan as his informant, has not failed to embellish with his own imagination what has been reported to him. According to Atterbom, Porthan, when visiting Swedenborg, had to wait a moment in the salon and listen to his host converse flu­ ently in Latin \"on the antiquities of Rome\" with an imaginary indi­ vidual whom he escorted to the door with all gestures of the most exquisite courtesy, with a friendly nod to Porthan in passing. After taking leave of his visitor following further effusions, Sweden borg returns toward Porthan and tells him he has just had a visit from Vir­ gil, \"a very charming man.\" Swedenborg's disciples have vainly tried to demonstrate that the episode has no historical validity. Sweden­ borg never regarded spirits as moving in the earthly environment, and the idea certainly never entered his mind to offer them chairs 200"

As Tafel points out, it is still more im­ plausible that, while Swedenborg was having a visit with Virgil, he could have recognized and greeted his Finnish guest.201 Finally, the very topic of his alleged conversation with Virgil is hardly plausible. Thanks to its simplistic style, this legend has nevertheless acquired a popularity that has overshadowed the truly authentic accounts of the external circumstances surrounding Sweden borg's visions. These accounts are in accord with the evidence that, on the occa­ sion of these visions, Swedenborg found himself in a kind of trance and was entirely unconscious of the presence of others. The Danish General Tuxen relates that he surprised him one day in such a state, finding him with his elbows on a table and head in his hands. His eyes were open, looking upwards. When Tuxen spoke to him, he awoke, but it took him some time to recover his animation. 202 The same ac­ count was given to Robsahm by the wife of Swedenborg's gardener, who naively added \"that the pupils of his eyes shone with the clearest fine light and that this glow only faded after half an hour.\"203 It appears that at times in his states of trance Swedenborg spoke aloud, especially when he was being tempted by evil spirits. The old gardener couple confirms having heard him in crises of this nature weeping and invoking the help of God's mercy.204 A similar account is found in Ferelius. 205 These trances seem to have the same external form as Sweden­ borg's first visions. It is probable that they were, like these, released by a critical inhibition of respiration. Indeed, in his Spiritual Diary, Swedenborg declares that, thanks to \"internal breathing,\" he could establish communication with angels and spirits (cf. chapter one above). By having recourse to indications that Swedenborg himself gives, notably in his Spiritual Diary, it is possible to penetrate the di­ verse forms of his visionary states in detail. Sweden borg himself characterizes the onset of his communica­ tion with spirits as an awakening of his \"inner sight.\" This expression is worth dwelling upon for a moment. In Arcana Coelestia §994, he wrote the following: Except that there is interior sight, no eye can ever see. The sight of the eye exists from interior sight, and for this reason after the 201"

So too, when man sleeps, he sees in his dreams as clearly as when awake. It has been given me to see by internal sight the things in the other life more clearly than I see the things in the world. We will encounter this explanation again whenever it is a question of visions. It is thus that in another passage (Arcana Coelestia §1532), speaking of the heavenly splendors described by the prophets and through the Apocalypse, he writes: \"With the bodily eyes no man can possibly see [heavenly things], but the moment the interior sight or that of the spirit is opened by the Lord, such things become visible. The visions of the prophets were nothing else than openings of their interior sight.\" A retrospective glance at Swedenborg's psychological theories in Economy of the Animal Kingdom makes it possible to grasp his thought more precisely. In our ordinary perceptions, it is the anima that feels, sees, hears, etc., thanks to inner organs of perception that constitute the cerebral cortex; the external sensory organs are inter­ mediaries.z 06 That it is precisely this vision by the anima that Swedenborg calls \"inner sight\" is certain, since it is this vision we enjoy after physical death. It is in complete accord with this concept that, during his theological period, he speaks of it as of a \"vision of our spirit\" (visus spiritus) and clearly distinguishes it from the sight we enjoy through our corporal eyes. To possess this inner sight in the present life is thus to see without the help of the eyes or the cerebral optical centers (the \"internal organs of sight\")-to have, by the sole activity of the soul and in a waking state, visions as perfect as those we have in dreams. The fact that Sweden borg makes such a marked discrimination between \"inner sight\" and the perceptions of our \"corporeal eyes\" seems to me to prove that his visions, like those of most mystics, were of a pseudohallucinatory nature. In reality, it is precisely through mystics' revelations about their \"intellectual\" visions emanating from \"internal eyes\" that psychiatrists have acquired the notion of halluci­ natory phenomena that, unlike true psychosensory hallucinations, do 202"

While in visual hallucination, properly speaking, the vi­ sionary localizes his vision in space or, if his eyes are closed, upon an obscure field, pseudohallucinations have no spatial exteriorization. The subject is thus never tempted to confuse them with external real­ ity. They are distinguished from purely imaginative images by the feeling of psychic objectivity which they provide to the one experi­ encing them; moreover, they seem to be independent of the will. It is evident that Swedenborg himself distinguishes these visions from psychosensory hallucinations, which, as we have already seen (cf. chapter six above), he had also experienced. Among the strange forms of visions of which he has been the object, one consists in a kind of extraction of the man from his own body; he thus finds him­ self in an intermediate state between dreaming and waking. Person­ ally, he feels as if he is fully awake. All the senses are as fully awake as in the highest wakefulness of the body; the sight, the hearing, and wonderful to say, the touch, which is then more exquisite than it can e\\.'er be in the wakeful­ ness of the body. In this state also spirits and angels have been seen to the very life, and also heard, and, wonderful to say, have been touched, and almost nothing of the body intervened. (Ar­ cana Coelestia §1883) He compares this kind of vision with the one related by St. Paul in the 2 Corinthians 12:2-3, where he suggests that he was \"caught up to the third heaven-whether in the body or out of the body I do not know, God knows.\" Swedenborg reports having been in that state only three or four times, and then only to experience its nature and be convinced that angels enjoy all the senses as well as a tactile sensitiv­ ity more exquisite than ours (Arcana Coelestia §1883; Spiritual Diary §651; Heaven and Hell §440). It is difficult to establish whether Swedenborg is in a waking state at the moments when he had visions of this nature. It is possible that, although he may feel as ifhe is awake, he may not consider him­ self to be because his doctrine is opposed to the possibility that man, while awake, can see and touch the spirits physically.

It is further useful to recall that the great vision in London also be­ gins by the apparition before his eyes of a darkness that dissipates thereafter. What matters to us is, nevertheless, the marked difference be­ tween these rare forms of visions, with their clearly pronounced sen­ sory character, and the visions that Swedenborg qualifies as ordinary in this respect. In the Arcana Coelestia, he even refuses to give them the name of visions. Rather he is communicating and conversing with angels and spirits in a state of complete wakefulness as though he were one of them (Arcana Coelestia § 1884; Heaven and Hell §442). In the Spiritual Diary §651, he designates this category of visions with which he is the most familiar under the name of \"representative visions\" received with open eyes (in aperti oculi statu) and by which heavenly things are represented-spirits or other manifestations. This kind of vision is more confused than the \"living\" vision previ­ ously described, but is clearly distinguished from common human imagination (imaginatio). In the Arcana Coelestia (§§1966-1973), Swedenborg establishes a marked distinction between these visions and illusions. He gives a detailed description of the latter, which he ascribes to a state of weakness of the animus that renders the visionar­ ies credulous. He also seeks to separate out the visions that \"enthusi­ asts\" have in matters of faith, visions that emanate from evil spirits. By genuine visions are meant visions or sights of such things in the other life as have real existence, and are nothing but actual things that can be seen by the eyes of the spirit and not by the eyes of the body, and that appear to a man when his interior sight is opened by the Lord (that is, the sight which his spirit has), and into which he comes when, separated from the body, he passes into the other life; for a man is a spirit clothed with a body. Such were the visions of the prophets. When the sight is opened, then those things which have actual existence with spir­ its are seen in clearer day than that of noon in this world, not only the representatives, but also the spirits themselves, together with a perception of what they are, also of what essence they are, whence they come, whither they are going; also of what 204"

Thus, the visions Swedenborg had of the spiritual world shone with a clear light, while the appari­ tions emanating from the heavens were much more vague. In many cases, one can only discover what is talked about in heaven through the intermediation of spirits. Finally, he mentions two visions he considers particularly apt for illustrating the characteristics of these experiences. They seem to me worth referring to here, as Sweden borg most often explains the nature of his visions by way of analogous examples: After a troubled sleep, about the first watch, I had a pleasant vi­ sion. There were wreaths, as if of laurel, quite fresh, in most beautiful order, with motion as if alive; of such form and ele­ gance of arrangement that description fails to express their beauty and harmony, and the affection of bliss that flowed forth from them. They were in a double series, at a little distance from each other, and running on together to a considerable length, and constantly varying the state of their beauty. This was plainly seen by spirits, even by evil ones. This was afterwards followed by another sight still more beautiful, in which there was heav­ enly happiness, but it was only dimly visible; there were infants in their heavenly sports, that affected the mind in an inexpress­ ible manner. (Arcana Coelestia §1974) Swedenborg talked afterward with spirits of various categories. We recall the striking analogy between this vision and the description found of heavenly games in The Worship and Love of God. We have already seen that Swedenborg's association with spirits has been, in large part, by way of conversation. If we examine his ap­ paritions more closely, we find that the majority are of a verbal 205"

However, the Journal of Dreams does not provide us with a more detailed description of the nature of these visions. Nonetheless, one may suppose that here, ac­ cording to all appearances, it is not a matter of auditory hallucina­ tions, but of these \"inner words,\" of which mystics often speak and which constitute an equivalent of the \"view within,\" the topic of our preceding exploration. A little later, we find very precise descriptions of this phenomenon in his accounts regarding the language of spirits. The question has already been touched upon in The Worship and Love of God. There Sweden borg describes the conversation between Adam and his intelligences; and in §53, note p, he explains this phe­ nomenon: \"The fact that Adam discoursed with his intelligences is to be understood as follows: he discoursed with himself, or with his in­ tellect, that is, that he thought; for thought is a certain kind of dis­ course with oneself, the operations of our mind being veritable actions {reales activitates} or changes of state by variations of form. It follows that they also constitute a kind of interior speech.\" He then develops his old theory: thoughts are fluid undulations transformed by the organs of speech into atmospheric vibrations and thereby into sounds: If it were otherwise, and were it not the same with eyesight, it would be impossible to perceive what we think and even more so to talk to ourselves, to utter the same thoughts, to transform them into sounds or articulated words .... Thought, then, being a real speech, and more perfect than that of our larynx, at the same time including more simultaneous and successive elements, it follows that it is heard and understood by the celestial souls, called angels, entirely as well and even better than oral speech is understood by our companions and by our interlocutors. As we see, here Swedenborg conceives the language of angels as a pure transmission of thought. He is not yet speaking of inner voices. It is evident, however, that his conception of thought as an inner lan­ guage involves a certain predisposition towards this kind of verbal pseudohallucination. 206"

      "text": "THE SPIRIT SEER It is beyond doubt that it is a matter of hallucinations of this cat­ egory in Historia Creationis a Mose tradita, written in 1745. With re­ gard to the conversation between the serpent and Adam, Swedenborg, by invoking his own experience with the language of spirits, gives us several indications of high value, probably recalling above all the occurrences of the preceding years. He declares here that the language of celestial beings issues from marvelous circles of heavenly form and is so universal that it corresponds to any spoken language. This language enters first into the thought or the inner sight and there gives birth to barely conceivable elevated ideas, thereafter to evolve into the habitual tongue of the hearer .... There exists, therefore, a language common with spirits and men who live in the state of our first ancestors, just as among earthly interlocu­ tors: but this language is an internal one. Also, this language is even as sonorous as if it proceeded from the mouth and tongue, although it is not transformed into any sound. (Adversaria I, §§15-16) Swedenborg adds that no mortal can have knowledge of this lan­ guage if it has not been given to him or her, as a spiritual being, by the grace of God. It is this same language of the spirits that later, during the course of his theological phase, Swedenborg says he understands. In the de­ tailed descriptions that he gives in the Arcana Coelestia (§§1634-1650, §§1757-1764) and elsewhere, he makes it plain that this language is the mother tongue of the initiate and that it is as distinct and as clearly understood as the ordinary speech of human beings. It is not, however, transmitted by air or through the ear, but carried in an inner way to the very organs of the head and brain. This is why it is perceived in the same fashion. In reality, the language of spirits is composed not of words, but of thoughts. Spirits possess only internal memory and are consequently incapable of pronouncing a single word. But when they communicate with a person, their thoughts are transformed into words in the corporeal memory of the latter and are thereby translated into the very language of the listener (Arcana 207"

These words, pronounced by spirits or rather evoked by them in the memory of the listener, are distinguished by being particularly well-chosen, clear, and clearly articulated. They are particularly adapted to the thought they are to express, just as when a person, without thinking of the words, leaves them to be dic­ tated by the internal phrasing itself. Sweden borg says he has con­ versed with angels by means of his internal memory too, that is to say in their own language, the language of thought (Arcana Coelestia §§1638-1639). During Swedenborg's conversation with spirits, he has a sense of their spatial location. He perceives them in various parts of the body: in the head, in one of his ribs, one of his elbows, or within his organism, according to the seat of various spirits in the \"Grand Man.\" He thus comes to know their spiritual state and their nature. He even deduces their character from the tones of their voices (Arcana Coeles­ tia §1640). Swedenborg's minute descriptions allow us to link this percep­ tion of the language of spirits with the \"internal speech\" of which all mystics often speak and which modern psychiatry identifies with \"verbal pseudohallucinations.\" I believe it useful to analyze here in some detail the explanation Seglas gives of the origin and nature of these hallucinations. 207 It is, of course, impossible for me to judge the exactitude of his theory, but we shall see that it strangely accords with Swedenborg's attempts to explain the phenomenon. \"We think with the help of words,\" says Seglas. \"Each item of thought is translated in our mind into a verbal formula. This is what is called the inner language.\" As we see, we have there a point of de­ parture identical with that of Swedenborg in The Worship and Love of God. Our awareness of this internal language is in general rather un­ clear. However, there have been cases in which this language be­ comes, without effort on our part, spontaneously more alive in a way that the subject comes to hear in himself his own thoughts trans­ formed into verbal form. This phenomenon is at times so intense that not only the words become clearly perceptible, but they acquire a kind of tone, a true internal resonance that is clearly different from the external sound of a word as perceived in the ear. Psychiatrists note an analogous phenomenon in the fact that, in certain persons 208"

As Kandinsky remarks, this phenomenon already partially presents the compulsive quality of pathological hallucinations. 2os The musical motif \"rings\" in the ear, and the hearer cannot shut it out. Verbal pseudo hallucinations assume the form of monologues or dialogues. Most often the subject is immediately aware of hearing his or her own thoughts. There have been cases, nevertheless, when this is not at all so: the speech appears enigmatic, in contradiction with one's own will and one's own desires. They do not come from him, and he exercises no control over them. Here, a psychic automatism intervenes, accom­ panying objectivization. Seglas, whose explication I here follow point for point, maintains that the moment when the subject finds himself thus in conversation with his inner voices, he distinguishes them from his own mental responses by the fact that they are notably clearer than and completely independent of his own will. Like sev­ eral other researchers who have studied this phenomenon, Seglas notes that the subject usually localizes these voices, not in his auditory organs, but in other parts of his body. It is thus that they frequently seem to emanate from his chest, epigastrium, etc.209 It seems to me quite interesting that it is possible to establish that Swedenborg's visions and revelations-like those of most mys­ tics-are basically of a pseudo hallucinatory character. Of course, this does not explain their meaning or their significance to the evolution of Sweden borg's world view. As I have already pointed out, psychi­ atric diagnoses that pretend to explain historical phenomena from some pathological trait are inadequate and unscientific; in reality, nu­ merous other factors also have to be taken into account. This kind of approach appears exceptionally absurd in this case, when we are deal­ ing with such a uniquely intelligent mind as that of Swedenborg, who had intuited profound religious views from his far-reaching philosophical speculations long before he had experienced any hallu­ cinatory states. 209"

Swedenborg's doctrine, then, is not as it is portrayed by the psychiatrists who have studied him; it is not a sort of \"con­ glomerate\" of his hallucinations. It would be more accurate to say that, after the period of crisis revealed in the Journal of Dreams and up to his last years, Swedenborg's visions and appearances are no more than objectivized manifestations of his own world of thought, a continuation of his conscious speculations in the form of dreams and hallucinations. In a way, Swedenborg himself was convinced that this was so, and he repeatedly declares that the doctrines he proclaims have not come to him \"from any angel,\" that is to say, by a vision, but that he had them \"exclusively from God while reading the Bible\" (True Christian Religion §779). With this quite natural reservation, it appears to us that, in ac­ cepting the analogy between Swedenborg's visions and the pseudo­ hallucinations so well-known to modern psychiatry, we arrive at certain conclusions of the highest interest about the external forms of Swedenborg's \"relationship with spirits.\" First of all, the pseudohallucinatory character of Swedenborg's visions seems to a certain extent to answer the question posed by all commentators on his theosophical phase: how was it possible for him for years and years to be the daily object of visions-which were at times highly fantastic-without showing any observable sign of men­ tal imbalance and without causing his theological work to lose any­ thing of its penetrating character? It is easy to demonstrate that his theological doctrine, such as he expounds it at the age of eighty-two in True Christian Religion, notably surpasses in logic and clarity the scientific doctrines of his Economy of the Animal Kingdom and con­ temporary works. In effect, it appears to be well-established that pseudohallucina­ tions neither suppose nor involve mental disturbances that are as marked as true psychosensory hallucinations.

Many psy­ chiatrists even refuse to admit the hallucinatory character of these phenomena and believe that here it is a question of inner images that the subject interprets as apparitions. In Seglas's study, he avers that pseudohallucinations, particu­ larly verbal ones, frequently coincide with a belief in telepathy and spiritism or that they appear in individuals who believe they are the objects of magnetism or suggestion. \"The particular ideas of direct in­ fluence, that is to say, without sensory intermediaries, amounts to a march toward verbal pseudohallucination.\"210 Needless to say, this conception responds very well to the case of Swedenborg. It was pre­ cisely this belief in an influence independent of any sensory element that led him to mysticism. In reality, the majority of mystics give ex­ planations of their visions and their spiritual conversations that are very similar to those Sweden borg has given of his. I have even found, in a case referred to by modern psychiatrists, a representation of an interior memory similar to that related above: \"Mme. Kr. declared that she had two memories: one which enabled her, like anyone else, to remember everything at will, the other which recalled to her awareness voices and internal images without intermediary. She also distinguished between internal voices and external ones.\"211 I do not in any way wish to restrict the visions of Swedenborg to those apparitions and inner voices that rank in psychiatry as mental hallucinations. From his own declarations, it is evident that he had been the object of clearly characterized psychosensory hallucinations, visions during which he has seen spirits with his \"corporeal\" eyes and in which he has even touched them (Arcana Coelestia §1883). He has, furthermore, had auditory perceptions that he has localized in the acoustic organs, and he has even, without any doubt, been the object of complex hallucinations that Ballet qualifies as \"oneiric\" and which one might classify as a sort of waking dream, comprising coherent scenes in which all the senses of the subject appear to participate. Sweden borg's relations with the spiritual world are in no way limited to these various categories of hallucinations. He enters into contact with this world not only in dreams of various kinds (a description of which would take us too far afield), but also in a state of conscious­ ness that he describes as between sleep and wakefulness.

His minute descriptions of the spiritual world, its inhabitants, and their life, however particular in their details, do not bear the scrutiny of reason. We rarely find in Swedenborg these picturesque and colorful scenes so frequent in the accounts that popular visionar­ ies provide of their apparitions. Swedenborg's descriptions of the world of spirits, which are the most detailed and the most concrete, are often the most servile reproduction of terrestrial conditions. He rarely describes a landscape in a concrete fashion or points to such and such an individual character of a spirit, even though he furnishes the environments of these spirits with forests, groves and lakes, and causes the spirits to share in the material structure of man. Even in his abundant descriptions of the Last Judgment as it was given to him to witness in 1757 in the spiritual world, we find not the slightest pic­ turesque detail; these are indeed endowed with a certain living drama, but they give the impression of secondhand accounts. To a certain extent this remark also applies to the most fantastic of his works, Earths in the Universe in which he realized a dream that had haunted him since his scientific period. It is about a voyage across sundry planets with whose inhabitants and spirits he became ac­ quainted. The picturesque details there are at once very rare, and they present stereotypical characters. It is thus that Swedenborg re­ peatedly speaks of birds with golden wings which take flight across the azure sky. This lack of the picturesque is evidently explicable by the somewhat abstract nature of his imagination. It can also be ex­ plained by the theory of correspondences, which does not allow the author to mention any concrete detail that fails to respond to some­ thing spiritual. But the fundamental cause of this characteristic appears to be that most often these visions have not had for Swedenborg the char­ acter of entirely externalized hallucinations, but fall in the class of 212"

Since the subject does not lo­ calize these pseudohallucinations in external reality, they are fre­ quently distinguished from spatial conditions and from the proportions of this environment. From numerous statements in the Spiritual Diary, it is evident that he often had difficulties in describing them distinctly. Furthermore, a large portion of Swedenborg's knowledge of the spiritual world manifestly comes from his interviews with the spirits. And it is readily perceived, in a general way, that his contacts with angels and spirits are the object of a notably clearer description and are of a higher literary standard than his own eyewitness reports. Beyond a doubt, his most splendid descriptions of spirits are found in the memorabilia of his later works. They expound his philo­ sophical and theological discussions with the spirits, some of whom are specifically named, while others are anonymous. These brief scenes, which he frequently locates in an ancient setting, furnished with a few characteristic accessories, take place under the arcades of the Atheneum or in the octagonal palace built on Parnassus where the great philosophers of yore, wearing hyacinth-colored togas, are seated on stone benches, are crowned with laurel, and hold palm leaves in their hands. The conversations delivered in these schools of wisdom have a certain ancient style and recall the Dialogues of Plato, which were certainly present in Sweden borg's mind. In the closing chapter of True Christian Religion, he predicts that many readers will consider these reminiscences \"inventions of the imaginative faculties,\" but he assures us that he has reported only what he has seen and heard when completely awake. It does not seem to me that there could be cause to suspect the sincerity of that decla­ ration. For example, in one of his better-known reminiscences, he records that one day he had asked the Lord to grant him an interview with the disciples of Aristotle, Descartes, and Leibniz. Following this prayer, he had a vision in which he was visited by nine persons, three from each school, with whom he discusses the relation of the soul to the body.

It appears to be well established that an individual who is predisposed to pseudohallucinations can, in certain cases, con­ sciously assign a determined content to them.212 In any case, it is beyond doubt that Swedenborg has interpreted this vision-which only repeats his old theories on the interrelations between soul and body-not as a product of his own intellectual ac­ tivity, but as an emanation of inner voices independent of his will. The close kinship between a particularly vivid mental image and a verbal pseudohallucination suffices to explain the fact that these two phenomena can at times seem nearly identical in their exterior mani­ festations. In many cases, the psychiatrists themselves do not know whether they are dealing with a pseudohallucinatory phenomenon or a case of poetic inspiration. Finally, assuming that the greater number of Swedenborg's vi­ sions may have had a pseudohallucinatory character, it is possible to state that this spiritual world with which he believes himself to be in contact does not appear to him as an objective reality entirely exterior to his own being, but as partially an aspect of his own mind. As Se­ glas has pointed out, the psychosensory hallucination, with its illusory sense of an empirical reality, does not encourage the representation of spirits acting in the interior of the subject in the same way as does the pseudohallucination. To completely understand Swedenborg's views in this regard, it is first necessary to take into account his general the­ ory on the action exercised by spirits on man. This theory rests on the foundation of the psychological system with which we have become acquainted in Economy of the Animal Kingdom and in The Worship and Love of God. As in the latter, Swedenborg puts man into contact with heaven through the interme­ diary of the anima and with hell through the senses. But while he previously thought that the heavenly light was irradiated directly into the anima, just as the sensory desires came directly from hell through the animus, he has now become convinced that these influences man­ ifest themselves through the mediation of angels and of spirits, that is to say, through the souls of the dead. Animals alone are ruled by a general influence from the spiritual world, because they are born with instincts that are essential to them, and they have no need for 214"

Man, however, who has separated himself from heaven, no longer finds himself in the order of nature for which he has been created and must consequently be subject to the special guidance of God. If human beings did not receive influx from angels and spirits, they would throw themselves blindly into the deepest hell (Arcana Coelestia §5850; Heaven and Hell §247). This doctrine of spirits is found clearly characterized already in the first part of the Adversaria and in volume one of the Spiritual Diary. It can be traced back to 1745 or 1746. We find it in the Arcana Coelestia in a completely systematized form. \"Man cannot think or will anything by himself, but everything flows in; good and truth from the Lord through the heaven, thus through the angels who are with the man; evil and falsity from hell, thus through the evil spirits who are with the man\" (Arcana Coelestia §5846). Everyone is linked with two angels and two infernal spirits. If the human being did not find himself thus in contact with heaven and with hell, he could not survive for an instant (Arcana Coelestia §§5848-5849). The fact that people find themselves accompanied by two spirits of each category arises from the existence of two sorts of angels in heaven and two sorts of spirits in hell, to which the two fac­ ulties of the mind correspond: the will and the reason. A heavenly angel and an infernal genius contend for the will of the individual, while a spiritual angel and an infernal spirit act upon the person's in­ telligence (Arcana Coelestia §§5977-5978). The evil spirits and genii who are within the person indeed come from hell; but during their presence in the human creature, they are relocated into the world of spirits, intermediate between heaven and hell. They therefore suffer no infernal penalty, but expe­ rience the same love of self and of the world as the person to whom they have been sent. These spirits, who are associated with the human being who is their recipient, penetrate into his memory and into all his thoughts and feelings. They therefore share the same character as that person; they are miserly if the person is miserly, proud if he is proud, etc. And it is why, to the extent that his own in­ terior is modified, the person acquires new spirits, supplanting those that haunted him before (Arcana Coelestia §§5850-5852). 215"

Likewise, people are ignorant of their union with the spirits and with the an­ gels. Just as we imagine that we think and will of ourselves, so do the spirits associated with us consider as their own the thoughts and feel­ ings of the one they inhabit. Only the awakening of the \"inner sight\" of human beings allows them to become aware that they are led by angels and by spirits, and the latter then become aware of their conso­ ciation with humanity. This state implies great danger for hu­ mankind, for the spirits hold us in mortal hatred. Once they become conscious of their association with a man, they try by all means to de­ stroy him, body and soul. Such is the origin of the terrible tempta­ tions suffered by Swedenborg (Arcana Coelestia §§5862-5863). Through these tienstandar, \"spirit servants,\" a term used by Jes­ per Swedberg and at times by his son (Spiritual Diary §3985), a person finds himself, without his knowledge, in permanent association with the spiritual world. For in their turn, these spirits are influenced by other spirits. They in some way constitute ambassadors of the various societies in the spiritual world; indeed, there exist in this spiritual world societies concerning everything that can be the subject of human thought and desire (Spiritual Diary §4154). Thus, humankind becomes the focus of an infinity of spirits who influence our thoughts and sentiments. Since 1747, Swedenborg declares in his Spiritual Diary (§254), as myriads of muscles and fibers cooperate in an action, the elaboration of a thought demands the co­ operation of thousands of angels and spirits. He is very careful to be able to localize the seat of various spirits with reference to his anatomy. Their situation is determined by the place that they inhabit in heaven and in hell, both of which have the human form. The benevolent spirits appear to him to reside in large part around the head; spirits who provoke anxieties sit in the abdomen; the avari­ cious, a little higher, etc. Spirits act, not only on a human being's thoughts and feelings, but also upon his physical functions; for all natural phenomena is only the effect of spiritual action. There is, then, nothing surprising in Swedenborg's declaration, which appears already in his first exegetical works (Adversaria 1149ff.) 216"

In one chapter of the Arcana Coelestia (§§S711-S727), he even gives a detailed description of the fashion in which spirits cause mal­ adies. In effect, they have their origin in the desires and passions of the animus, which, in turn, emanates from infernal spirits. It is thus, as Swedenborg tells us, that a spirit who was an adulterer in the course of his life on earth appeared after his death under Sweden­ borg's feet and provoked a violent pain in his toe. Swedenborg goes as far as attributing to spirits the most trivial occurrences. He relates that having enjoyed an excellent butter one day in the presence of a celestial angel, he was then nauseated by it. It was then the spiritual angels who had caused a disagreeable odor of the butter to penetrate his nostrils. On the other hand, having one day tasted some milk in the presence of these same spirits, he experi­ enced indescribable pleasure. He concludes therefrom that butter re­ lates to the celestial angels and milk to spiritual angels, who detest butter. By this he understands not that angels consume these foods, but that the butter and the milk are representations of the angels (Spiritual Diary §§1161-1163). Evil spirits can play some very mali­ cious tricks in the course of a meal. They can give sugar the taste of salt (Spiritual Diary §64S). On the other hand, the good spirits watch him carefully so that there is no excess at the table. It was thus one evening when he had just finished his frugal repast of bread and milk the spirits found that he had eaten exaggeratedly and gave the food the odor of excrements and urine, from which he realized that he had committed the sin of gluttony (Spiritual Diary §618). He narrates else­ where, no doubt remembering an old popular Swedish prejudice, that the spirits did not allow him to think of pointed or sharp articles (Spiritual Diary §208). Like all people predisposed to obsession with demons, Sweden­ borg often finds himself painfully uncertain of the good or evil nature of spirits who influence him. He uses many means of distinguishing the infernal spirits from the celestial, but none of these appears to be infallible. He declares at times that he recognizes the infernal spirits by the chill he perceives at their approach (Spiritual Diary §406).

For the infernal horde is so cunning in its aptitude for impersonating angels and simulating objects of human imagination that a person would succumb to temptation at any mo­ ment if the Lord Jesus Christ did not himself restrain the demon (Spiritual Diary §617). As we see, the marvelous ecstasies dating from the crisis of the Journal of Dreams have already lost their divine char­ acter for Sweden borg. I have selected several examples from the Spiritual Diary at ran­ dom to provide the reader with some idea of the range of Sweden­ borg's intercourse with spirits. In every human thought, in each voluntary act, in every sensation, he sees the influence of good or evil spirits. They are even his mute collaborators in his descriptions of them. Thus he writes (Spiritual Diary §41S4) that, reflecting one day on the secrets hidden in the account of Noah's Ark in the Scripture, he became aware of the presence of certain spirits who were dis­ cussing these secrets. Some were talking about the opportunity for re­ vealing these secrets, others about the truth of the account, and still others about the possibility of disseminating them. And in a brief note on the origin of the Spiritual Diary (§2894), Swedenborg declares that all that he has written in this work derives from \"living experi­ ence,\" from conversations with angels and spirits, and that these in­ spire his thoughts and his words at the very moment he is writing; they have even guided his hand. In concluding, he says, \"Even this (which I am now writing) is directed by the spirits closest to my head, for I have often perceived their presence.\" It is not sufficient, however, to reach an understanding of the ties that link humanity with the spiritual world or for us to visualize ourselves as the center of an infinity of spirits who act upon the life of our souls. It is also necessary to understand that within, through his anima, each person is a spirit and belongs to the spiritual world. As Swedenborg states in Heaven and Hell §436, 218"

Thus did my interiors appear before them, for when talking with them as a spirit my material body was not seen. In comparing Swedenborg's visions with his theory of spirits, as I have tried to do above, one easily comes to understand that he came to consider all his psychic functions as being inspired by the angels and the spirits; at the same time, these spiritual influences became fa­ miliar phenomena for him. Like himself, all men are dependent on spirits and angels in their thoughts and in their feelings. What distin­ guishes Sweden borg from his fellow creatures is that he has received from God the gift of seeing the spirits. \"It has been given me to wit­ ness, by an experience so clear that it leaves no room for doubt,\" he states in a passage in Arcana Coelestia (§6191), \"that man is, by God's grace, directed by angels and spirits.\" He relates in this respect that it has been given him for several years to feel that all his thoughts and all his feelings enter into him through the intermediation of angels and spirits. He has received the gift of conversing with them, of iden­ tifying them, of recognizing to what \"society\" they belonged and even of engaging in conversation with their societies themselves. \"And though all the thoughts and all the feelings were emanations of angels and spirits, I thought and felt the same as previously, I spoke with men as in the past without anyone observing any difference be­ tween my current lifestyle and my preceding one, I expect that no­ body will believe me, nevertheless, what I am saying is the eternal truth.\" Swedenborg believes, then, that in spite of his constant intercom­ munication with spirits, he enjoys the same relative freedom in his thoughts and in his decisions as other people. When he finds himself in the street, in a crowd, and consequently he is no longer thinking of spirits, they are no longer aware of their presence within him. They 219"

The Swedenborgian doctrine of spirits is therefore not the prod­ uct of a disordered imagination that justifies his biographers in deal­ ing nonchalantly with his theology. It constitutes a systematic development of psychological theories that he expounds in Economy of the Animal Kingdom. Among the figures who appeared to him in sleep or in a state of wakefulness, he believes he recognizes dead friends and acquaintances. The inner voices he has heard have at times confirmed him in his belief and have at times tempted him to follow his earthly desires. Already during the period of his Journal of Dreams, these voices have been objectivized into good and evil spirits and have been made into intermediaries of two powers who dispute the domination of his soul: the sun of the divinity with its light and heat, and, on the other side, the world with its desires and tempta­ tions. In The Worship and Love of God, this conflict between the inner and outer man finds a universal correspondence in the struggle be­ tween God and the Devil. During his theological period, Sweden borg feels that the same combat is taking place within him, even though hell and the infernal spirits no longer have their origin in the revolt of the devil against God, but in the Fall of humanity itself. Created to live in the divine light and warmth, we have allowed ourselves to be seduced by the world and by the desire to be our own master. We tasted the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge; that is, we opened our inner being to the se­ duction of the senses. From that moment, we lost all direct contact with the Divinity.

I shall return to this reasoning in a more detailed fashion in re­ gard to Swedenborg's theology. I have discussed it here to show that, although it is built on visions and even on manifest reminiscences of the popular faith, the traditions of which reached him over so many routes, notably through his father, Swedenborg's doctrine of the spir­ itual world did not in any way constitute a loose appendage to his sys­ tem or a derogation of the structural principles of this system. The goal of this doctrine is to emphasize the fundamental notion that we have been able to follow from his first philosophical works, according to which God is the one and only life and the sole activity of the uni­ verse, and that all beings, whether of the spiritual or natural world, are only an emanation of his divine goodness and wisdom. The entire theological system of Swedenborg, as well as all of his visions, in real­ ity goes back to the day when, for the first time, he felt his interior penetrated by the divine light. If one wishes to see similarity between the experiences of his theological period and his first contacts with a higher world, it is use­ ful to read the description in Arcana Coelestia (§§168-186), where he relates that he learned \"by a living experience\" how a person passes from corporal to eternal life: \"I found myself in a state of physical in­ sensibility, in a state analogous to that of a dying man, while keeping intact my inner life and faculty of thought, so that I could observe and recall what happens to those who are dead and who have been resuscitated. I kept breathing to the extent necessary to maintain life and then breathed in silent respiration.\" As we see, this is precisely the state in which Swedenborg had already found himself in the fainting deliquia he had experienced while writing the preface of the Economy of the Animal Kingdom, and which he later suffered and described at the close of the Journal of Dreams. We recall that he had then been seized by one of his respira­ tory suspensions during a fainting spell when he \"had appeared to be close to death\" (cf. chapters three and six above). Later, in the Arcana Coelestia, he recounts that he found himself, in that state, completely isolated from the spirits of the world of spirits and entirely aban­ doned to the influence of celestial angels, two of whom take up place 221"

Thanks to the sensation of a kind of bal­ samic perfume, the presence of the angels gave an aromatic character to what had been a cadaverous odor. Then the angels proceed with a rite that consists of peeling a membrane from his eyes. The first effect of this operation is a vague luminous sensation like that one senses through the eyelids when awakening. When he is resuscitated and later enters into eternal life, the passage is represented in the form of a white light, embellished by yellowish reflections. We note that this apparent state of death, here, as with Swedenborg previously, engen­ ders the vision of a supernatural light. We therefore find again the same basic elements of the phenom­ ena Swedenborg sees as the definitive confirmation of the resurrec­ tion of the human being in the form of an angel and of his first vision that apprized him of the trans rational existence of a faculty of the soul-of a glass into which the divine light could penetrate directly from its original source. Since that time, we may well ask ourselves if Sweden borg him­ self has not observed this analogy, and if, during his theological pe­ riod, he has not accorded greater importance to these luminous visions that are accompanied by respiratory suspension than at the very moment when he experienced them. It is easy to prove that this is the case. In Heaven and Hell (§438) he declares that, in the course of corporeal life, a person becomes a member of a community by his soul. His anima becomes part of a heavenly community if he is good, and of an infernal community if he is evil. Swedenborg affirms with­ out any doubt that the human being is not visible in this \"society\" during his terrestrial life, from the fact that he thinks naturally. \"But,\" he adds, \"those who free their thoughts from their body (qui autem abstracte a corpore cogitant) show themselves on occasion in this society, for they are then in spirit; and when they are visible they are clearly perceived by the spirits there, for they are absorbed in their re­ flections, keeping silent without regard to those around them. Every­ thing occurs as though they did not see them and, once a spirit speaks to them, they disappear.\" Thinking abstracte a corpore is, for Sweden­ borg, to eliminate all impressions arising from the senses and to allow 222"

When he receives from God the order to abandon his scientific writing and to devote himself instead to religious studies, it is also by a kind of alle­ gorical exposition of the Creation that he inaugurates his new activ­ ity. The Worship and Love of God corresponds in a certain measure to the Kabbalistic and natural-philosophic paraphrases of the early chapters of Genesis, similar to those that were so numerous during the Renaissance and following centuries, beginning with the Hepta­ plus of Pico della Mirandola. Through the vision I have analyzed in previous chapters, however, Swedenborg received a further divine in­ junction to limit himself to comment on the inner sense of Scripture and write under the guidance of God. And it is to this exegesis that he dedicated the rest of his life. It would be an alluring task to relate in detail the evolution of Swedenborg's exegetic method up to its full development in Arcana Coelestia. A study of this nature would certainly be realizable, since Tafel published the largest part of the material under the title of Ad­ versa ria, while the rest exists in manuscript and in photolithographic reproductions. Nevertheless, this subject is beyond what I have pro­ posed to undertake, so I shall limit myself to relating briefly Sweden­ borg's conception of Scripture and its inner meaning. 224"

      "text": "THE EXEGETE When Swedenborg seeks, in his Historia Creationis a Mose tra­ dita of 1745, to explain the story of the Creation for the first time, he proceeds with the greatest circumspection. On the basis of two Latin versions, he only gives allegorical explications of the passages in which the biblical text seems obscure to him or which appear to con­ tradict his own cosmological principles. However, he often appeals to his visions and leaves it to be understood, at the end of the work, that the Bible text has a deeper meaning and that it shows that God has created the world to advance the kingdom of heaven, the heavenly Jerusalem. This thought is found consistently developed in his second commentary on Genesis, Explicatio in Verbum Historicum Veteris Tes­ tamenti. Here he considers the first chapter of Genesis throughout, not only as a description of the creation of the natural world, but also of the establishment of the kingdom of God. Paradise represents heaven; and the union of Adam and Eve, the union of the Messiah and the kingdom of God.213 In the course of this work, Sweden borg observes no fewer than three hidden senses behind the historical letter of Scripture. The nearest to the letter of Scripture is a universal one, generalizing what the Bible describes and applying it to the future. It is thus that the his­ tory of Jacob encloses that of the Jewish people as a whole. Beneath this universal level of meaning is found a second, of an even more ex­ tensive universality, by which the biblical text allegorizes the destinies of the entire human race. According to this sense, Jacob and Israel symbolize not only the Jewish people but the whole human species. Finally, the third, the most profound and the all-embracing of these deeper senses, applies exclusively to the Messiah and his future king­ dom. The Bible thus comes to present a certain analogy with hu­ mankind, its letter corresponding to the human body and the three hidden senses to the three degrees of the human soul (Adversaria 1,505). This latter line of thought is quite frequent in the history of bib­ lical allegoric exegesis. Earlier, Philo of Alexandria considered the lit­ eral sense as the body, enveloping the allegoric inner sense as its souL214 We find also an analogous interpretation in the Kabbalah, in which the literal sense becomes the apparel that covers the body.

This classification is simplified during the theological period, in the course of which Swedenborg generally reverts to the biblical trin­ ity of body, soul, and mind in humans. In his New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine §80, he declares that two other deeper senses exist behind the literal sense of Holy Scripture: one spiritual sense applies more particularly to the Church, and a still higher sense, the celestial, applies to God. These two layers of meaning in particular provide the object of his studies. Behind the historic narration in the Mosaic books, he traces a kind of spiritualized biblical history that relates how humanity has withdrawn itself more and more from the Divin­ ity and thereby has also departed more and more from that state of integrity in which Adam found himself created in the image of God. Accordingly, new revelations of the Divinity and of new churches are needed. We shall return later to this strange allegorical transformation of biblical history, to which Swedenborg has newly arrived through a combination of the biblical account with the ancient myths of the four ages of the earth. But he also discovers one inmost heavenly sense. Although it takes the form of historical accounts, it reveals to us a truth that is independent of all time and absolutely universal, where it is a question of God in his differing appearances and the re­ lations of man with the Divinity. To make this a little more intelligi­ ble to the reader, it is necessary to examine Swedenborg's method of interpretation more closely. It rests directly on the doctrine of corre­ spondences, in a form almost identical to the one described previ­ ously. Each word of the Bible being sacred and inspired, one should be able to substitute all the words representing natural things by spir­ itual concepts that correspond to them and that thus reveal an en­ tirely new hidden sense. Anyone who is ignorant of the doctrine of correspondences, said Swedenborg (Doctrine of Sacred Scripture §18), gets the impression that the Bible speaks much of terrestrial matters and very little of celestial things. But when it speaks about Egypt, As­ syria, and Edom, it must be understood thereby to refer to science, 226"

The lamb, goat, and cow signify innocence, love, and natural bents; mountains, hills, and valleys signify elevated matters, less elevated things, and the lower things of the Church. The method here applied is exactly the one Philo of Alexandria and Origen followed in their allegorical exegeses. I cannot here enter into the detail of comparative examples, which would lead us afar. Readers interested in the matter will find it dealt with in Siegfried's study of the commentaries on the Old Testament by Philo. From the summaries presented in this work in the form of tables of the allegor­ ical equivalents established by Philo and by Origen of the names of peoples, animals, trees, etc., it is evident that each author, despite in­ dividual differences in the results of their interpretation, operates on the same basis as Sweden borg. Both admit a priori \"that God ex­ presses himself like a man, without, however, speaking as a man.\"216 This starting point is identical to that of Swedenborg in the Clams, where he affirms that, in the Bible, the spirit speaks both nat­ urally and spiritually at the same time. In his later works, he ex­ pounds in more detail how everything in Scripture is expressed by correspondences. In the Bible, God speaks of his divine Being and of all that has a divine character, which is manifested in nature in the form of correspondences (True Christian Religion §201). It is evident that, with Swedenborg as with his predecessors, this concept is based upon the belief that the authors of the Bible were verbally inspired. Philo is of the opinion that it is God himself who speaks through the Bible, whether in a direct manner or in making his spirit speak through the mouth of the prophets, who thereby are not expressing their own thoughts but are merely instruments of revelation of eter­ nal verities. Philo does not recognize any differences between the various biblical scribes in this respect; they are conceived of as prophets, disciples of Moses. This concept, which is common in late Judaism and which one finds in the Epistle to the Hebrews, makes him consider the Bible as the source of the rule, not only of religious truth, but also of all truth.217 227"

For him, it is Jeho­ vah himself, the God of heaven and earth, who speaks in the Bible through the mouth of Moses and of the prophets. The Bible, then, is the divine truth, for the words of Jehovah cannot be but the truth (Doctrine of Sacred Scripture §2). In various passages, Sweden borg de­ scribes how the inspiration of the prophets comes about. Thus, inspi­ ration consists of an influx emanating from the world of spirits and from heaven in the form of dreams, visions, or spiritual speech, so that in moments of inspiration, they did not write their own words but the thoughts breathed into them by the spirits who possessed them (Arcana Coelestia §6212). The words they took down were di­ rectly dictated to them by the spirits (Heaven and Hell §254). And this is why the Scripture is the very life of God, the light of God that en­ lightens the world. It is in this sense that we must understand the words of the Gospel of St. John: \"What I say to you is spirit and life\" (Doctrine of Sacred Scripture §2). The style of Scripture is, conse­ quently, the style appropriate to Divinity; each sentence and at times each word enclose a sanctuary. The Word conjoins humankind with God and opens heaven to us (Doctrine of Sacred Scripture §3). One can then ask why this source of truth is not equally accessi­ ble to all people and why the inner meaning of the Scriptures consti­ tutes an arcanum. Echoing the explanation of mythology pronounced by Plato, Philo proclaimed that it was because the Divinity had to place it within reach of the weak intelligence of humanity. Since most of humanity is incapable of understanding the Divinity in all its pu­ rity, God must have recourse to anthropomorphism. 2IB In substance, Swedenborg's view is the same. He even maintains that, when the Word was given by God to the people of Israel through the mediation of Moses and the prophets, there existed a more ancient Word, written in correspondences that were extremely difficult to interpret. This Word, to which allusion is made in the books of Moses, was disseminated throughout Asia and, according to the revelations Swedenborg received from spirits, still existed in \"Great Tartary\" (True Christian Religion §279). It is in this Bible, the most ancient of humanity, that the ancients found their religious no­ tions. When the sages of antiquity, such as Aristotle, Cicero, Seneca, and others, wrote of God and the immortality of the soul, they drew 228"

Those who had an intimate knowledge of the correspondences of this Word were later to be called divines and magi. To the degree that anyone separated him-or herself from God, however, these correspondences became more obscure for that indi­ vidual. The Word began to be falsified; and from these correspon­ dences, falsely interpreted, various forms of idolatry arose among different nations. 219 This initial Word according to the will of God was therefore lost and was replaced through the mediation of the prophets of Israel with a Word composed of more intelligible corre­ spondences (Doctrine of Sacred Scripture §l02). As we recall, however, the doctrine of correspondences fell little by little into complete obliv­ ion and could not even be revealed to the early Christians because of the weakness of their spirit. Thus, the spiritual sense of the Bible re­ mained unknown. For this reason, only in a few cases the inner meaning of Scripture is known, namely what God himself revealed to the prophets. To succeed in discovering this internal sense anew, even in order to be conscious of its existence, it is necessary for the Divinity to in­ tervene. By the grace granted to Swedenborg to maintain an associa­ tion with angels over a period of several years, God has desired to reveal it to humanity through him (Arcana Coelestia §5 passim). The mission of the exegete is, consequently, for Swedenborg, entirely as dependent on divine inspiration as is that of the sacred scribes-a matter about which he is equally in accord with Philo. For the latter believes that his own interpretation of the Bible has only been possi­ ble through a direct collaboration of the Divinity and he relates that, finding himself in a state of \"enthusiasm,\" he has had divine visions about the hidden sense of the Scriptures.22 0 The marked concordance we have observed between Sweden­ borg and preceding allegorists, both in their assumptions about their rationale and in their methods, facilitates an explanation of the analo­ gies one notes in their conclusions, although there is no reason to sup­ pose that Swedenborg has borrowed directly from his predecessors.

A few examples will suffice to illustrate these analogies and at the same time to give an idea of Swedenborg's exegesiS. When God says to Abraham, \"Go from your country and your kindred and your father's house\" (Gen. 12:1), Philo interprets these words as a command given to humankind to break away from our body, senses, and language; for the body is only a parcel of the earth we are condemned to inhabit, the senses are the servants and brothers of thought, and language is no more than the envelope and dwelling of the intelligence that is our true father.221 In his eyes, Abraham rep­ resents the initial type of virtue acquired from teaching, just as Isaac represents the innate virtue and Jacob the virtue acquired by the practices of asceticism. 222 For Swedenborg (Arcana Coelestia §1404), Abraham represents the celestial man, Isaac the spiritual man, and Jacob the natural man. God's command to Abraham signifies that he must renounce corporeal things and the things of the world; the com­ mand to leave his family implies a renunciation of external things, while the command to abandon \"the house of his father\" means to re­ nounce interior things (Arcana Coelestia §§1411-1412). Ifwe proceed to the story of Hagar, we observe that, with Philo, the Egyptian ser­ vant girl represents encyclical knowledge, while Sarah represents in­ tegral virtue. Before being able to fertilize Sarah, Abraham will have to \"know\" Hagar. That is to say, before addressing theology, he must practice Chaldean meteorology.223 When he exiles Hagar, it is then human science, which claims preeminence, that he discards to dedi­ cate himself to higher science. In Swedenborg, we find an identical commentary. Sarah is intel­ lectual verity; the Egyptian servant represents the love of knowledge. In effect, Egypt means the sciences. The purpose of Abraham's liai­ son with Hagar is to permit the patriarch to attain to intellectual truth in cultivating his reason (ratio). \"Intellectual truth, which ap­ pertains to the inmost is altogether barren, or like a childless mother, when as yet there is not any rational into which and through which it may inflow\" (Arcana Coelestia §1901).

Moreover, he pursues his reasoning as Philo does. The newborn becomes presumptuous and finds him-or herself exiled by intellectual truth. I repeat that it is not at all my intention to establish, by this com­ parison, that Sweden borg would have borrowed the preceding com­ mentaries on the biblical accounts directly from Philo. To judge from the exposition by Siegfried, it appears that this transposition of the story of Abraham and of his liaison with Hagar had been taken, under a more or less identical form, from later commentaries such as those of Origen and Ambrose. 224 I believe that I have found these same analogies among other authors of whom I have made compara­ tive studies. Clearly, here we are dealing with an uninterrupted tradi­ tion of which Sweden borg is the late inheritor. A more profound study would undoubtedly reveal to us the works that have put him into contact with this tradition and which of the former allegorical exegetes to whom he was closest. For my purposes, it suffices to es­ tablish that he relies on this tradition not only in the method but also in its application. This fact explains in a certain measure the infallible certainty with which Swedenborg proceeds; it also helps explain the ease with which he succeeds in formulating a logical assessment of the biblical account without being forced to have recourse to extended modifica­ tions of the text or to revise previous explications of the correspon­ dences applicable in the context. On the other hand, the narrow dependence on the prior tradition would appear to me to deprive Swedenborg's biblical exegesis of its principal interest. Although he constantly assures us of the contrary, he has not discovered a new way of interpreting the Bible. The only difference between his results and those of his predecessors is, all in all, that his results have been adapted to his philosophical system, whereas the latter have allowed their explications to illustrate their respective sys­ tems. Like his forerunners, Swedenborg so freely used allegorical in­ terpretation to reshape the meaning of Scripture that it became possible for him to incorporate his whole philosophical system in his exegesis and to form a logically consistent theological doctrine out of 231"

When he repeatedly stresses in his theo­ logical works that he has learned all the teachings of his church from reading the Word (see for instance True Christian Religion §779), he is certainly sincere. All the same, it is quite the opposite. He has inde­ pendently formed a philosophical-theological view that he then point for point finds corroborated in his biblical studies. To show how this was possible, and at the same time to give the reader an idea of how much more radical his reinterpretation of the Bible was in the Arcana Coelestia than in his previous attempts in The Worship and Love of God and the Historia Creationis a Mose tradita, I will in the following give an account of the inner meaning of the Mo­ saic creation narrative (explicated by Swedenborg in Arcana Coelestia §§6-313). The first three chapters of Genesis relate to the most ancient Church, whose descendants perished in the flood. This Church had received in the Bible the name of Homo or \"Adam,\" which informs us that the latter was drawn from the dust (humus) and was made by God and born to the quality of a human being. It is this creation of humankind to which the first chapter of Genesis refers. More partic­ ularly, it applies to the birth of the original Church, but the six days of creation likewise symbolize the six stages in the regeneration of humanity. The work of regeneration was perfected on the seventh day, and the human, who was born from dead matter, has become spiritual and finally celestial. The Sabbath consequently refers to ce­ lestial man. When it is said that God created man out of the dust of the earth, it is to be understood thereby that the external man who formerly found himself in a struggle with the internal man, and who thereby was not a man in the proper sense of the word, acquired human stature and is placed at the service of the internal man. The following description of the earthly paradise also has an en­ tirely symbolic significance. \"Garden\" means intelligence, \"Eden\" love, and so forth. Up to that time, the biblical story described the most ancient Church in the age of its splendor. With the verses concerning the creation of woman (Gen. 2:18), we enter into an account of the apostasy of the descendants of the original Church.

The serpent, that is, the sensuality of humans, persuades the woman, that is to say, the proprium of the humans, to taste the forbidden fruit-in other words, to seek to elu­ cidate the articles of faith through the senses. Led astray by love of self, humans henceforth refuse to believe what is revealed to them unless this revelation is confirmed by their senses and empirical science. And humankind, properly speaking, the human reason, also allows itself to be persuaded to taste the for­ bidden fruit. Before this rupture of relations between God and hu­ manity, the latter possessed the faculty of seeing sensory things through heavenly things. Every object, at the moment of assuming a visible form, had evoked the perception of the heavenly and divine realities that it represents; human external sight was only the instru­ ment of inner life. After the Fall, sense perceptions became the essen­ tial phenomena. Judging heavenly things from earthly matters, humanity found itself struck by spiritual blindness. The following chapters of Genesis apprise us of the fate of the oldest Church up to the epoch of the Flood, when it was annihilated. The curse God laid on the serpent signifies that the sensory part of humanity, by its refusal to believe what the senses cannot confirm, condemned itself and became infernal. To avoid leading the whole of humankind into hell, God promised to come to earth himself. This promise is expressed by the passage that says the posterity of the woman will crush the head of the serpent. Finally, the exclusion from the earthly paradise symbolically shows how the later generations of the primordial Church saw themselves deprived of all inclination to­ ward the good and the true and were abandoned to their abject thoughts and gross desires so that they would no longer be capable of profaning the holy matters of faith. As we see, Swedenborg's symbolic representation of the story of creation is, in its broad lines, that which we find in The Worship and Love of God. But although he comments here on Genesis point by point, Swedenborg has managed to free himself from the biblical myth in a noticeably wider measure than previously. The story of 233"

Moreover, the historic element plays only a very attenu­ ated role here. Swedenborg himself declares {Arcana Coelestia §66} that the original Church, from among whose descendants Moses took all that he had written in Genesis up to the time of Abraham, did not limit itself to expressing these thoughts by representations, but also arranged them in a quasi-historic series, all to give more life to them. The naive story of the Bible, then, has given place to an abstract account of the essential problem that has not ceased to preoccupy Swedenborg since the Principia; that of knowing how humankind has been reduced to the uncertain road of empiricism while it pos­ sesses, in the inner core of its being, an organ created to receive the divine light directly. We shall see later how Swedenborg envisaged the solution of this problem. I have sought here only to establish, by a concrete ex­ ample, that this solution is the fruit of Swedenborg's own thought and not the result of his biblical studies. It is obvious to any reader that the factors Swedenborg tries to eliminate-the momentary Fall of Adam, the factual existence of evil, etc.-are clearly found in the biblical text. Only the implacable method that governs this transcrip­ tion permits Swedenborg to discover in the Scripture a hidden sense that is in part entirely contradictory to the text itself. It is beyond doubt that he himself was firmly convinced that each point in the Bible confirmed his own conceptions; and if one studies more closely the evolution of his speculations on the state of integrity in humanity, beginning from the Principia to the psychological explications of Economy of the Animal Kingdom and up to the notably more circum­ spect Worship and Love of God, one has no difficulty understanding how he has been led to introduce his own views into the history of creation. From the passage referred to above, it is plain that Swedenborg denies the historical character of the narration in Genesis for the whole period preceding the Fall.

In short, it is his own doctrine dressed in allegorical form and in the form of historical narrative. The parts of Scripture in which he does not succeed in finding this doctrine, such as Chronicles, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, the book of Job, and the Epistles, are declared to be barren of inner significance and to form no part whatsoever of the Word of God, properly speaking. It is this point that has led Sun­ delin to conclude \"that the real charter of religion must be found in the works of Swedenborg, and not in Holy Scripture.\"225 He justifies this conclusion by pointing to the doctrine of Swedenborg according to which \"the prophets and the apostles wrote without knowing themselves what they wrote.\" This same conclusion, Sundelin adds, \"is in no way weakened by the declaration of Swedenborg himself that his biblical exegesis is based upon or emanates directly from the letter of the Word.\" This way of thinking, which we find echoed in a number of variants among several theological authors in their studies of Swedenborg, is fallacious in the sense that they risk suggesting that, by a kind of rationalistic biblical critique, Swedenborg sought to un­ dermine the authority of the Scripture to the advantage of his own doctrines. On the contrary, for Swedenborg the Bible is not only \"the true charter of religion,\" but even the only \"authorized charter\" of this religion. The essential critique he levels against the existing Christian churches is that they have assimilated their own professions of faith into the Bible and insinuated their own accepted dogmas, such as that of the Trinity, which are not found in the Scriptures. Swedenborg is not an adherent of the doctrine of inspiration in its most verbally servile form, and he must therefore admit that, behind the written words as dictated by God through the prophets and the apostles, more profound verities lie concealed than they themselves suspected. 235"

The celestial word, which corresponds to our word, is written in characters everyone of which encapsulates a particular meaning. In the realm of the spiritual angels, these characters resemble our printed ones, while in that of celestial angels, they resemble the an­ cient Hebrew alphabet with characters crowned by figures oddly curved and surmounted or accented by signs. One does not find in these words either names of persons or names of places as in our own language; nor do numerals exist. These are both replaced by the things that correspond with the words. All angelic communities pos­ sess an example of this Word written by the angels, inspired by God in their turn, and it is in this Word that the angels find their wisdom. In the sanctuary that shelters this Word, there is a white and flaming light surpassing in brilliance every other celestial light. For God him­ self resides in the Word (Doctrine of Sacred Scripture §§72-74). The inconsistencies Sundelin tries to find in the Swedenborg's position on the literal sense of the Word disappear if one bears in mind this doctrine of its celestial correspondence. Even in its literal meaning, the Word is the divine truth. It possesses its holiness and power in fullness because at the same time it embraces a hidden ce­ lestial sense. The verities of the literal sense are not all naked truths, but only appearances of truths, images, and comparisons borrowed from natural things, and consequently adapted to the understanding of the simple and of children. But when they become correspon­ dences, they embrace primary verities, just as a crystal bowl holds wine (Doctrine of Sacred Scripture §§36-40). The truths that are more important to our faith are clearly enunciated in Scripture itself. The 236"

Therefore, a person is capable, without knowing anything about the doctrine of correspondences, of establishing contact with God and with angels through reading the Word of God. Every time the Scrip­ tures are read by a lover of God and that person is living a life oflove, God and the angels perceive the Word as alive, even if the reader, in his or her simplicity, merely believes in what is written. In a passage of great beauty, Sweden borg informs us that the angels understand the hidden sense of the Word when it is read by children who find themselves in a state of innocence and love and who consequently are more receptive to the inner light. These humble readers are them­ selves incapable of discovering the hidden sense of the Word and do not know that the angels reveal it through their mediation; but they feel a kind of inner joy in their spiritual state. That is why the angels affirm that the Word of God is in itself a dead letter, but that it comes alive, by the grace of God, in him who reads according to the state of innocence and love in which he finds himself (Arcana Coelestia §1767, §1776). In the words of this world, then, the measureless wisdom of the angels lies hidden. We attain to that wisdom when, after death, we are transformed into an angel by God's grace (Doctrine of Sacred Scripture §75). It appears superfluous to me to appeal to other cita­ tions to establish the central role that Swedenborg attributes to the Word. It gathers the divine light into itself; it constitutes the link be­ tween humanity and angels, between the angels and God. But this di­ vine light is only accessible to the person who turns in love toward God. For every other reader, the Word remains a dead letter. 237"

Yet it was only officially fixed in its dogma by his True Christian Religion, which appeared in 1771, the year preceding his death. All of Swedenborg 's prior works only give us fragments or brief overviews of its essential dogmas without detailed argumentation. As we have seen, Swedenborg initially believed that his mission consisted of explaining the hidden sense of the holy Word to human­ ity. This mission was extended only step by step toward the institu­ tion of a New Church and the proclamation of a new doctrine. It finished by identifying this mission with the announced return of the Messiah to the earth, a return that would take place this time, not in a personal form, but by the explication of the Word. Swedenborg himself would serve as the human instrument. This explains why a number of the dogmas of the New Church found their definitive formulation relatively late in the works of its founder. In Swedenborg's first exegesis, edited by Tafel under the title of Adversaria, most of the dogmatic questions are still at the same point as in The Worship and Love of God. Beginning with the Arcana Coelestia, however, Swedenborg starts to expound his unorthodox doctrines on the Trinity, the doctrine of redemption, etc. These doc­ trines reappear in a more developed form in the systematic later works. 238"

Naturally, only in a study of that nature would one find the integral explication of the stages that led him to his definitive concept. But research of this nature would require an entire volume in itself, so I must limit myself here to the study of Swedenborgian theology in its definitive form. Even in this limited domain, I shall address only the doctrines that appear to me to be characteristic of Swedenborg's mysticism and that can be con­ sidered as the culmination of his prior speculations. It would be use­ less to give a summary of the theology of the New Church here, since Sweden borg expounded its fundamental dogmas with all desirable clarity. A truly fruitful study of his historical and dogmatic point of view can, of course, be done only by a specialist in this field. Passing on from his philosophy of nature to his theological writ­ ings, one is struck by the concordance between them in the minutest details. There is hardly a single thesis in Economy of the Animal King­ dom that has not been used in the theological works. Already in the commentaries on the first chapters of Genesis in the Arcana Coelestia, we find a veritable recapitulation of Swedenborg's old psychological schema. A more attentive examination, however, confirms that the system has acquired more unity, that it attaches itself more closely to some fundamental ideas that have always predominated in Sweden­ borg's mind, and that it ends in bolder conclusions. The point of view one frequently finds among lay commentators-that during his theo­ logical period Sweden borg reasoned in a less liberal fashion than previously, since he had to subordinate his thinking to the Bible­ neglects the central fact that Swedenborg had always considered the Bible as the ultimate authority. In fact, while he was previously obliged to reconcile his own ideas with biblical teachings, thanks to his allegorical exegesis, he be­ comes independent of the sacred text. No doubt it is necessary that his doctrine agree with the \"hidden sense\" of the Bible, but we have seen to what extent this hidden sense takes the form of his own views. The more he is convinced that he has been given a mission to pro­ claim a new religion, the more he naturally feels himself free from orthodox dogma.

I shall first address the problem that had been most prominent in his mind since his philosophical period: that of God and of his re­ lationship with the world, as well as his spiritual relationship with humankind. We recall that, in his first work of religious philosophy, the Prodromus, Swedenborg, like the Neoplatonic mystics, already tended to conceive of God as beyond all determination and existing above all human thought. He had on the whole preserved this view of the Divinity during his intermediate period and had even devel­ oped it by connecting it with the Neoplatonic emanationist doctrine. During his period of crisis, however, he met the Deity under quite another form-more concretely. He believed he saw Christ himself and that he had conversed with him. On several occasions, he had felt that his thoughts and feelings were influenced by the \"power of the spirit.\" These are the personal experiences that, to a certain de­ gree, have determined the new doctrine he proclaims regarding the Trinity. Swedenborg begins by denying all determinability to God. He distinguishes between the divine Being (esse) and the divine Essence (essentia); the former is more universal than, and the necessary condi­ tion of, the latter. In its absolute sense, \"the divine being, which is Je­ hovah,\" is beyond all thought and every conceivable thing: The esse of God ... is impossible to define, because it transcends every idea of human thought, since this can take in only what is created and finite, and not what is uncreate and infinite, ... the Divine esse. The Divine esse is Being itself, from which all things are, and which must be in all things in order that they may have being.(True Christian Religion §18) The divine Being constitutes the very substance and the very form. Angels and humans are of the substances and of the forms of God and are his image in the measure that they are in him and he is in them (True Christian Religion §20). The divine Being is being and existence in itself. It cannot be said to be being by itself, the expression \"by itself' implying the idea of duration. That would amount to 240"

Indeed, according to Swedenborg, this is the source of the absurdity of the orthodox dogma of the Trinity. The di­ vine Being could not create another deity who would be both being and existence in himself, and hence the dogma of three equal persons within the Divinity is necessarily false (True Christian Religion §23). Needless to say, much of this conception of divine Being accords with the declarations of Plotinus on the first principle. For him also, God is, in his absolute importance, above all thought and all being. He is himself uncaused and the absolute cause of everything finite. The sole attribute that one can ascribe to the divine Being, then, is absolute \"infinitude,\" an infinitude that surpasses all finite reason. The \"ancients tell us the story of a philosopher who threw himself into the sea because he could neither see nor conceive, in the light of his reason, of the eternity of the world; what would he then have done if he had tried to conceive the eternity of God?\" It is conse­ quently vain to seek to learn the nature of God in his being or in his substance: it is enough to know him according to created things in the bosom of which he exists in an eternal form (True Christian Reli­ gion §28). From the moment one renounces the search for the divine being, to try to create a concept of the essence of God, the attributes that are recognized in him become infinite. The infinite that exists in God and emanates from him relate above all to two attributes: love and wisdom. Divine love and divine wisdom are life itself, \"the sun of spiritual life at the center of which Jehovah is found\" (see True Christian Religion §§36-39). We thus return to Swedenborg's fundamental philosophical concept. I shall show below how it develops during the theological period. But before this demonstration, I shall comment briefly on the notion of the Trinity. In his absolute being, Jehovah is not even conceivable for the an­ gels of the highest heaven; for the angels are finite, and no finite being can conceive of the infinite. The first manifestation of God con­ sists in that, in pronouncing the Word, he penetrated heaven, and this penetration by Jehovah gave heaven a human form. By means of this 241"

But when humanity came to the point of turn­ ing from God, the Deity, in the form of the \"Man-God,\" lost his in­ fluence. God then assumed the purely human form by birth from a woman, just like an ordinary human (Arcana Coelestia §3062, §6280, §lOS79). Thus, Jehovah himself descended toward the earth and took on the human form to ransom and save humankind. It is a mistake to believe that God, Creator of the universe, should have, from all eter­ nity, engendered a Son. His objective is the annihilation of the hells, the ordering of the heavens, and the establishment of the Church. \"And this work, God could realize only, in his omnipotence, through the human being, in that no one could do anything if he had no arm\" (True Christian Religion §84). For the omnipotence of God operates according to the law of divine order, to which he has subjected him­ self (see the following chapter). And this is why, to become truly a man, he must be conceived, carried in the womb of a woman, be born, and grow little by little in intelligence and wisdom, just like other humans. The human being through whom God himself descended to earth is called the Son of God. He took from his mother her purely human quality, while his soul (anima) was of divine origin. Here Swedenborg appeals to his old traducianist theory that the human body emanates from the woman, while the soul is transmitted in the sperm of the father (True Christian Religion §89, §92). The fact that in the Bible the Lord calls Jehovah God his Father, and the latter calls him Son, only confirms that the divine being of the Father is his soul and life, just as each in­ fant has his life and his soul from his father (True Christian Religion §82). By the temptations to which he submitted himself and over which he triumphed, the Lord transformed his human self into a di­ vine being during his incarnation. He thus cleansed successively the human being he had from his mother and clothed a human form with the divinity he had within him. \"And in this manner God be­ came man, and the man became God in a single person\" (True Chris­ tian Religion §101).

The doctrine of salvation by faith alone has masked the essential point of the doctrine of the Church: that Je­ hovah descended to earth and took human form. Nonetheless, it is only by this conjunction that a human being can enter into a relation­ ship with God and thus realize his salvation. It is evident that this strange conception of God is a mixture of Christian and Kabbalistic doctrines. In the Kabbalah, God is, in his pure essence, absolutely undetermined and inconceivable. \"Before he had created a form in this world, before he had produced an image, he was alone, formless, without resemblance to anything whatsoever. And how could anyone, before the creation, conceive him as he was, since he had no form?\" To reveal itself, the divine light that filled all things had to concentrate itself in the human form, the norm of every created thing. The first emanation from God is the primitive man, Adam Kadmon, who is also called Logos, or the Son of God. He is the prototype of the entire creation. The heavenly man is the vehicle by which Jehovah descends into the universe which has emanated from him. And the earthly man has been created in the image of this celestial man.227 Consequently, the Kabbalists join a purely abstract concept of God, like that of the Neoplatonists, with an extremely concrete notion of the divine manifestation in human form. Like Swedenborg, they speak of different parts of God's body. Kabbalistic philosophers of nature in the Renaissance accepted these two con­ cepts of God and did their best to reconcile them with orthodox Christian dogma. Such is notably the case with Pico della Mirandola. Swedenborg, then, rejects the doctrine according to which God would be, from all eternity, given a son, a doctrine he considers as contrary to all reason as that of the Platonic doctrine of preexistence, which he has never been able to accept despite his marked adherence to Platonism. \"That a Son of God begotten from eternity descended and assumed a human [form] may be compared to the fables of the ancients, that human souls created at the beginning of the world enter into bodies and become men\" (True Christian Religion §171). And it is by the same reasoning that he also eliminates the third per­ son of the Trinity. The Holy Spirit is the divine truth and divine 243"

Instead of the orthodox conception of the Trinity, which, ac­ cording to Swedenborg, makes us worship three gods when we con­ fess our faith in one, Swedenborg teaches that the holy Trinity is composed of three parts (essentialia) of a single and identical Being, parts joined among themselves, such as soul, body, and activity in hu­ mans, to which they correspond (True Christian Religion §166). This Trinity did not preexist at the creation of the world; it only appeared later when God himself came down to earth in human form, and was, by the will of God, realized in the Lord God, the Redeemer and Savior Jesus Christ (True Christian Religion §170). It is, then, to him alone that Christians should turn. The analogies between the Swedenborgian conception of the Trinity and the Monarchian modalism of the second century C.E. has often been underscored by the theologians who have studied Swedenborg. It is thus partly similar to teachings of Praxeas, accord­ ing to which the Father himself was born of the virgin and suffered on the cross. With the Son, then, he constitutes a single identical per­ son and bears the name of Son by reason of his body and Father by reason of his spirit. The doctrine also presents certain analogies with Sabellianism, according to which the Deity manifests itself succes­ sively as Father, as Son, and as Spirit. A certain concordance has also been pointed out between the Christology of Swedenborg and the doctrine proclaimed during the fourth century by the heretic bishop Apollinaris of Laodicea, who sustained the belief that, with the Christ, only the body and the vegetative soul were of human nature, while the spirit was represented by Logos himself.228 As far as I can judge, there exists no systematic concordance be­ tween the Swedenborgian doctrine and these diverse doctrines. It ap­ pears plausible, however, that Swedenborg had some knowledge of them and that he may have received some inspiration from these sources. That this might actually be the case is further indicated by the fact that Swedenborg constantly pointed out that the dogma of the Trinity in three persons was inaugurated by the Council of Nicea and that the former apostolic Church had no knowledge of it.

Since his first work, it is toward the divine infinite that he di­ rects his adoration. His religious impulse consisted, in a more or less conscious fashion, in a pantheistic tendency to conjoin himself with the Divinity, to lose himself in the universal All, to feel himself to be a spark of the divine sun. The visions of his period of crisis had largely failed to draw him more closely to the historical personality of Jesus Christ. They had simply imposed upon him the obligation of representing the Divinity to himself in a human form. This need could in no way be satisfied by the orthodox doctrine of the Trinity, which disappointed the requirements of his imagination for a clear and concrete image. \"Whoever seeks to visualize this triarchy or cre­ ate for himself a visual image in the eyes of reason (coram visu mentis), at the same time invoking this unity of three persons, fails to fix this concept in his contemplation otherwise than in the form of a three­ headed body or a head with three bodies.\" It is in these terms that in True Christian Religion (§171) Swedenborg expounds his critique of the Athanasian Creed regard­ ing the Trinity. His own doctrine allows him, in full accord with his visionary requirements, to conceive of God as a perfectly visible human figure: ... being a man, [God] has a body and everything pertaining to it, ... a face, breast, abdomen, loins and feet; for without these he would not be a man. And having these, he also has eyes, ears, nose, mouth, and tongue; also the parts within man, as the heart and lungs, and their dependencies, all of which taken together make man to be a man. (Divine Love and Wisdom §18) God is the only true human, and it is only by him that human beings, created in his image, know that he is a man (Arcana Coelestia §3061). 245"

It has been objected against this solution of the problem of the Trinity that the dilemma that Swedenborg had hoped to avoid in re­ fusing to admit the doctrine of three persons in the Divinity contin­ ues to arise as long as it is a matter of incorporating the distinct parts of the Being into one sole person. 229 Such reasoning, however, ne­ glects the fact that the dualism between the divine soul and the human being of God incarnate finds its precise correspondence in Swedenborg's customary psychological system. In the Man-God, there exists the same antagonism between the inner being and the ex­ ternal being as among all humans, with the difference that, in his human form, God triumphs without yielding to any temptations and finally glorifies his human being, of which humans are incapable. This is the process that unites us with God and which, at the same time, constitutes the inimitable model for the regeneration of humanity. On the other hand, Swedenborg's critics are right in maintain­ ing that his doctrine completely effaces the personal traits of the fig­ ure of Christ and that his redemptive mission loses all the significance it possesses in the traditional Christian conception. But this is pre­ cisely one of the themes that has determined Swedenborg's rejection of the orthodox doctrine of the Trinity. Following his marked oppo­ sition to the dogma of salvation by faith alone, he was led step by step to condemn all the Christian dogmas related to it, notably original sin, divine wrath, and particularly the entire Christian doctrine of re­ demption. Jesus Christ did not come to this earth to appease divine wrath and redeem humanity by an expiatory sacrifice, and no one can count on salvation by invoking the intervention of Christ. 23o He de­ scended to earth in human form to combat the forces of hell, which had attained a frightful power as a consequence of generations of human sin, and to renew the relationship between man and God. The human being achieves salvation only after Christ's ascension, just as he previously attained it: by a life of self-purification. But now the way is smoothed by the fact that the evil spirits' hold on humankind has weakened and the equilibrium between heaven and hell has been reestablished.

We shall return to these ideas in dealing with Swedenborg's eschatology. Swedenborg's God, then, becomes the absolute infinity from which all things have proceeded and by which all things subsist. Hu­ mankind cannot, nor should it, represent this Being to themselves in any form other than that in which he manifested himself to them; that is, in the form of the original man, the universal man, whose soul is none other than the indeterminate divine Being and whose activity is the Holy Spirit. The consequences of this view, which has innumerable equiva­ lents in mystical and Gnostic doctrines, appear in a particularly strik­ ing manner in Swedenborg's doctrine of the creation and in his theories on the relationships between humans and God. Since God is the true and only substance, it is evident that there could not have coexisted with God any eternal matter from which he could have created the universe. Moreover, the universe could not have been created from nothing, since nothing can only produce nothing, and the notion of creating something from nothing is a con­ tradiction (True Christian Religion §76). There remains only one pos­ sibility: that God may have created the world from his own Being: The universe, ... which is God's image, and consequently full of God, could be created only in God from God; for God is esse it­ self, and from esse must be whatever is .... But still, that which is created in God from God is not continuous from him; for God is esse in itself, and in created things there is not any esse in itself. (Divine Love and Wisdom §55) As we see, Swedenborg persists in maintaining the transcen­ dence of God. He is fully aware that his doctrine reeks dangerously of pantheism. He says, \"Many have seen this, because reason causes them to see it; and yet they have not dared to confirm it, fearing lest they might thereby be led to think that the created universe is God, because from God, or that nature is from itself, and consequently that the inmost of nature is what is called God\" (Divine Love and Wisdom 247"

If they fail to decipher this enigma, it is because they have con­ sidered both creation and God himself on the basis of time and space, which are qualities of nature. 231 The world was not at all created by God in time, \"but time has been instituted by God by the fact of Cre­ ation\" (True Christian Religion §31). That is the very doctrine that St. Augustine professes. 232 In God and before God prior to the creation, neither space nor time existed; they appeared after this creation. Cre­ ation, then, cannot be considered as having been created from space to space or from time to time, that is, progressively and successively, but from eternity and infinity (Divine Love and Wisdom §156). After the creation, God himself is present in space without space and in time without time (True Christian Religion §30). To explain how the universe could emanate from God, the ab­ solute and indivisible unity, Swedenborg employs his doctrine of the divine-human essence of God. As with humans, in whom a multi­ tude of organs and body parts concur in forming a unity, \"the God­ Man\" constitutes a unity of infinite things at a still more elevated degree (Divine Love and Wisdom §17, §22). Desiring to put an end once again to all contradiction, Swedenborg considers creation not as a direct work of God, but as an operation mediately accomplished through the spiritual sun, which is not God himself but an emanation (procedens) proceeding from his wisdom and from his divine love. This sun contains innumerable things (indefinita) that ultimately, \"in their form of images, assume existence in the created universe\" (Di­ vine Love and Wisdom §155). Swedenborg thus attempts to realize a transition between absolute unity and the multiplicity of created things. The process itself by which the love and wisdom of God pro­ ceed in the spiritual sun, however, appears inexplicable, as Sweden­ borg acknowledges. He affirms that he has conversed with angels about this who said they had precise information regarding their spiritual light, but that this knowledge was difficult to communicate to the natural light of the human being. They tell us that, just as God is enveloped by the spiritual sun, they are themselves deep within a sphere of affections and spiritual thoughts that emanate from their own being (Divine Love and Wisdom §291). This spiritual sun, in turn, irradiates the divine light and heat with an intensity that decreases 248"

Natural things have also been created by the spiritual sun, al­ though not directly but through the mediation of the natural sun. This natural sun is in reality a dead sun, and all matter created by it is consequently dead. For the atmospheres lose their light and heat to the extent that they are distant from their original source. They end up becoming so condensed and inert that they are no longer atmo­ spheres but immobile and fixed, of the same nature as the terrestrial atmospheres, and are given the name of matter (Divine Love and Wis­ dom §§173-176, §302). Vegetation and animal life, following in order, have their distant origin in the spiritual sun. It is to the spiritual that they owe their form, and it is the spiritual that \"condenses\" (constipat) them, on the basis of earthly matter, to give them consistence and stability (Divine Love and Wisdom §340). Or, as Swedenborg says elsewhere, the spiri­ tual clothes itself with the natural. But for its existence, this spiritual has need of a permanent irradiation from the spiritual sun. And if the living power of this spiritual sun should fail them, the natural sun, of which the spiritual sun is the center, would immediately dissipate, and with it the entire solar world (Divine Love and Wisdom §157). Natural things, then, are only vessels that receive the light of the spiritual sun. Likewise the spiritual world, with its own sun, is in turn only a reflection of the divine Being itself: But although the Divine is in each and all things of the created universe, there is in their esse nothing of the Divine in itself; for the created universe is not God, but is from God; and since it is from God, there is in it an image of him like the image of a man in a mirror, wherein indeed the man appears, but still there is nothing of the man in it.

But one could then ask, if Swedenborg denies the preexistence of matter that might serve as material for the divine creation and if he refuses to conceive a creation from nothing, how does he succeed in explaining the manifestation of a universe apart from the Creator? How are the atmospheres formed that gradually diminish the light and heat of the spiritual sun? How can the light from this spiritual sun really be attenuated when there is no matter to traverse and when it cannot even lose itself in the darkness, which, according to Plotinus and his innumerable successors, is equivalent to nothing in the absence of light? How can mortal vessels be created in which the divinity will ultimately be reflected? Sweden borg believes the response to these questions is found in his doctrine of degrees, which, in the philosophy of his later years, as­ sumes a more constitutive significance than earlier. As I have indi­ cated above, this doctrine is modified in the sense that the number of degrees, which was originally arbitrary in each series, is now limited to three mutually related ones: those of end, cause, and effect. Even more important than this modification, which already appears in the last part of his scientific period, is the fact that these degrees which, in Economy of the Animal Kingdom, had the exclusive goal of demon­ strating the evolution of nature, here take on a universal application. 250"

But Swedenborg later denies the existence of an absolutely simple created substance: It is asserted by some that there is a substance so simple as not to be composed of lesser forms and that from conglomerations (coacervationes) of this substance are produced derivative or composite substances, and finally those which are called mate­ rial. But no such absolutely simple substances exist. Indeed, what would substance be without a form? (Divine Love and Wis­ dom §229) To find a substance that has no relation to higher and more simple substances, we must follow the chain to God himself. Nevertheless, even with God, the divine Being alone is of pure form. Unity and multiplicity coexist in God. He is not only infinite from the fact that he is being and existence in himself, he is equally so because he con­ tains the infinite in himself (quia infinita in Ipso sunt; Divine Love and Wisdom § 17). Swedenborg does not hesitate thereafter to make a se­ ries of the Divinity-the highest of all the series. Of his uncreated de­ grees, the third, the natural degree, only existed in a potential state until God clothed himself in a purely human form and became thereby \"a man similar to the men of this world\" (Divine Love and Wisdom §233). Since the end, cause, and effect exist in God, they must also exist in everything in the universe, in the least as in the greatest (Divine Love and Wisdom §169). Both the spiritual world and the natural world owe their origin and existence to these degrees (Divine Love and Wisdom §155). In any case, these degrees are \"discrete\" and not continuous, for the cause cannot be identical with its effect. They are distinct, one being identical with its effect. They are distinct, one from the other, like prior and posterior degrees, like the creation of the form and the form itself (Divine Love and Wisdom §185). For Swedenborg, this evolution also implies an evolution from the simple to the composite, and consequently from the higher to the lower de­ gree. For primitive objects, as more simple, are more \"naked\" and 251"

A muscle is composed of grosser motor fibers that are formed in turn of fasces of finer fibers. This triune order is also found in every domain of nature; we can, then, conclude that it equally governs the things that escape our eyes (Divine Love and Wisdom §190-191). The end thus engenders the cause and thereby the effect, which must manifest the end (Divine Love and Wisdom §189). It is evident, then, that the end governs the cause and the effect, or, as Swedenborg says, \"that the end is wholly in the cause and wholly in the effect.\" One can, therefore, just as well designate end, cause, and effect as the initial, mediate, and ultimate end. But in order that the end may also inhere in the cause and effect, it is necessary that these contain some­ thing of this end in which it might operate (Divine Love and Wisdom §168). We thus see that the creative act of God reproduces itself on every level of creation. Just as the spiritual sun surrounds itself with atmospheres in order to be able to extend its heat and light through their intermediation, likewise each end seeks to create a cause and an effect to attain its own realization. \"For every end without a cause, or independent of any cause, would have no existence, being no more than a word\" (Divine,Love and Wisdom § 167). When we classify mat­ ter as inert, we conceive it as an effect. But every effect becomes again a cause in another series or, as Swedenborg says, all \"fines ultimi\" re­ turn as new ''fines primi\"; accordingly, there is nothing so inert and dead that it does not possess an active force. \"Etiam ex arena exspirat tale, quod confert opem ad aliquid producendum, ita ad aliquid efficien­ dum\" (Divine Love and Wisdom §172).235 But while the created ends unconsciously pursue the creative act, the creative act itself is a conscious one. And that is why the uni­ versal end of the creation (Finis universalis seu omnium creation is) can only be realized by the creation of conscious beings, in whom the Di­ vinity can elect to reside \"as by itself.\" Such beings can receive the love and wisdom of God \"as from themselves\" and can raise them­ selves towards the Creator and conjoin themselves with him \"as of themselves.\" This conjunction of human beings with God is the ulti­ mate goal of creation, and it follows that the creation exists for 252"

Thus, creation is elevated by degrees from the lowest things up to hu­ mankind, and through us to God, from whom we emanate (Divine Love and Wisdom §85). This situation of humankind as the supreme goal of the uni­ verse explains the evolution that the ancient doctrine of the micro­ cosm and macrocosm has undergone in Swedenborg's theology. \"Man was called a microcosm by the ancients because he reflected the macrocosm, representing the universe in all its extent.\" But at present it is not known why humankind is so called, for there is nothing of the macrocosm in us except the fact that we are born from the animal and vegetable kingdoms, that by our bodies we live in this macro­ cosm, perceive its light, and breathe its atmospheres; but these rea­ sons are insufficient to qualify us as a microcosm. This name had been given humankind by the ancients because they were aware of the doctrine of correspondences and found themselves in contact with celestial angels. \"For the angels of heaven know, from all they see around them, that every thing in the universe, considered from the point of view of its utility, reflects the man in a single image\" (quod omnia universi quoad usus spectata, referant in imagine hominem; Divine Love and Wisdom §319). Because the entire universe is at the service of humanity, the human organism .becomes a norm for all created things. All the king­ doms of nature offer analogies with human beings: animals by their anatomical structure, their drives and their tendencies; vegetation by its development from a germ and by its reproduction; minerals, fi­ nally, by the fact that they nurture the germ and permit it to sprout. This tendency of nature toward the human form is only vaguely per­ ceptible to us during our earthly lives, but we perceive it clearly once we are elevated to the spiritual world. For this spiritual world reflects the representations of the three kingdoms, and the new angel who finds himself in the midst of them perceives them around him. When the deepest levels of his own reasoning open up to them, he recog­ nizes himself therein and sees his own image as in a mirror (Divine Love and Wisdom §63). 253"

Hell and the world of spirits, seen as a whole, have the form of a human being. Thus, it is that, finally, all the heavens together form \"the greatest man\" (maxim us homo). But terrestrial souls do not at all suffice to form this \"greatest man.\" All the planets of our solar system are peopled by humans who later enter the heavens in the form of an­ gels, and this is the reason each planet corresponds to a part of this maxim us homo. In nature, we find at each level organic forms, great and small, and their structure and activity present certain analogies with hu­ mankind. It is in the human being, the ultimate end of creation, that God realizes his own image. He is the microcosm, not only because all other created substances are in his service and mediately con­ tribute to his formation, but also because, with the human being, every part of the body, every organ, every faculty has its correspon­ dence in the maxim us homo in the kingdom of God and, conse­ quently, its still higher correspondence in the Man-God himself. And this is possible because \"in God-man there are infinite things which appear in heaven, in angel, and in man, as in a mirror\" (Divine Love and Wisdom §21). This concept of the human figure as the norm of every created thing and the very form of the Eternal is found, in Swedenborg's the­ ology, applied with the systematic minuteness that characterizes him. He refuses to hesitate before any consequences, however paradoxical they may appear to be. He gives a detailed description of the sites in the heavenly or infernal person that are occupied by the diverse spir­ itual societies; in his work on the role of the terrestrial globe in our solar system, the spirits on each planet represent a part of the body or a faculty of the maxim us homo. Like the doctrine of correspondences and heavenly marriage, this teaching has become one of the most re­ markable parts of the Swedenborgian system. Kant early gave a cari­ catural exposition of it and qualified it as a \"monstrous and extravagant fantasy\" (eine ungeheure und reisenmiissige Phantasie). It was later invoked as proof of Swedenborg's mental derangement. Partisans as well as adversaries of the Swedish mystic seem to admit that he himself came to it as a kind of inversion of the microcosmic man thesis. It is nothing of the sort.

Plato and Aristotle had previously represented the world as a living entity; among the Stoics, this doctrine, which certainly has ex­ tremely ancient origins, was joined to that of microcosmic man. Philo declared that the Stoics called the human being the \"little universe\" and the universe the \"grand man.\"236 In Hermes Trismegistus, the complete world resides in the form of a man provided with a body, a soul, and of all their constituent parts, physical and psychic. 237 This conception is found later in the Kabbalistic doctrine of Adam Kad­ mono For the Kabbalists, the original divine being is also the macro­ cosm that includes all created things: \"The Form of man contains all that exists in heaven and on earth, superior beings as well as inferior . ... No form, no world, could preexist the human form; for it includes everything; all that is, only exists by it, without it the universe would not exist.\"238 The combination of these two elements-the ancient concept of the universe as a living being and the Kabbalistic doctrine of Adam Kadmon-is found already realized in a fully conscious manner in the Renaissance philosopher Cornelius Agrippa. He expounds in de­ tail the different parts of the body of God mentioned in the Bible and by the Kabbalists as constituting the primitive images, the \"ideas\" of corresponding parts of the human body. Aligning himself directly with Hermes Trismegistus, he maintains that not only humankind but also the entire universe has been created in the image of God and that, consequently, this universe constitutes a living being endowed with reason.239 Certain other Kabbalistic philosophers apply the name of max­ imus homo directly to the universe. Such is the case, for example, with Pico della Mirandola, who proclaims the audacious thesis that Moses has made use of this expression already in Genesis and who expounds in abundant detail how the heaven of the angels corresponds to the head of the maxim us homo, the firmament to the part of the trunk from the neck to the navel, while our sublunary world constitutes the lower half of the trunk and the extremities. 24o Likewise, Paracelsus maintains that, since all earthly matter has contributed to form the human organism, the human being is the microcosm and, inversely, 255"

Thus it follows that man is heaven and earth, air and water in knowledge).241 However, even admitting that elements of this doctrine can be found more or less everywhere, with astrological or magical applica­ tions, in the philosophy of nature, ancient or modern, and in the doc­ trine of correspondences, we cannot deny Swedenborg a certain originality in his handling of ancient ideas. With him, these elements become, in their systematic doctrinal development, a means of satis­ fying his tendency to conceive of everything in an organic form. Everything in nature has relation to humanity; all tends, with a greater or lesser measure of perfection, towards the human form. This is true, not only for the animal and vegetable kingdoms, but also for minerals. The earth receives the seed in its bosom and makes it germinate, the ocean depths nourish the corals, and the minerals of the mines nourish the flowers. Every kingdom of nature tends to­ ward the realm directly above it, because the human image exists in every natural form (Divine Love and Wisdom §§61-62, §317). It follows that all natural processes should be considered by analogy with human processes. Every tendency becomes love, all cos­ mic conjunction becomes marriage. There is nothing that does not have a place assigned to it as part of the human body. Above our visi­ ble universe, the human form attains proportions that are more and more gigantic. Angels and spirits, heaven and hell, all display the human form; finally, all the terrestrial globes of our solar world and all the societies of the heavens are united to constitute the greatest of created forms, the maxim us homo. In this manner, all creation, from the highest to the lowest, forms a mirror image of God's proper hu­ manness. Each form reflects the Infinite and the Eternal (Divine Love and Wisdom §318). Swedenborg has indeed traveled a long way since the time when he considered the earth as a great machine. As we have seen, Swedenborg refused to admit the existence of any matter that did not have its origin in God; he cannot identify matter with evil, as Plotinus has done. We know that Plotinus 256"

It is manifestly against this contra­ dictory reasoning 242 that Swedenborg says, in a conversation with two angels (Conjugial Love §444): Do you not know that there is good and evil, that good and not evil is from creation, and yet evil, viewed in itself, is not nothing although it is nothing of good. Good has existed since the cre­ ation, a good of a higher degree and a good of a lower degree as well; and when this inferior good becomes nothing, the evil arises [exsurgit] from the other side. There is therefore no rela­ tion between good and evil, nor progression of good to the evil but a progression of goodness and one of evil, for they are throughout in constant opposition. The two angels then ask him how evil could have originated since it did not proceed from the creation and the good decrease to the point of becoming evil, Sweden borg replies: That is a secret which cannot be revealed unless one knows that nothing is good but the Lord alone, that apart from God there is no good that is good in itself; that is why anyone who looks to God and wishes to let himself be led by God is in good, but he who turns from God and wishes to lead himself is not in good; for the good he does is either done for himself or for the world; this good is either meritorious or simulated and hypocritical, from which it is plain that the man himself is the origin of evil, not that this origin is inherent in man from creation, but that he has imposed it on himself by turning from God. So Swedenborg categorically rejects the doctrine of an evil exist­ ing in the creation itself before the Fall. \"It is criminal to think that God himself created evil\" (True Christian Religion §490). And he equally denies that evil is only an imperfection of the good and even that this imperfection is a condition of the birth of evil. All the evil that exists in the creation has its first source in the original sin that man committed from his own will. 257"

Ani­ mals harmful to humankind, tigers, serpents, crocodiles, harmful in­ sects, poisonous minerals or plants, do not proceed from God and are not part of the original creation; they have issued from hell and are distant progeny of the Fall of Man (Divine Love and Wisdom §§338-339). All these harmful animals and poisonous plants corre­ spond in hell to the putrefied substances of urine and excrement. However, as humanity, by persevering in sin and evil, must be supposed to exercise free will, without which we would be led by the omnipotent Divine, so also harmful animals and inanimate sub­ stances are to be considered as having a kind of freedom of choice that equips them to do harm. Swedenborg declares in True Christian Religion (§491): The fact that God has granted freedom, not only to man, but also to animals and, even to a certain extent, to inanimate things, in the sense that he has given every thing the faculty of receiving this liberty conformingly with its nature and that he has im­ planted good in everything, and this good having, nevertheless, been turned into evil, is easily explained by the following com­ parisons: ... The oceans provide asylum in their kingdom for all the fish, but they cannot be responsible because one fish eats an­ other, nor that the crocodile transforms his nourishment into a poison which enables him to kill a man. The sun dispenses its light and heat to all creatures, but these things, which are the di­ verse vegetation of the earth, receive them in different ways; a useful tree or bush receives this light and heat otherwise than do the thorny brambles, an inoffensive plant otherwise than a poi­ sonous plant. We see, then, that in his ardor to deny God any part in the exis­ tence of evil in the world, Swedenborg paradoxically has the birth of evil from original sin committed by virtue of free will-of a free will that is above all the lot of humankind, but which in a certain measure has been also given to every created thing, even inanimate things. It is quite evident that the problem is not resolved thereby in any way. It remains to be shown how humans could sin although they have been 258"

It is interesting to observe that Swedenborg here finds himself constrained to return to the reasonings of Plotinus. He pic­ tures the Fall as less of a revolt against God or a positive willful act than as a slow detachment, a progressive estrangement from the Di­ vinity. This explains why Swedenborg interpreted the account of the Fall given in Genesis as applying, not to the first human pair, but to the progressive decay of the human species until the Flood (cf. chap­ ter seven). It stands out in one of his most beautiful memorabilia that Swedenborg was fully aware of finding himself, by this reasoning, on Neoplatonic ground. The scene takes place in the Atheneum in the spiritual world, where all the sages of antiquity are gathered and, where, crowned with laurels, they discuss the gravest questions of philosophy in the octagonal salon of the Palladium. One of the philosophers, standing in the center of the Palla­ dium, with a palm leaf in his hand, then said: Explain, I beg you, by what mystery man, created in the image of God, is able to see his form transformed into that of a demon. I know that the an­ gels of heaven are forms of God and those of hell forms of the demon. I also know that these two forms are antagonists, these latter being folly and the former wisdom. Tell me, then, how man, created as a form of God, has been able to pass from light to such darkness that he has renounced his God and the life eternal? The teachers responded in order, first the Pythagore­ ans, then the disciples of Socrates, and finally the rest of the philosophers. But among them there was a certain Platonist who was the last to speak: It is his explication that prevailed and this was as follows: During the Saturn ian, or the golden age, men knew that they were forms receptive of life from God; also that wisdom was inscribed in their hearts and in their souls, so that by the light of the truth, they perceived what is true and that, through verities, they perceived the good from the delight per­ taining to the love of good. But, in the measure that the human species ceased, in the course of time, to recognize that all truth and wisdom, and consequently all the good which love requires, 259"

For the interior of their sentiments which was initially elevated toward God by God, deviated more and more obliquely toward the world, thus going to God from God by way of the world to take finally the opposite direction, which is toward what is lower and towards oneself. And as God could not be perceived by a man turned away from the divinity and perverted in the recesses of his mind, men detached themselves from God and became forms of hell, and thus forms of the devil. (True Christian Religion §692) When Sweden borg put these words in the mouth of a Platonist, he was probably thinking of Plotinus's celebrated description of the Fall. \"From whence,\" he asks, \"comes it that the souls who have their being in the upper world and belong definitively to this world, have forgotten God, their Father, and have thus come to know him no longer, and no longer know themselves?\" Plotinus finds the origin of evil in their excessive pride and in their desire to belong to them­ selves. \"They thus rejoice in their own glory, from the fact that they move outside themselves. While on the opposite road, separating themselves a long way, they lost the notion of their celestial origin; like children early separated from their parents and raised far from them for a long time, coming to know neither themselves nor their fathers.\"243 And Plotinus shows how, after having lost the sense of their origin and their own selfhood, these souls attach themselves more and more to things of the sensory world. As we see, this reason­ ing is identical to that of Swedenborg: the fall of the soul consists in attaching itself to earthly existence, forgetting its celestial origin. Sweden borg thus believes he can explain the appearance of evil without God's participation. But it remains for him to explain the persistence of this evil. The old question remains: does God permit evil? Or does he not have the power to erase it? To a certain degree, Swedenborg responds affirmatively to the second of these questions. But he hopes to rescue the dogma of omnipotence of God by adher­ ing to the doctrine of Malebranche on divine order. 260"

God cannot, like a capricious tyrant, act arbitrarily, contrary to all reason and all justice. Being himself reason and justice, he is committed to a law he rigorously observes. This is the immutable law of order. God himself is the order.244 This is precisely Swedenborg's view. \"It is generally considered today that the omnipotence of God is analogous to the absolute authority exercised by a king in this world, who can act as he pleases at will, absolve or condemn whoever he wishes, etc.\" (True Christian Religion §57). But God being the very substance, love and wisdom themselves, is at the same time order itself (True Chris­ tian Religion §53). Power and will are only one in him, and God being unable to wish otherwise than good can only do good (True Christian Religion §56). This thought will exercise a considerable influence on Sweden­ borg's view of God's relation to creation. The cause of th(\" creation of the universe lies in the nature of divine love, which is to love others and to render each happy from oneself (True Christian Religion §§43-46). This, then, is the execution of the immutable law of the being of him who has created the world. His omnipotence is manifest and operates in everyone and in everything according to the preestab­ lished laws of order (True Christian Religion §56). He has endowed humanity with free will in order that we make use of it to conjoin ourselves with him. Although we have turned away from him, God, remaining faithful to the preestablished order, cannot lead us to him without our cooperation. From this absurd concept of the omnipotence of God it would follow that he would have the power to transform every goat into a sheep, according to his fancy could move someone from his left to his right; to transform spirits of the dragon into angels of St. Michael, to give to the understanding of the mole the vi­ sion of the eagle, to make a dove from an owl. These things are not in the power of God because they are contrary to preestab­ lished order, although he unceasingly wills to effect them.

Furthermore, Cod cannot act contrary to his own order: he can­ not condemn a person, throw anyone into hell, predestine a soul to eternal death, avenge inequities, allow himself to become angry or to punish. He cannot even turn himself away from a human being and look upon him or her with severity (True Christian Religion §56). The Creator follows the immutable divine order, the operating plan of creation, in its minutest details. And this plan implies that ~very created thing shall one day return to God, and there shall exist m eternal bond between the Creator and the universe he has created. This plan requires the existence of beings in whom this Divinity may dwell as in his own self. And this is why these beings receive his love and his wisdom as though coming from themselves; they are to raise themselves toward the Creator as of themselves and conjoin them­ selves with him. No union is possible without this reciprocity. Only human beings possess this faculty, and this is why the entire creation exists only for humankind. The earth is destined to be a seminary where angels prepare themselves for heaven, which is the end of cre­ ation (Divine Love and Wisdom §§167-170, §§329-330). God approaches each person to the degree that the latter ap­ proaches God. He shines his light on humanity to the degree that we acquire truth. He loves us to the degree that we raise ourselves to him in love. Such is the law of divine order, which the Divinity himself cannot contravene. \"God can, in conformity with his own laws, only pardon a man for his sins to the extent that man renounces them in conformity with his own laws. God can only regenerate a man spiri­ tually insofar as the man regenerates himself naturally in accordance with his own laws\" (True Christian Religion §73). As one sees, Swedenborg's conception of the purpose of creation is, in substance, that which he expounds in Economy of the Animal Kingdom and the De Anima; we also find in these two works his de­ scription of the cooperation necessary between the Creator and the creature for the realization of these purposes.

There exists ab­ solutely no Satan in revolt against God, as the orthodox doctrine teaches. All the souls who populate hell and heaven are human souls, and by Satan the Bible simply means hell (Heaven and Hell §544). We find an identical development in Swedenborg's psychologi­ cal dissertations during his theosophical period. In itself, the funda­ mental construction is the same as previously; but while Swedenborg previously sought to conciliate the diverse philosophical schools and pursued a precarious reconciliation of his doctrine with the orthodox dogma, he now courageously draws all the consequences of his prem­ ises. He no longer needs the support of other doctrines; he has no longer any need to make himself the apologist of some already estab­ lished religious philosophy. It is directly from God that he has the revelation of the truth. The fundamental schema of his psychology remains, on the whole, visibly the same during the theological period. Nonetheless, the anima becomes more and more subordinated to the mens, of which it constitutes only a lower element. Like all the other series of the Swedenborgian doctrine, the human being includes three de­ grees: the anima, the mens, and the body. The anima receives divine influx directly from the spiritual sun, the mens receives it by way of the spiritual world, while it reaches the body through the intermedi­ ation of the natural world (Interaction between the Soul and Body §8). In discussing Swedenborg's visions, I have already indicated how the mens, which includes the will and the reason, is exposed to the influ­ ence of good and evil spirits. I pass over the further subdivisions found in Swedenborg's theological system of Sweden borg, as they are of only small importance in its conceptual totality. As before, Sweden borg interests himself particularly in the re­ ciprocal relationships of the various degrees of the human being.

His own psychological theory, expounded in the Economy of the Animal King­ dom, had justly been imagined to explain these relations. This theory, which rests upon the doctrine of degrees and which he calls the \"co­ established harmony\" (constabilitas), posits in principle that the lower degrees of soul and body are only determinations of the anima, which, as the primary substance of the human organism, governs the whole series. The soul is the form and life of the body, and this is why all the human functions have their origin in it. The body is only the instrument of the soul. \"It follows that it is the soul (anima) which understands, thinks, judges, desires, represents, aspires, remembers, sees, hears, perceives odors, feels, speaks, and acts\" (Economy of the Animal Kingdom II, §285). Swedenborg attempts by this declaration only to establish that the soul is present in the whole body. On the other hand, it allows no communication between the anima and the body (Animal Kingdom VII, §83). He conceives, however, a certain al­ ternate direct rapport between mens, animus, and body which he calls \"correspondence\" rather than \"influx.\" During his theosophical period, Swedenborg seeks to go a step further: he denies all influence of the body upon the soul and makes all knowledge of the anima emanate immediately from God. He says in Arcana Coelestia §6322: It appears to everyone as though the external senses, such as sight and hearing, flow into the thought and excite ideas there, for it seems that objects touch the senses, first the external and thereby the inner; ... but this appearance, however conclusive it may seem, is nevertheless an illusion, for what is external, mate­ rial and gross, cannot flow into and move the inner, pure and spiritual senses. That is contrary to nature. It is the inner senses, the very sense of the soul, which sensates through the external sense, and which dispose the external sensorium to receive the objects at its good pleasure. 264"

      "text": "GOD AND THE WORLD It is seen from a discussion between disciples of Aristotle, Descartes, and Leibniz, which is found at the end of the little volume The Interaction between the Soul and Body (§19) that Swedenborg ap­ pears to have changed his mind in this regard. To the exposition of their doctrine offered by the Aristotelians, the Cartesians reply: You reason according to appearances. Do you not know that the eye does not love a virgin or a bride from itself, but from the soul? Likewise the bodily senses do not covet the bag of silver from itself but only by the soul? And it is in the same way that the ears do not avidly receive the praises of flatterers in any other manner? Is it not perception that provokes sensation? And per­ ception is of the soul, not of the physical organ .... For these and many other analogous reasons everyone concludes, if his wis­ dom is above the sensual things of the body, that there exists no influx from the body to the soul, but truly an influx from the soul to the body, which we call influxus occasionalis and also in­ fluxus spiritualis. And in drawing on the various theories that follow, it is the Carte­ sians who win. Moreover, an angel proclaims that this outcome was not due to chance, but to the cooperation of providence. However it may be, Swedenborg does not regard his theory as entirely identical to that of the occasionalists. In several pages of his works, he declares that so far one has been constrained to deduce the \"infiuxus spiritualis\" of the soul to the body and not, as he intended, from God to the soul and from thence to the body. In reality, the sim­ ilarity between Swedenborg's doctrine and that of the occasionalists seems to me rather slight. As far as I can see, it is limited to this com­ mon point: like Swedenborg, the occasionalists classify the action of the body on the soul as pure appearance. At the same time, they cate­ gorically deny what Sweden borg terms infiuxus spiritualis, that is, di­ rect action by the soul on the body. For Swedenborg, on the contrary, this deep abyss between the soul and body does not exist. The body is but the envelope of the soul: the two only make one (Divine Love and Wisdom §386).245 To his mind, the difficulty consists much more in explaining how a human being can live a life of his or her own, since 265"

It is the spiritual sun that irradiates the human soul in which God has created a receptacle (receptaculum) for divine heat and love in the will, and a receptacle for divine light and wisdom in the mind. So, it is God himself who thinks and wills in us. Obviously, if Swedenborg had stopped there, he would have met with the same difficulties as Malebranche, who also professes a metaphysical occasionalism of this nature. God would then become responsible for all human errors. Swedenborg finds the solution in the theory of John Locke, according to which the human soul is, at birth, a tabula rasa. Were human knowledge innate, like the knowl­ edge and the instincts of animals, the human being would never at­ tain to a degree of perfection superior to what he or she has at birth, because \"the innate know ledges and sentiments of love limit this progress, while the simple innate faculties or tendencies set no bounds of this character.\" Consequently, humans are born without any knowledge at all, but with the faculty oflearning and with an in­ clination toward love. The fact that we are barren of knowledge at birth and that we progressively acquire it gives us the illusion that what we receive from God comes from our own resources: This conception has also been given to man by God in order that he may be a man and not an animal; for from the fact that he de­ sires, thinks, knows, understands, and possesses wisdom as of himself, accumulates knowledges, raises them to the rank of in­ sight (intelligentia) and by the use he makes of these, to that of wisdom. It is thus that God conjoins himself with man; and the man to God. This unity would have been impossible if God had not ordained that man should be born completely destitute of knowledges. (True Christian Religion §48[14]) If human beings could not appear to act from themselves, neither will nor reason would exist, nor would love or thought, and it follows that we could receive nothing of good or truth from God: \"Without this appearance there would be no rational conception of God, no charity and no faith, consequently no reformation and regeneration, and therefore no salvation\"(Divine Providence §174). 266"

Locke's theory of knowledge, nevertheless, finds a still more important place in Swedenborg's theological system. It is only because we have no innate ideas that we are human, that we are susceptible to more and more marked progress, and that we finally may come to realize the ulti­ mate end of creation, which is union with God. It follows that Swedenborg passes up no opportunity to combat the doctrine of innate ideas. In True Christian Religion §335[7], he re­ lates that it has been granted him to visit the spiritual world during a great discussion on innate concepts. This discussion was interrupted by an angel, who, in a loud voice, proclaimed to the assembly that no innate ideas existed. Animals are endowed with instincts, but not ideas, and with humans these only develop after birth. The fact that man does not possess innate ideas is clearly seen from the fact that the faculty of thought is not congenital. Now, where there is no thought, there could be no ideas, the two phe­ nomena being interdependent-a conclusion easy to pronounce if one visualizes the newly born as only capable of suckling and breathing .... His physical senses themselves are in the greatest confusion and it is from this confusion that he elevates himself little by little by means of objects. Also his movements become coordinated thanks to habit, and it is only progressively and in the measure that he learns to stammer words and use them with­ out connection with any idea of which he forms a confused image. This is clarified in turn and gives birth to a confused rep­ resentation which finally engenders a confused thought. In the course of this evolution, ideas are born which, as we have said above, only become one with the thought, so that this state, im­ plying no thought, is developed by instruction. And this is why man also has ideas which, in fact, are not connate but formed and it is from these ideas that they derive their discourse and actions. This speech produces a great impression on the hearers. \"Leib­ niz approached us and uttered words of consent, but Wolff departed 267"

No one knows how the Divinity acts in the depth of the soul, in the anima, just as no one knows by what process the anima gives vision to the eye, hearing to the ear, and articulation to the tongue and the mouth. These are among the things that escape the perception and the sensation of human being (Divine Providence §174). The genesis of our knowledge is, then, a real mystery to us. Our conceptual knowledge is only an appearance created by ourselves, and that of the anima escapes our consciousness. We know only one thing: it is the Divinity who operates within us without our knowing how. And it is a law of divine providence that we humans should not be capable of perceiving or sensing the providential action in our­ selves; for, if we had the faculty of perceiving or feeling it, we would lose all independent life and could no longer act in full freedom (Di­ vine Providence §176). But we can, through our reason, convince our­ selves that we are led by God. To the degree that we acquire this conviction, we are elevated by God toward the light of truth. Those who only confirm the appearance in themselves without confirming the truth at the same time cannot remove evils from themselves. But those who confirm the appearance and at the same time the truth in themselves are freed from all evil and all sin, apparently by their own strength, but really by God (Divine Providence §154). Only the an­ gels-particularly those of the third heaven, the highest of all-are susceptible of perceiving the influx of divine wisdom and love. They proclaim that they live from God and not from themselves, and they rejoice in life from God. Nevertheless, the appearance of living of themselves persists in them. It is even more marked than in other an­ gels. And Swedenborg affirms that he has found himself in that state for several years past (Divine Providence §158). Divine light and heat penetrate the soul of the human being si­ multaneously, but each of these is received in a different fashion. Di­ vine light can penetrate us in our three degrees, and we are susceptible of benefitting from a wisdom close to that of the angels. But divine heat-that is, love-can only suffuse us to the degree that 268"

Although he denies divine verities in his heart, he is nevertheless capable of understand­ ing them, talking of them and preaching them or even of writing scholarly confessions. Left to his own thoughts, however, the evil man thinks counter to these verities and denies them. For then infer­ nallove suffuses his soul and he only gives the name of verity to what accords with this love. Only by abstaining from sin with God's help and thus banishing the love of evil from his heart can the human being really succeed in acquiring divine light. For the divine light re­ mains powerless if not united with divine heat. The light of winter is as bright as that of summer, but is incapable of opening a seed or bud. It acquires this faculty when joined with the warmth of spring. It is only from the moment when divine love in a person unites with di­ vine wisdom that it flowers like a tree in spring (Divine Love and Wis­ dom §§244-246). As one sees, this account is identical to that of The Worship and Love of God. Reason teaches us how we ought to live; it leads the will and shows it the way to go, but does not direct it. The will directs the understanding and obliges it to act in absolute con­ junction with it (Divine Love and Wisdom §244). From the foregoing, we may conclude that our free will is in re­ ality an illusion. It is God who desires and acts in us. But God allows us to conceive the life he puts in us as our own in order that we may live as of ourselves according to the divine laws of order and that thus we may become capable of receiving the love of God. Every created thing, animate and inanimate, possesses a certain free will, but this free will is distinguished from ours in that we \"feel\" our life as if it were our own. Lacking this feeling, we could not effect our union with God; our aspirations could not rise to his; we would not even be men and would not possess an eternal life (True Christian Religion §504). Our freedom resides in the feeling we have of forcing our­ selves to do good and to tell the truth. We act in this manner to obey the orders of God and to save our souls after death. But behind these motives, an interior one is hidden, of which we are absolutely un­ aware: we do good for the kingdom of God and for God himself.

Those who have recourse to the knowledge that all good comes from God and that humans of themselves are incapable of doing good as a pretext for not imposing any compulsion upon themselves and for waiting in quiescent passiv­ ity for the influx from on high are destined to abandon themselves to evil without resistance. In the world of spirits, they will be counted as among the worthless (Arcana Coelestia §1937). This doctrine of human free will agrees, at least in its overall as­ pects, with the doctrine inspired by Malebranche, which Swedenborg had already supported in Economy of the Animal Kingdom. He repeats it several times in his theological works, accompanied by an ardent polemic against the orthodox Lutheran doctrine, according to which humanity, after the Fall, is entirely void of all moral fiber and retains the capacity to act in ordinary and natural things, but remains like an inert log in all spiritual and divine matters that are concerned with the salvation of the soul (see the extract from the Formula Concordiae in True Christian Religion §464). Swedenborg declares that we would not enjoy any free will in natural things if we did not possess a certain freedom in spiritual things, since the lower faculties of the soul have their origin in the higher faculties. He adds that, with the cessation of our free will, all will and all life would come to a close. \"If man were deprived of spir­ itual freedom, it would be as if the wheels were taken from machin­ ery, the fans from a windmill, or the sails from a vessel. It would even be as with one who in dying sends forth his last breath; for the life of man's spirit consists in his freedom of choice in spiritual things\" (True Christian Religion §482). Freedom is the lot of all humans, for the divine life also suffuses the good as well as the evil. The difference is that the good \"smooth the way and open the door,\" thus permitting the divine life to pene­ trate to the inferior faculties, while the evil close the door. This is why, among the evil, divine life cannot reach into the mens and tri­ umph over carnal desires that block the way; but it always exists in the anima.

We humans have never lost our free will; but after the creation, the human race has sinned in freedom. So hell was created, and thereby every person comes into the world with a tendency toward evil, a heredity transmitted in the sperm (True Christian Religion §469, §520ff.). As a consequence, along with this hereditary tendency toward evil and with the evil he has acquired by himself, each person has within him such evil aspirations that, were he not sustained by God, he would precipitate himself headlong into the depth of the hells. But God constantly wars with humanity, and, through us, with hell (Ar­ cana Coelestia §2046). He sends us beneficent spirits who counterbal­ ance the evil spirits. Thus, we find ourselves in a state of permanent equilibrium that enables us to maintain a free will (Heaven and Hell §293) God constantly keeps his finger on the index of the scale and moderates its oscillations without violation of free will, in exercising restraint upon it (True Christian Religion §504). As we see, this theory of free will is only an elaboration of the ideas of Swedenborg's Economy of the Animal Kingdom. Likewise, the entire thesis of the regeneration of humanity rests upon the notion of a struggle between the exterior and the inner person that we first saw posed in Economy of the Animal Kingdom and which has later played a leading role during the period of crisis of the Journal of Dreams. The evil tendency, which is transmitted from parents to chil­ dren, can only be neutralized by a new birth by the Lord (True Chris­ tian Religion §521). Each person must effect this rebirth \"as of himself' of his own free will, in constant combat with his own evil bents. The first step on this path consists of repentance (poenitentia). This repentance has nothing in common with the Lutheran contri­ tion, which only pays lip-service confession of sin, draws upon a per­ son's head the wrath of God, and merits damnation (True Christian Religion §§513-516). Repentance consists of the awareness of sin and the rigorous scrutiny not only of our deeds but also of the intention of the will, searching seriously to abolish all internal evil. For evil dwells in us insofar as we fail to discard it absolutely, and God does not re­ move the evil without our cooperation (True Christian Religion, 271"

The individual resembles a community in miniature; if, from the spiritual point of view, he does not act for himself, as a com­ munity does in the natural realm against criminals, he will be pun­ ished after death (True Christian Religion §531). Just as this repentance is a slow process, so is regeneration, for which it is the preparation, not instantaneous, but pursued during the whole life of man in order to continue and be completed after death (True Chris­ tian Religion §61O). Regeneration has to start within the inner person. We should first free ourselves from our individual \"proprium\" as well as the evil which is inherited from generation to generation and which we have aggravated by receiving into our hearts the love of self and the world that emanates from hell. If we persevere in this liberation, God cre­ ates for us a new \"heavenly\" proprium (Apocalypse Explained §585). This second birth consists of the fact that we first accept new truths through the intermediation of reason. We then learn to desire and act in accordance with them and put them into practice (True Christian Religion §589). Once this new creation of the reason and will has been realized in the inner person, and once he or she has acquired knowledge of the truth and comes to know it and love it for itself, a struggle arises between the inner and outer person, between the new and the former will. This struggle bears the name of spiritual temptation, and the person is only conscious of it as remorse. It is, nevertheless, a struggle between God and the devil, that is, hell, who contend for possession of the human being. But although this fight takes place in the spiri­ tual world, at the same time it develops in the very interior of each person, between the truths and the falsities which are found within him or her. This is because the individual is left to fight as though alone, free to act with the Lord or with the devil (True Christian Reli­ gion §596). There we find the same exposition already seen in The Worship and Love o/God. After having undergone this temptation, the inter­ nal person belongs to heaven and the external to the world. Associa­ tion between humanity and heaven is reestablished and God leads us according to heavenly order. From that moment, we are endowed with a new will and a new intelligence.

Here we rec­ ognize Swedenborg's old dream of a state in which the divine light can freely suffuse our soul and we are directly led by the anima. That is the level which he says he has attained himself as a result of the cri­ sis which he has passed through. Moreover, Swedenborg believes himself to be the only one of his contemporaries to have reached so high. He even says that, after the Council of Nicea, where \"the dogma of the three Gods was established,\" nobody had reached a state of inner regeneration to the level where he found himself in a state of \"spiritual temptation\" (True Christian Religion §597). Swedenborg, then, reaches a state of union of the soul with the Divinity that appears as the ultimate objective of all mysticism. But the path that leads to this differs notably from the one on which mys­ tics generally travel; it also differs from the path to which we saw him bound in the course of his great crisis. The focal point no longer resides in the unlimited renunciation of selfhood; it is no longer by prayer, ecstasy, and contemplation that one comes nearest to God. It is in submitting oneself to an active education that one is regenerated. It lies in sharpening the thought, in disciplining the will, in waging merciless war against all evil tendencies, and in transforming all this internal life into external action. And during this whole process of moral renewal, the person must more and more convince himself it is not he himself who acts, but God who acts within him. It is an error to believe that Adam, in a state of innocence, was equal to attaining wisdom and to loving God of himself and that he had lost this free will as a consequence of the Fall. It is precisely because Adam had wanted to have wisdom and love by his own power that he separated himself from wisdom and love and was cast out of the earthly para­ dise (Divine Love and Wisdom § 117). But the reconciliation of man with the Divinity cannot be effected exclusively by the feeling of our own powerlessness. Every union assumes reciprocity (reciprocitas), and this is why the human being has received the gift of thinking as of himself. He only achieves union with God from the moment when he makes full use of this gift, believing that he thinks and acts from God. That is the 273"

In my account, I have tried to throw light on some of the funda­ mental thoughts that dominate Sweden borg's theological system as well as their relation to preceding speculations. It is not appropriate to the limits of the present study to list here all of Swedenborg's het­ erodoxies with regard to Lutheran dogma. Nor would such an enu­ meration appear to offer much interest, Swedenborg himself having presented this systematically in his True Christian Religion. However, for the purpose of defining Swedenborg's doctrine historically, it does not appear to me useless to indicate his point of view regarding sev­ eral fundamental Protestant dogmas. On that subject, the most ra­ tional procedure seems to be to compare Swedenborg's conception with that of Dippel. As we have already seen, Swedenborg had early been influenced by Dippel's views, and the resemblance between the two doctrines became, during the theological period, so accentuated that it attracted the attention of a number of contemporaries. The analogies are particularly striking in that the critiques of Lutheranism by Swedenborg and Dippel have the same point of de­ parture. Both consider that Lutheranism gives too much importance to the orthodox dogma and excessively neglects the importance of the religious life. \"Ortopraxis gegen Ortodoxie\" (orthopraxy versus ortho­ doxy) is the battle cry of Dippel, and it is basically that of Sweden­ borg. But in this respect, both sustain only the aspirations of Pietism toward an ardent and more vital Christianity. What is more serious is that, in their eyes, the deficiency of Protestantism lies in the dogma of justification by faith alone. The re­ forms of Luther and Calvin had the purpose of depriving the pope and his subordinates of the traffic in indulgences. This only suc­ ceeded by effectively making Christ himself a trafficker in indul­ gences, remitting in advance the sins of humanity still captive of flesh and the devil. Such is the harsh criticism by Dippel of the Protestant doctrine of justification. 246 Although he stresses it less aggressively, Swedenborg basically shares Dippel's view. He maintains that, ac­ cording to the doctrine of sudden justification, many spirits carry from this world the conviction that they will obtain instant remission 274"

If Dippel and Swedenborg react so strongly against the doctrine of justification by faith, it is because they accord humanity a broader scope for free will than orthodox Lutheranism does. It naturally fol­ lows that they are obliged to deny the Lutheran doctrine of original sin. The sin of Adam has not at all taken away from us our free will in spiritual matters; we can cooperate in our regeneration. Sweden­ borg and Dippel both seem to admit that the evil created by the Fall does not consist of the fact that God has charged us with the sin of Adam. Rather it consists of the fact that, from the moment when hu­ manity turned from God, we transmitted to our descendants the ten­ dency to evil. \"Keine imputation, sondern eine reelle Jortgepjlantzte corruption,\" (No imputation, but a real, transmitted corruption) de­ clares Dippel;247 such also is Swedenborg's viewpoint, as was ex­ plained earlier in this chapter. With Dippel, as with Swedenborg, the doctrine of divine wrath's weighing on humanity disappears with the orthodox doctrine of justification by faith. Dippel does not find expressions harsh enough to stigmatize this \"pagan,\" \"barbarous\" conception, which portrays God, who is love, as full of anger against every mortal-a God, who, under the stress of this anger, abandons his creative plan in order to pronounce the reprobation of humankind. The difference between God's love and his wrath exists only in the sentiment of the human being. For the \"fury\" of God is only a form of his love, an ex­ pression of his ardor against sin, from which, quite like a physician, he intends to deliver us by bitter medicine. 248 Swedenborg protests with just as much energy against attribut­ ing to God qualities and behavior that would appear, even among men, to be the height of cruelty. In one of his memorabilia (True Christian Religion §134), a pastor in the spiritual world makes an ex­ position of the orthodox doctrine according to which God has, in his rage, cursed the human race and has been appeased only by the suf­ fering of his Son on the cross.

No good master could so deal with his manservants and maidservants, nor even a wild beast or a bird of prey with its young. It is horrible. By \"the wrath of God\" in the Scriptures, is meant the sin of man, which is the antithesis of God. God is never angered against man. As is well known, Dippel's negation of divine wrath leads him to the \"realist\" doctrine of redemption, which he structures progres­ sively and which he considered to be his essential contribution to the­ ology. According to the orthodox view, we are saved, not from sin, but from punishment of this sin, from the divine reprobation that threatened us. The role of Jesus Christ is not to regenerate the moral and religious life of humanity, but to give satisfaction, instead of and in the place of humankind, to God for the offense done to his glory. This doctrine is \"illusory,\" to Dippel's mind. To it, he opposes his own theory, according to which Jesus Christ, by his incarnation in the body of a sinner like Adam, by the suffering of the cross and by his resurrection, has broken forever the chains of sin, death, and the devil. The \"real\" redemption consists of the fact that Jesus, serving us as a model, has shown us the way and given us the means of truly tri­ umphing over sin.249 To adopt the Ritschl's formula for the views of Dippel-Christ, then, is the type of our own self-denial and sanctification. 25o Never­ theless, the significance of this doctrine of redemption is attenuated by Dippel's strongly established conception of the inner Christ, of the interior Word, a mystic conception he shares with several of his Pietist contemporaries. Basically, it is this interior Christ and not the historical Christ who is the true redeemer. It is no doubt an ines­ timable grace of God that Christians are not exclusively reduced to the inner Word, but that they may also have recourse to the incarnate Word, that is to say, Jesus Christ, to guide them in the right path.

The states through which \"the Lord\" passed during his incarnation accord with the immutable divine order, the order that likewise governs human­ ity. \"Every person progresses and must progress in accordance with this order, if from being natural he is to become spiritual. In like manner it was necessary for the Lord to progress, in order to make divine his natural human\" (True Christian Religion § 105). Evidently, this theme does not play a particularly important role in Sweden­ borg's theology and in reality only serves to show how fully God clothes himself in the human form and submits himself to the order which he himself provided for human development. Swedenborg energetically underscores the other side of Dippel's doctrine of redemption, that of Christ bursting the chains of sin and the devil. He delivers an ardent polemic against the orthodox doc­ trine according to which Jesus' suffering on the cross was in itself the redemption proper (True Christian Religion § 132). According to him, the redemption resides in the crushing of the hells and the ordering of the heavens. At the time of the first advent of the Lord, the hells had attained such a height that they occupied the totality of the world of spirits, the intermediate realm between heaven and hell, and in­ fested the two lower heavens as well. This reflected the fact that the whole earth had turned from God and that the Jewish church had become corrupt through the falsification and profanation of the Word. After their deaths, the people of this church overran the world of spirits, and, to oust them, it became necessary for the Lord to de­ scend to earth. He then redeemed not only humanity but angels also (True Christian Religion §121). As well as I can judge, there is no great analogy between Dip­ pel's doctrine of redemption and that of Swedenborg. They agree in that both categorically reject the orthodox doctrine of redemption and in that they notably restrict the role of the historic Christ. If it can 277"

When, in 1757, the Lord subjugates the hells again and reestablishes order in the heavens, he does not take on the human form again; he effects the work of redemption by commissioning Swedenborg to proclaim the spiritual sense of the divine Word. In sum, neither Dip­ pel nor Swedenborg accords the doctrine of redemption a fundamen­ tal significance, Swedenborg even less than Dippel, for he sees in the advent of Christ only a manifestation of God (although the most im­ portant one); for him, every universal church ends in a last judgment, followed by a subsequent redemption. It is evident that, with this conception of Christ, Dippel, like Sweden borg, cannot content himself with the orthodox doctrine of the Trinity. This appears to both as tainted by the same original error, the \"tritheism,\" as Dippel expresses it. And both seek to escape this difficulty in the same way, by considering the Trinity from a modalist point of view. In his defense of the Vera Demonstratio evan­ gelica, Dippel declares that he wanted to point out the well-informed view of ancient Greek Fathers of the Church, who considered the three persons of the Divinity as his three modi subsistendi, \"die allein in der Gottheit, und nicht in sich selbst, sowohl ihre subsistantz als Wesen haben.\"252 There is, nevertheless, room to note that this conception of the Trinity, which is rather close to that of Swedenborg, does not playa very considerable role with Dippel. He is basically the enemy of all subtle speculation on the Deity and feels that the decadence of Chris­ tianity dates from the day when the conception of the Trinity became mingled with \"philosophic chimeras.\" Being finite beings, we will never succeed in explaining the essence of the divine Being in terms of our own ideas, and God does not expect us to attain an ade­ quate knowledge of his Being.253 What is above all important, now as always, is that we become suffused by the interior Christ, who can save us, whatever be our concept of the Trinity. \"Der wahre Christ, der in Cristo seyn Heyl ken net und suchet und nur einiger Massen erfohren hat, was das Leben in Gott und ausser Gatt sey, wird dergleichen 278"

For him, only by a correct conception of the Trinity can one gain a right idea of God. Since each one of us will have our place in heaven according to the idea we have of God, the correct concep­ tion of the Trinity has a fundamental importance for our salvation (True Christian Religion §163). To Swedenborg's mind, the dogma of the Trinity, as it was fixed by the Council of Nicea, has led to the be­ lief in three gods and determined the decadence of the church. \"It has extinguished the light of the Word and excluded the Lord from the church.\" It has brought about the abomination of desolation pre­ dicted by Daniel and in the Apocalypse. And no flesh could have been had not God created new heavens and instituted a new church (True Christian Religion §§177-183). Whoever has received the divine light perceives that \"within the faith of the present Church, which in its internal form is a faith in three gods and in its external form a faith in one, there are swarms of falsities .... But how can any mind see it so long as the door to that faith and its offshoots is shut and bolted by the decree that it is unlawful for reason to look into myster­ ies?\" (True Christian Religion § 178). As we see, this is the reverse of Dippel's doctrine. And this difference between the two conceptions is fundamental. It would appear that Swedenborg, who considered himself as in contact with the super sensory world, should have been particularly prepared to accept Dippel's doctrine on the interior Word, a continu­ ous revelation that speaks in the heart of everyone who is capable of attaining regeneration, even without the help of the external word. Swedenborg, however, considers that such a direct revelation is im­ possible in the present state of humanity. It exists on other planets than ours, and humanity possessed it in the time of the first church but lost it through the Fall. What remains for us is an indirect revela­ tion through correspondences. And when, in turn, this modality of knowledge was lost, the Scripture was given to humankind, after which the ties that united us to God were broken, as a means of reestablishing union with the Creator. Humanity, then, is no longer capable of receiving direct revelation of divine verities; and if we did 279"

It is easy to conceive that Dippel and Swedenborg thus arrive at very different conceptions of the Bible. Dippel protests against the bibliolatry that dominates theology. He criticizes the doctrine of in­ spiration and thinks that this can only be applied to the practical dog­ mas of salvation. In effect, Scripture cannot be considered as the Word of God; it is only a witness of the inner and living Word of God, incarnated in Jesus Christ. God is as close to all Christians as he was to the prophets and the apostles. A true Christian has only to cre­ ate Scripture in his intercourse with God; he can write sacred texts himself.255 The Bible does not pretend to be a theological norm but is a practical rule of life.256 By contrast, Swedenborg's theology rests completely on the strictest dogma of inspiration. Divine wisdom conceals itself not merely in each phrase but in each word of Sacred Scripture. The inner sense of the Bible has been hidden from humankind since its origin, and only the special mission confided to Swedenborg has per­ mitted him to probe and proclaim it. As should be evident from the comparison I have just made be­ tween the two theologians, Dippel has exercised an incontestable in­ fluence on Swedenborg's theology, but he does not appear to me as in any way decisive for the elaboration of the latter's theological system. Nor do I believe it likely that Dippel played a preponderant role in Swedenborg's religious conversion. As a consequence of his aspira­ tions toward a more ethical Christianity, Swedenborg has been quite naturally led to attack the same orthodox Lutheran dogmas as Dippel has, and it is manifest that Dippel's audacious critique had a stimulat­ ing and fecund effect on the mind of Sweden borg. Yet the actual sim­ ilarities between the two doctrines are really very minor. This approach appears to me to find powerful confirmation in the Swedenborg's own estimations of Dippel in the Spiritual Diary. In sundry paragraphs, Sweden borg gives an account of his meetings with Dippel in the spiritual world and renders a certain homage to him for the acuity of his polemic, but Dippel's positive conceptions appear to Swedenborg to be absurd.

In the spiritual world, Dippel is tied so that he cannot use his powers of persuasion to corrupt his social circle, as he did by his mischievous writing while alive in the world: \"Jucundum vitae ejus fuit omnes refutare et turbas excitare\" (His joy in life was to refute everybody and to excite the crowds; Spiritual Diary §5995). Here, indeed, we see the haughty superiority of the aristocratic thinker toward the democratic proselytizer. We find again, moreover, this aversion against any form of religious agitation in the judgment that Swedenborg harbors on reformers. What seems to be the charac­ teristic of Luther is that he was a quibbler, talking unceasingly and allowing no one else to have the floor; his greatest quality was his gift of persuasion (persuasio), the force of which was such that no one could resist him and which became a kind of magical witchcraft by which he blinded the multitude (Spiritual Diary §5105; True Christian Religion § 796). Concerning Dippel, Swedenborg's estimation appears basically to the point. By nature and by temperament, Dippel is a practical preacher of repentance, a violently aggressive and utterly fanatical polemicist. He detests metaphysics and syllogisms and is little con­ cerned with ordering his ideas into a theological system. Most often he expounds his own dogmas as hypotheses and at times limits him­ self to defending them by purely practical arguments. Swedenborg, on the contrary, is essentially a theoretician, a con­ structor of systems. We have seen that, ever since his youth, he has sought to establish the great causal connections and that the mystical elements have penetrated little by little into his mind like so many new links of his system. His whole theology is basically a transposi­ tion of his natural philosophy in Economy of the Animal Kingdom. His method of presentation is still soberly scholastic, whether he deals with the theory of knowledge, the nature of God, or the spiritual world. A study of Swedenborg beginning, as is customary, with Lutheran dogmas and attempting to expose the divergences of the two doctrines in detail risks giving only a confused portrayal of Swedenborg's personality and views.

The pre­ ceding pages will have established, I believe, that Swedenborg's doc­ trinal system constitutes an attempt to coordinate logically a certain number of fundamental ideas, most of which go back to Sweden­ borg's scientific period and which were further developed during the course of his religious crisis. He consequently eliminates the orthodox dogmas that are incompatible with his own ideas. It can hardly have escaped the attentive reader that Sweden­ borg's fundamental ideas, carried to their extreme consequences, lead to irreducible antinomies in his philosophical system. His conception of the divine Being, his doctrine of a universe created out of the very substance of God but essentially distinct from him, his theory of the birth of sin or of humankind's free will are striking examples. But Swedenborg never attempts to conceal these antinomies from the reader. On the contrary, he himself often acknowledges his inability to resolve them; he declares that the most difficult enigmas are and remain indecipherable to every created intelligence and that the an­ gels themselves do not succeed in resolving them fully. On the other hand, when it is a matter of dogma concerning our salvation, he is extremely zealous in conceding nothing that appears to him as contradictory or psychologically unacceptable. Thus, he re­ jects the orthodox doctrine of the Trinity because it requires of its ad­ herents the visualization of something that cannot be clearly represented. We cannot and should not picture God otherwise than as the perfect man, such as he has appeared to us. The indefinable di­ vine Being of God is beyond our human intelligence. Swedenborg equally condemns the theory of creation from nothing because it ap­ pears to him to be manifestly inadmissible that anything could be cre­ ated from nothing. God is the only Being; consequently, creation can only issue from his substance. Sweden borg therefore does not pretend to present any article of faith that implies a contradiction in itself; his philosophy aspires to satisfy the demands of reason. \"The dogma established by the papists, and later picked up by the Protestants, according to which reason must be subordinated to faith in theological questions, has closed the 282"

If one sets aside the purely dogmatic points of the True Christian Religion, what results is a sort of sober moral catechism, which ex­ plains the insistence on Swedenborg's rationalism and even the doubts regarding his characterization as a mystic. I have already re­ sponded to these exaggerations by pointing out the striking parallels between the religious evolution of Swedenborg and that of the great mystics. I have likewise shown that many concepts that are customar­ ily considered as rationalistic are, in reality, derived from the mystic needs of his mind. Such a purely rationalistic and practical view of Swedenborg would be justified if one contented oneself with observ­ ing that neither True Christian Religion nor the other dogmatic works dating from his theological period serve as or are intended to serve as manuals of mystic religiosity of the type of certain works of German mysticism or of Spanish Quietism. Even a superficial comparison with, for example, the works of Mme. Guyon, then much read and admired in Sweden, suffices to illustrate the difference. Dippel him­ self, in this respect, is a much more characteristic mystic than Sweden borg. It is evident that Sweden borg's teachings cannot be ranked among the Pietist mysticism of his century, nor can they be consid­ ered purely and simply a result of a philosophical opposition to Cartesianism and the rationalism of Leibniz and Wolff, who played such a great role in the genesis of Economy of the Animal Kingdom. During his theological period, moreover, Sweden borg was exposed to the clear influence of Dippel and Malebranche. But the essential part of his system is not at all covered by their doctrines, and we search in vain in the rich gallery offered by that era of sect-founding dreamers, of mystics on the prowl for philosophical speculations, for any figure presenting some similarity with that of Swedenborg. In reality, it is necessary to go back to the Renaissance to find a comparable measure of his personality. 283"

He calls attention to the fact that the qualities he has inherited from its leaders-universal interest and constructive imagination-have stamped their imprint on his theosophical doctrine as well. With the help of our preceding observations, we can now complete the parallel and identify the close bonds between Swedenborg and the Kabbalistic nature philosophy of the Renaissance. We have already seen that the parts of his system that are mani­ festly based on foreign models can be related to the Platonism of the Renaissance. Several of his doctrines present in detail striking analo­ gies with the works of Pico della Mirandola, although we cannot prove materially that Swedenborg was aware of them. We are unfor­ tunately faced with the more or less impossibility of establishing by which route the doctrines of the Kabbalistic philosophy have reached him. I have nevertheless pointed out the existence of these doctrines in certain medical works consulted by Swedenborg. It does not ap­ pear rash to suppose the importance of a Swedish tradition, associat­ ing it with Stiernhielm, the most illustrious adept of these doctrines in Sweden. The fact that an edition of Plotinus annotated by Stiern­ hielm was found in Sweden borg's library already makes this hypoth­ esis plausible. On the other hand, it is also possible that Swedenborg could have known of the speculations of Stiernhielm through Ben­ zelius who, at the time of their closest intimacy, happened to be about to write a study of the Swedish poet. However that may have been, we are here reduced to hypotheses impossible to verify. Nonetheless, the analogies between Swedenborg and Pico della Mirandola are striking. 258 They were raised in somewhat similar in­ tellectual environments, and there was an undeniable intellectual kinship between them. Both were born in eras when the researches based on experimentation and exact methods were beginning to un­ dermine the authority of faith, on which the preceding generations had uniformly built their philosophy. Both considered themselves as heralds of the new ideas. Pico della Mirandola combats astrology and divination with the same energy that Swedenborg, in his works on 284"

This past binds them, on the contrary, in a fashion so much the more closely that they seek to free themselves from it and that they throw themselves all the more obstinately into meditation on the last problems that remain unresolved. When one reviews the biography of Pico della Mirandola, one gets the clear impression that--even had he not met with Savonarola-his path would have brought him irresistibly back to the medieval church, to the cloister, just as one is convinced that the conversion of Swedenborg would have been ineluctably produced one day or another, even if he had not received the external impulsion of the Pietism that prevailed in Sweden around 1730. Neither one nor the other definitively escaped what Swedenborg calls in True Christian Religion §653 \"the current in the ocean which unobservedly draws the vessel.\" Their philosophies are only attempts to cover this dualism, and this is the reason they do not at any moment become either an inti­ mate mysticism or a rational and transparent logic. Rationalism and mysticism, antiquity and Christianity pursue a relentless struggle within the vast construction of their doctrines. They hope to resolve all the antinomies by the Neoplatonic doctrine of a transcendent unity above the sphere of thought, by the divine light that penetrates everything. In reality, everything is one; the dispersion of multiplicity exists only in the human mind. All is spiritual, endowed with a soul, divine in the measure that all is alive by the grace of God; the entire universe is only a symbol of a higher world, where every terrestrial thing has its celestial equivalent. This reasoning is confirmed for them by the Kabbalah and assures them in their conception that all human knowledge has a unique source, the Holy Scripture, through which Pythagoras, Plato, and Aristotle, by unknown ways, were dis­ ciples of Moses. And it is thus that they find their fundamental theses in their allegorical exegesis of the Bible, notably those according to which all things find their norm in humankind, from the fact that the Eternal has the human form and that the universe in its entirety con­ stitutes the homo maxim us. 285"

I could not better illustrate this concordance than by citing Pi co della Mirandola's fa­ mous passage in his Oratio de hominis dignitate, which is always in­ voked as an example of the high idea the Renaissance had of humankind: All other beings in nature are subject to our laws,\" said the Cre­ ator to Adam. \"Only thou knowest no limit and by the opera­ tion of thy free will to which I, myself, have entrusted thee, thou thyself shalt write thine own laws .... We have created thee ei­ ther mortal or immortal, in order that thou thyself canst, by thine own wish and for thine own glory, be thine own creator and sculptor and give thee the form which thou desirest. Thou canst, according to the good pleasure of thy soul, either abase thyself to bestiality, or regenerate thyself for the highest good, for divinity .... Animals possess from birth and carry with them in the womb of their mother all that which they later enjoy. Su­ perior minds are, from the beginning, or at least immediately after the creation, what they are to be to eternity. It is with man, and only with man, that the Creator has deposited the seed of all things, the possibility of all forms of life.\"259 It is hardly necessary to point out how completely this concep­ tion accords with that of Swedenborg. In Economy of the Animal Kingdom and The Worship and Love of God, he has already shown that the faculty for self-development is the distinctive sign of humankind. It is the reason he maintains with so much obstinacy his theory of human free will and refuses to admit the existence of innate ideas. Heavenly beings are born with all their intelligence; animals are led by their instincts and attain from birth their full development. Only the human being is born without any knowledge and without well­ marked instincts, but is endowed with a faculty of self-development towards good and evil which no other creature possesses. So it is for humanity that creation took place.

We are the sole species through whom the Creator might reunite with the universe that emanates from him. With this conception, of the dignity of humankind and of our unlimited possibility of progress, inherited from antiquity and from the Renaissance, Swedenborg must react strongly against contempo­ rary doctrines derived from Locke's doctrine of the state of the newly born human soul as a tabula rasa. By this view, there is only a differ­ ence of degree between the intellectual and spiritual faculties of the human and those of the animal, and that, as in animals, it is ulti­ mately the instinct of self-interest and survival that is the propelling force in humankind. It is beyond doubt that Sweden borg was not ignorant of the doctrines of the Encyclopedists, whether he had come to know their English precursors during his youth or whether he was able to gather an idea of their teachings from the numerous extracts in the periodi­ cals. However that may be, we find allusions to their principal theses in diverse passages of his later work. Thus, in Heaven and Hell §555, we read a violent polemic against Helvetius' doctrine that selfishness is the source of all human action. In the world, says Swedenborg, we imagine that egoism (amor SUt) is the flame of life and that man en­ feebles himself if he does not allow himself to be led by it. \"It is said: 'Who, then, has accomplished whatever may be praiseworthy, useful, or memorable for any other purpose than to gain honor and glory in the eyes of others, and whence comes this desire if not from the ardor of our love of the glory and honors, that is to say, from our self­ hood?'\" This is evidently the reasoning of Helvetius himself. Con­ trary to this thesis, Swedenborg argues that egoism, the love of self, is the love that rules in hell and makes hell in the heart of man. It was therefore entirely in the spirit of their teacher when, in the Pro Sensu Communi polemic in the late 1780s, the Swedish Swedenborgians above all turned against Johan Henric Kellgren's proclamation of conceit as the vehicle of all human progress. In another passage (True Christian Religion §692), Swedenborg underscores the contrast between the high idea formed of human 287"

It is in an \"Olympian\" school of the Athenaeum that the ancient sages, Pythagoras, Socrates, Aristippus, and Xenophon gather with their disciples to learn the modifications and progress of wisdom from spirits newly arriving from this world. The day Swedenborg is present he is asked the customary question: \"What is the latest news from earth?\" And the newcomers announce, \"that a man who resem­ bled an animal and animals who resemble man had been found in the forests.\" It is finally agreed that these are human creatures who have been lost in the second or third year of their lives and who have lived in the forests without having been taught to speak by anyone. Unlike animals, they are not even capable of distinguishing useful nourish­ ment but have been nourished by all that they had found in the woods, pure or impure. From this, it is deduced that on earth humans are by nature less intelligent and more despicable than animals and that only the fac­ ulty of emitting articulate sounds has allowed the human species to develop. If the animals had the gift of speech, they would reason with as much rigor as humans on no matter what topic. Thus, it is consid­ ered vain to believe that a human being should have more reason to live after death than an animal; religion that preaches immortality is only an artifice for governing the interior lives of the simple, as the laws of the government rules their external lives. Obviously, this episode is a reproduction, only slightly exaggerated, of the favorite doctrines of the Encyclopedists. On hearing these words, the sages of antiquity exclaim: \"Oh, what times now prevail on earth! Alas! What changes wisdom has undergone! Has it then changed into insensate rhetoric? The sun has gone down and is found on the other side of the earth at the antipode of its zenith.\" And they maintain later on that the discovery of the man in the forests justly proves that humankind, born in a state of in­ nocence more complete than that of an animal, and only develops through education. The human being is only a form receiving life from God and is able to become regenerate by an eternal union with God.

It is interesting to note that, even in this circumstance, Sweden­ borg remains faithful to the conception he has learned from Locke: that only instruction elevates humans above the animals. He in no way opposes the thesis according to which a human being, having grown up entirely isolated in the forests, would be condemned to re­ main on a level inferior to that of an animal. But to Swedenborg's mind, this only offers further proof that the human being has been created to attain perfection and to reunite with the Creator.

While the former has often been considered as reason­ able, sometimes even too rational and dispassionate, his speculations on the spiritual world have more often been regarded as fantastic and incoherent fancies, the products of an unhealthy mind. I believe I have already made it clear that I do not share this opinion at all. Just as the mystical element in the theological doctrine of Swedenborg has generally been overlooked, sufficient attention has not been paid to the rationalistic elements of his eschatology or to the logical relationship between these and the rest of his theology. There has been an attraction, in a far too one-sided fashion, toward certain grotesque or picturesque details of his descriptions of the fu­ ture life as well as to some of his spectacular visions and conversations with spirits; but in general, no clear idea of the structure of his escha­ tological system has been formed. Naturally, I cannot give a complete exposition of this system here. My task will be to show that the fun­ damental ideas that dominate Swedenborg's views are found again in this system and how his dreams of the spiritual world are the expres­ sion of his ideals. The distinctive characteristic of Swedenborg's spiritual world is, as we know, that it is peopled exclusively by human beings.

In The Worship and Love of God, we find an­ gels created along with human beings; the fall of the devil has pre­ ceded and contributed to that of Adam and Eve. It is only in Sweden borg's theological system that the human being becomes the focus of the entire creation. This initial principle explains the systematic analogy that exists between the spiritual and terrestrial worlds. In his earthly life, the human being is, in effect, internally either an angel or a devil, and the vicissitudes of natural life only serve to prepare him for the future spiritual life. The theory of correspondences teaches us, moreover, that every earthly thing possesses a higher correspondence, and the doctrine of humanity as the norm of creation allows us to find the human form again in the greater as well as in the lesser things of the spiritual world. The three realms of the spiritual world-heaven, the world of spirits, and hell-consequently correspond to the three \"parts\" of the human being; and each of these, in turn, is divided into three king­ doms. It does not appear to me of great interest here to dwell any longer on these subdivisions, which are based on the three divisions of the human into anima, mens, and corpus and their subdivisions. We recall that each of these parts is subdivided, in turn, into halves: the anima offers a compartment for heavenly warmth-good-and an­ other for the celestial light-truth. These two correspond, in the mens, to the will and the understanding, and in the body, to the heart and lungs. This compartmentalization produces a new horizontal division of the spiritual world. The three heavens are divided into a celestial and a spiritual realm, populated respectively by celestial and spiritual angels. And we can follow similar subdivisions into hell, where they correspond to genii and spirits. As we shall see, the doctrine of mar­ riage in the spiritual world rests on this difference between the will and the understanding.

Alongside this view, based on the doctrine of correspondences of the spiritual realms in human form, Swedenborg still makes a no­ tably more concrete representation of the spiritual world-a concep­ tion that, in broad outline, agrees with the traditional view of most visionaries. The world of spirits, the intermediate realm between heaven and hell, appears to its inhabitants like a valley surrounded by crags and mountains. A narrow way leads to the celestial kingdoms situated above the valley; seen from the world of spirits, these king­ doms looks like clouds or brilliant white mists (Heaven and Hell §583). Crevices among the crags and hills lead to the hells, which are situated in the depths of the earth below the world of spirits. They have the form of black gulfs and grottos, at times resembling bogs and sheets of water. When one of them is opened, which only occurs when an inhabitant of the world of spirits is cast down there, flames and sooty smoke are emitted as from a flaming furnace (Heaven and Hell §585). Nauseating odors and pestilential vapors issue from these fissures, and one hears horrible cries rise from the abyss at the same time (Heaven and Hell §429).260 From this we may conclude that, to a certain extent, space and time exist in the spiritual world. Only the Divinity is free from space and time. No doubt our fixed spatial and temporal conditions are not found again in the spiritual world; but given the fact that angels and spirits see through their eyes exactly as humans do and that objects can only be seen in space, spaces apparently exist in the spiritual world. Likewise, all the events in the spiritual world, as well as in our own world, take place in apparent time. However, angels and spirits have no idea of time or space, for the changes in time or space for them are only modification of states. Everything the angels think is immediately present to them as real. When a spirit seeks the presence of another spirit, he immediately sees him or her appear before his eyes. Everything the angels see around them are correspondences of their own interior. This is how gardens and paradises, blooming with all kinds of flowers, appear to angels in a state of wisdom, among 292"

As a kind of analogy to the conditions of time and space prevail­ ing in the spiritual world, Swedenborg points out that, for human thought, space does not exist, \"for the things which it intensively evokes appear to him to be present.\" When anyone goes from one place to another, the distance seems different according to whether he or she is in a hurry to arrive or not. \"The road itself is lengthened or shortened according to the desire of the traveler, although in reality it remains the same. That is an observation I have often made, to my great astonishment\" (Heaven and Hell §§195-196). From this, Swedenborg evidently understands that the condi­ tions of space and time prevailing in the spiritual world are subjective and are modified according to the internal state of the observer; for celestial things do not at all exist in the same way as terrestrial things. In heaven, they exist from the Lord according to their correspon­ dences with the inner life of the angels. They are, therefore, represen­ tations of the feelings and thoughts of the angels. From the fact that they constantly change with their feelings and thoughts, these receive the name of appearances (apparentiae; Heaven and Hell §§173-175). This does not prevent these appearances from having a real though still immaterial existence. All things existing in the natural world exist in the spiritual world in a more perfect form. They are substan­ tial, although not material. In various passages throughout his works, Swedenborg seeks to define more precisely what he means by \"substantial.\" It is the origin of matter; it is simple, while matter is the composite. To a spirit who asks him if, in these conditions, the difference between the spiritual and the natural is not a simple question of degree, Swedenborg replies: Such is not the distinction. By no sort of refinement can the nat­ ural so approximate the spiritual as to become the spiritual; for the distinction is like that between the prior and the posterior, between which there is no finite ratio. For the prior is in the pos­ terior as a cause in its effect; and the posterior is from the prior 293"

(True Christian Religion §280[2]) Here we again find the old conceptions of the scientific period regarding the existence of a kind of intelligible matter which is the origin of \"natural\" matter. Our material body is only the envelope of the substantial body, which also has a human form and persists after death. \"The anima of everyone resides in a spiritual body after having rejected the material envelope which it had borne in the world\" (Di­ vine Love and Wisdom §14). His reasoning rests, as we see, on the spa­ tiality of the soul, a concept we can follow back to the time of the Principia. It follows that, by their form, the angels have all the char­ acteristics of humans; they have a face, ears, hands, feet, etc.; they see each other and converse together, \"in a word, nothing of the attrib­ utes of man is lacking, except that they are not clothed in a material body\" (Heaven and Hell §7S). They also wear clothes, except for the angels of the inmost heaven, who are nude. The splendor of their clothing corresponds to the degree of their understanding. And they find themselves in conditions of time and space similar to ours, with the difference that these conditions vary according to their inner state. Thanks to this theory, the heaven of Swedenborg can borrow its colors from earthly dreams of happiness. The only difference lies in the fact that all objects are only appearances; they constitute a projec­ tion of the thoughts and feelings of the angels. Swedenborg likewise describes the life of the world of spirits and of hell. Here also the inhabitants wander about in an environ­ ment that reproduces their own imaginary world in perceivable form. The doctrine of correspondences thus permits Swedenborg to endow his spiritual world with an infinity of external details. His ex­ position becomes a vast universal panorama. Their proportions and reciprocal relationships are often the object of a fantastic inversion, and the doctrine of correspondences frequently removes every im­ pression of reality from these portrayals. It is easy, however, to dis­ cover the originals. 294"

The majority of humans come into the world of spirits directly from earthly life and consequently retain all their individual characteristics. They have the same face, the same voice, the same habits they had during their terrestrial life, even the same desires, thoughts, and interests, although of a more ex­ quisite essence. \"It follows that once having become a spirit, the man only knows what he knew when he was in the body he occupied in the world, and does not know that he is dead\" (Heaven and Hell §461). Spirits continue to be near their relatives and friends. They en­ gage in the same professions as on earth; they even continue to be dis­ tributed according to religions and nationalities. They inhabit countries and cities corresponding exactly with those they inhabited when living on earth. Consequently, there exist in the world of spirits two cities analogous to London, where the majority of Englishmen gather after death. Sweden borg gives us precise details of their topog­ raphy. The Royal Exchange is located at the center of one of them, and the moderator and his staff reside there. The principal street is Holborn. To the west, as far as Wapping, live those who feel a con­ fused love of good. The best spirits reside in the eastern quarters, which extend well beyond the city. The intelligent spirits live to the south, as far as Islington. On the other hand, in Moorfields and its surroundings, the population is mixed. In effect, here is where all those who incline toward evil are relegated, and the city is thereby purged of its bad elements. The houses, dress, and nourishment of the Londoners are exactly like what they were during their earthly life. \"I asked about wine, strong drink, beer, chocolate, tea and the like, and was told that they had similar things. I also asked about the liquor called punch; they said that they also have the liquor, but it is given only to those who are sincere and at the same time industrious\" (Last Judgment [Posthumous) §269).261 In the world of spirits, the Jews inhabit a city called \"The Sordid Jerusalem,\" where they circulate in streets filled with filth to the an­ kles and where one is afflicted by nauseating smells.

The reason for this special­ ization is that precious stones correspond to the literal sense of the Word, which they are capable of understanding from the fact that they can read the Word in its original language. The situation pro­ vided for them in the world of spirits is so similar to that of their ter­ restrial life, that, less than any other people, they perceive that they have left this life (Last Judgment [Posthumous] §§251-261). The Swedes are the worst European inhabitants of the world of spirits, after the Italians and the Russians. The best among them in­ habit a city that resembles Gothenburg (it is well-known that Swedenborg had his first disciples in this city) and live in houses re­ sembling those they occupied during their lifetime. The wicked are grouped in a large agglomeration of towns which, besides Stock­ holm, include Falun to the east, Boras to the north, etc. From the time of the absolute monarchy, fear of the king maintained a certain order among the Swedes and their gravest faults, their spirit of dom­ ination and their ambition, could not be given free rein. At the pres­ ent time, they give free play to their dominating spirit and-due to the fact that they do not possess riches like other peoples-to their greed for gain. The majority among them seek public employment and titles; and, in the world of spirits, they give themselves to perni­ cious artifices (Spiritual Diary §5034ff., §5462). Members of the Swedish nobility are particularly haughty, egotistical, and ambitious. When they hold their assemblies of the nobility in the world of spir­ its, the angels observe that they are incapable of speaking from their inner being or distinguishing good from evil and judge everything according to their personal convenience. They are, consequently, pro­ gressively removed from their offices and finally reduced to beggary (Spiritual Diary §5461). For Swedenborg, the world of spirits is the rallying area for most of the dead. Few indeed are those who are sufficiently regener­ ated to be accepted directly into heaven immediately after death or sufficiently degenerate to be precipitated directly into hell. During the earthly life of most people, there has been a discordance between the inner and the outer self, between the will and the understanding, which has to be overcome before they find their true place in the spir­ itual world. This is exactly what takes place in the world of spirits. 296"

Both are progressively modified, and the person has in the end a face and voice that correspond to his inner being, that is to say, his ruling love (amor regnans). Thus, the person becomes incapable of simulating sentiments other than those he truly feels. He finds him­ self constrained to speak as he thinks, and thenceforth his appearance reflects the real states of his soul (Heaven and Hell §457). Thanks to this transformation, the person reveals his true character, not only to other spirits, but also to his own mind. All the sins he has committed on earth, even those he has forgotten, reappear in his memory and are revealed to the angels assigned to scrutinize him. For each person possesses an interior memory on which are inscribed all he has thought, desired, said, done, understood, and seen; this memory sur­ vives his demise (Heaven and Hell §463). I have already mentioned Swedenborg's theory of an interior memory, in which the person pre­ serves recollections never gathered by his external memory. During terrestrial life, no one is aware of possessing this memory. It is exclusively the ruling love, then, that determines a person's lot in the other world. \"It is man's ruling love that continues after death and this is in no way changed to eternity\" (Heaven and Hell §477). For it is the person's will that, properly speaking, constitutes his being. \"Man as a whole is such as he is in his will and conse­ quently in his thought, so that an evil man is his own evil and a good man his own good\" (Heaven and Hell §463). This conviction of the supremacy of the will dominates Swedenborg's whole eschatology. It follows that no definitive reform is possible after death. In the world of spirits, the just receive instruction that prepares them for the life of heaven. And those who \"are hardened in deceit\" even while leading a good life, are submitted to a kind of purgatory in a place called \"the lower earth\" (Heaven and Hell §513).262 But those whose ruling love is turned to evil are susceptible to neither instruction nor reform. When they have found their true identity, they pass directly into infernal communes that are founded in the same love (Heaven and Hell §512). In this conception, we find again two of the fundamental theses of Swedenborg's theology: there is no justification by faith alone and 297"

Each person creates himself through the play of his free will and through the love by which he chooses to rule his life. It is the doctrine of Economy of the Animal Kingdom and The Worship and Love of God that reappears here in full. If an individual has chosen love of the world, he can only be reformed by a radical transformation and a regeneration. And regeneration cannot operate immediately any more than a tree can grow in one day (True Chris­ tian Religion §586). God himself can do no more by mercy; nor can he grant the grace of salvation in violation of the laws of divine order. \"The angels say that it would be easier to change a night-owl into a dove or a screech-owl into a bird of paradise than an infernal spirit into a heavenly spirit\" (Heaven and Hell §527) Consequently, in agreement with the Gospel of John, which he frequently quotes in this context, Swedenborg maintains that the evil pronounce their own damnation. They could not be happy among the just, whose joys they do not understand, and they are incapable of comprehending heavenly truths. The Lord excludes no one from the kingdom of heaven. Those who, at the moment of death, invoke the Lord in the belief that he can save them by immediate grace are ad­ mitted after death to the lower threshold of heaven. But when they enter there and the light of heaven flows over them, they are seized by vertigo. Their sight becomes dim, their thought is suspended, their heart throbs with unspeakable anguish, and they writhe like serpents near a flame; they throw themselves into the abyss yawning at their feet, and it is only from the moment they rejoin their like in hell that they recover their breath (Heaven and Hell §525; True Chris­ tian Religion §622).263 God, then, does not cast down any human being into hell. The person who lives in evil has no other desire than to enter the place where his evil is at home (Heaven and Hell §547). It follows that evil spirits are in their own environment in hell. They enjoy the fire of hell, its stench and its filth, and when a ray of divine light penetrates to them they seek to flee from it, preferring the infernal light, which is similar to that of smoldering coals and burning sulfur. Their faces are black and hairy and covered with pus­ tules, ulcers, and scars; but they believe among themselves to have human form (Heaven and Hell §553). They give themselves to the pleasures corresponding to their desires. In the less rigorous hells, 298"

From their dwellings, a noise of quarrels issues continu­ ously, and the streets are arenas of brawls and brigandage. Other in­ fernal spirits live in sordid houses of debauchery, while yet others wander like ferocious beasts in the obscurity of the forests (Heaven and Hell §586). They find their greatest pleasure in tormenting and torturing one another. They experience anguish only when angels from heaven intervene to restrain their violence, for they then feel de­ prived of their customary entertainment. The purpose of this chas­ tening is not at all to reform them-that would be a vain endeavor-but to restrain them through fear. This is the only means of influencing them, for without fear of punishment hell would col­ lapse like an earthly society deprived oflaws (Heaven and Hell §581). Under these conditions, infernal spirits only punish themselves through the insatiability of their desires. The same personal note is found in Swedenborg's conception of heavenly beatitude; it does not consist in perpetual enjoyment, for all pleasure, even of superior quality, induces dissatisfaction after a while. In the beautiful introductory chapter of Conjugial Love, Swedenborg relates that, in the world of spirits, an angel had gath­ ered together the wise men of all Christian nations to learn what idea they had formed of heavenly bliss. He found that, despite individual divergences, they all agreed that it consisted in uninterrupted enjoy­ ment. But the angel introduced them into spiritual \"societies\" where their notion of beatitude had been put into practice in order to con­ vince them that, after a short stay, the inhabitants of these societies became weary of entertainments and sought to move out of them. And this does not only apply to those who imagine heavenly bliss as a series of uninterrupted joys of paradise by way of strolls among rose gardens to the music of harps, but also to those who imagine this beatitude as a perpetual Sabbath, an incessant glorifica­ tion of God and the permanent elevation of hearts toward the Lord. They find the spirits sitting in their temples, no longer listening to the preaching, which has dulled their hearing and wearied their minds, overcome by the interminable ecstasy and finally hurried to the doors to escape this chamber of torture.

In another of Swedenborg's memorabilia, three newly arrived spirits express surprise that there exists in the heavens employments, professions, commercial operations, and marvelous crafts. They had believed that, being transported from the natural world into heaven, they would rest from labor forever. But one of the ancients asks them, \"Have you understood rest from all labor as perpetual idleness, where you would pass your time seated on couches inhaling pleasures into your lungs and drinking joys through your mouth?\" As the newcomers respond affirmatively, the ancient one assures them that idleness engenders weariness and lethargy and so is incompatible with all true enjoyment. It is the vigor of the mind (intensio animi) that maintains the elasticity of the body, and this vigor can be had from activity and labor. Thus, appointments and offices exist in heaven and tribunals of greater or lesser importance, as well as arts and crafts. The newcomers are then introduced into a library that is subdi­ vided into sections according to the different fields of knowledge, and they are stupefied by the number of volumes, parchments, pa­ pers, quills, and ink heaven contains. From there, they are escorted to museums, schools, and colleges, where intellectual activities and com­ petitions take place. They are eventually brought into the presence of administrators and functionaries of the city who show them the mar­ velous works executed in spiritual form by artists. And when they are at last convinced that eternal repose is not idleness, maidens appear, who make them gifts of articles that they have embroidered and woven with their own hands and sing a song whose heavenly melody expresses the inclination to useful labors and pleasure in accomplish­ ment (Conjugial Love §207). It follows that each angel of heaven has his task to accomplish, and his devotion is expressed by the good he does (Heaven and Hell §387). There exist in heaven all kinds of tasks: religious, administra­ tive, domestic. Certain angels have the mission of educating the chil­ dren who enter into heaven; others are assigned to the world of spirits to protect newcomers from attacks by malevolent spirits; oth­ ers to ensure order in hell (Heaven and Hell §391-393).

Thus, each has his task to perform, but he does not dedicate himself to it without recreation, since this, too, would weary him. In the heavens, there are also days of repose; feast days, when worship takes place; and special solemnities dedicated to concerts in public squares and, on the outskirts of cities, to games and spectacles. Musi­ cians are seated on three levels garlanded with vines, with their wind and string instruments, flanked by male and female singers, who en­ tertain the audience with the most beautiful chants (Conjugial Love §17). Even during work days, employment is intermixed with dis­ tractions, physical exercises, and artistic occupations. Every morning the soft chants of virgins and young women are heard floating on the air throughout the town from houses surrounding the public squares. When these songs come to an end, all doors and windows are closed, and the town becomes silent. No idlers are found; each one is busy at his or her tasks. Towards midday, doors open everywhere, windows also at times, and one sees girls and boys at play in the streets under the supervision of their teachers who are seated in colonnades of their dwellings. On the outskirts of the towns, girls and boys engage in varied activities, running, javelin-throwing, ball games. There are also organized competitions among boys to show who is the most alert in understanding, acting, or speaking. The winners are awarded laurel leaves. In the suburbs, theatrical pieces are also presented, where most of the actors represent the virtue of moral life. Jesters also figure among them on occasion (Conjugial Love §17). The most uncommon part of Swedenborg's eschatology, as we know, is his conception of marriage in the spiritual world. It is com­ paratively late that his view takes the clearly dogmatic form in which we find it in his Conjugial Love (published in Amsterdam in 1768).

As I have previously pointed out, Sweden borg had already pro­ pounded the thesis of a conjugal union in the future life in his De Anima § 1 02, which dates from 1741, although this detail appears to have escaped the commentators. In this work, he first deals with \"amor venereus\" or sexual love (§93ff.), which he analyzes with the same physiological minuteness that we later find in Conjugial Love. When this carnal love emanates exclusively from the animus, it con­ stitutes a drive that has only physical pleasure in mind. When, on the contrary, it originates in the anima, it acquires a noble and elevated purpose. In the following passage, he discusses the \"odium et adversa­ tio veneris\" (hatred and opposition to love). He rises with alacrity against the disfavor shown to carnal love as a result of egoism, an­ tipathy toward humanity, or senile insensibility to beauty. On the other hand, he says, we cannot censure those who condemn carnal love on principle as impure and forbidden. They possess the highest virtue, which is chastity. These distinctions conform perfectly with the Lutheran views of the day. More peculiar are the two subsequent chapters on amor conju­ gialis (conjugial love) and odium conjugiale (conjugial hate). Here Swedenborg declares that love truly conjugial is not only a bodily union but also one of minds (conjunctio mentium). And when the two partners aspire towards a spiritual end, they likewise bring about the union of their anima. The result is a heavenly life on earth; and, since this conjunction of souls persists after carnal pleasure has ceased, one is warranted in believing that the two souls (animae) remain united in heaven. \"But a marriage and a love of this nature does not develop as an effect of pure chance. They are the work of a particular interven­ tion of divine providence\" (De Anima §96). In this declaration, we may look for an echo of this hope, mani­ fested by Christian partners in all ages, that they be granted the en­ joyment of the heavenly blessing together. With his characteristic taste for symmetry, Swedenborg has nevertheless, in the following chapter, sought to invent an analogous retribution for spouses who have lived in discord during their sojourn on earth. When physical pleasure ceases for them, there only remains a murderous and 302"

These dissensions (disjugia) and infernal conflicts of souls also seem to arise, not by pure chance but by a duly motivated decision of divine provi­ dence.\" In closing, Sweden borg declares that of the two extremes which constitute conjugal love and conjugal hate, one can deduce the nature of the innumerable intermediary forms of unions that fill the universe (De Anima §97). It was certainly Sweden borg's intention to develop this theme in The Worship and Love of God. In the parts of this work that were written, he only speaks of the marriage of the first human couple in passing, but he does so in terms that clearly indicate that, here too, he considers marriage as of divine foundation and as constituting a union of souls. It is also observed that Swedenborg systematically re­ curs to marriage as symbolic of cosmic unions: union of earth and sky, of life and nature brought about in the nuptial chamber of heaven, to witness there the consecration of this union in the light of the nuptial torch, which is love. In the first part of the Adversaria, marriage equally has its heavenly correspondence and its exalted spiritual origin in the form of the divine union of truth and good, of the Messiah and the Church. When Sweden borg, in his theological system, transforms the human into angel after death, he quite naturally picks up his notion of celestial marriage again. This idea is also found frequently among the Church Fathers, scholars, and Protestant theologians, who recog­ nized angels as physical beings and even went so far as to consider them as possessing gender. We have likewise seen that it was per­ fectly possible, while Swedenborg was writing The Worship and Love of God, that he should have found this idea in Milton. This Miltonic influence seems also to emphasize the fact that, when he addresses the question of the origin and celestial correspondence of married union (Arcana Coelestia §§2727-27S9), Swedenborg attributes to heavenly marriage the same ethereal character as Milton does. It is not at all a matter of true conjugial relations in heaven. Those who during their terrestrial life have lived in conjugiallove are allowed to live together once they have become angels; sometimes they even 303"

There exists a union among them, not of bodies, but of souls (unio mentium; Arcana Coelestia §2732). Sweden borg does not push the audacity of his thought to the point of affirming, as he had done in De Anima, that spouses who have lived in discord will continue to cohabit in mutual torment in hell. Here he limits himself to declaring that spouses who have not lived in a true conjugial union will be separated after death. No lewdness exists in hell. The tendency toward lewdness gives way to a depraved pleasure in filth and excrements. Here Swedenborg develops more broadly the doctrine accord­ ing to which earthly marriage issues from heavenly marriage, the union of good and truth in God. With this good and this truth, con­ jugiallove is radiant in the world, but it changes character according to the nature of the subjects, as solar light is modified by the object it shines upon. This is of the sort that celestial beatitude can change into infernal voluptuousness (Arcana Coelestia §2741). It is clear that Swedenborg has already incorporated conjugiallove into his emana­ tionistic system. In Heaven and Hell, which dates from around 1757, Sweden­ borg still considers heavenly marriage as a purely spiritual union: Marriages in heaven are not like marriages on earth. In heaven marryings are spiritual, and cannot properly be called marryings (nuptiae), but conjunction of minds from the conjunction of good and truth. But on earth there are marryings, because these are not of the spirit alone but also of the flesh. (Heaven and Hell §382[b]) It follows that two spouses do not carry the titles of husband and wife into the heavens. It is easy to understand why Swedenborg does not admit any marriage in the heavens. In the same passage, he recalls the words of Luke 20:35: \"But those who are accounted worthy to attain to that age and the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage.\" Over the course of time, Swedenborg cannot, however, free himself from the demands of logic.

That is the conclusion to which he has already been led in Apocalypse Explained §992, and in Conjugial Love, it finds its complete development. After death a man remains a man and woman a woman as before. The partners continue to have the same married relation as on earth, but they are more delightful and more blessed (Conjugial Love §51). Swedenborg succeeds in eluding the declarations of the Gospel that humans never contract marriages after the resurrection by a rather hasty explanation that the biblical verse applies to spiritual marriage, that is to say, to the union of man with God, which is to be realized during earthly life (Conjugial Love §41). In one of his memorabilia, Swedenborg tells of three spirits newly come from earth who are greatly astonished to learn that the heavens contain the most beautiful girls and the handsomest young men. And they are still more surprised by the existence of marriages in the celestial realm and that conjugiallove displays the same forms as on earth. They ask of the angels: \"Is it not said in Scripture that marriage does not exist in the heavens, since we are all angels?\" To which the angelic spirits respond, \"Raise your eyes toward the heav­ ens and you will find the answer to your questions there.\" They then see the heavens open. Two angels approach, who say that marriage exists in heaven as on earth and that the words of the Gospel apply to spiritual marriage (Conjugial Love §44). This celestial love is chaste and pure because it constitutes a union, not of bodies alone, but also of souls. No infants are born of these unions, but they engender love and wisdom. By their union, the consorts impregnate each other with the human, which means the search for wisdom and attachment to what relates to this wisdom (Conjugial Love §§51-52). Only this union permits \"man to attain full perfection\" (homo in sua plenitudine). In heaven, the two consorts form only a single angel, for the man and the woman are so created that, together, they can constitute a single human being, a single flesh, each one separately being only half a man (Conjugial Love §37). In effect, the male has been created to comprehend the truth and the female to love the good. In the former, then, it is the reason and in the latter the will 305"

And from the fact that in God there exists a union between the good and the truth, a universal con­ jugial sphere (universalis sphera conjugialis) emanates from him which spreads throughout the entire universe, from the angels down to the worms. In conjugiallove, then, there exists a descending scale across the entire creation; in its lower form, it is sexual love. Having thus incorporated the marriage union as an indispens­ able element of his eschatology, Swedenborg is naturally obliged to acknowledge that new conjugial unions can be made in the future life. Most often two spouses do not meet again after death except dur­ ing the first external state in the world of spirits. When they ulti­ mately take the form according to the love that dominates them, they can no longer cohabit if their earthly marriage has been only an ex­ ternal union and not a true union of souls. They then separate, and each of them chooses another consort with whom they sense an inter­ nal communion (Conjugial Love §§47-50). Those who, in the course of their terrestrial life, have lived chastely in celibacy are authorized to marry if they have previously had the desire. If, on the other hand, they have remained reluctant to marry, they are allowed to continue their celibacy, but at the side of heaven itself. The existence of a per­ petual celibate sphere in effect disturbs the sphere of conjugial love, which is the true sphere of heaven (Conjugial Love §54). Conjugial love naturally has its antithesis in amor scortatorius (debased love), which has its origin in the Fall and consists in the con­ junction of evil and falsity. It is from this love that all the impurities of hell arise (Conjugial Love §§425-430) and is the final destiny of all those who lack conjugial love. Here Swedenborg restates his thesis that \"everyone, be he good or evil, is in his pleasure.\" Those who have abandoned themselves to adulterous love in their terrestrial lives are relegated to the dens of debauchery in hell, where they copulate like animals, mutually revile each other, and, despite their volup­ tuousness, feel only disgust and revulsion for their companions. It is in the description of the lives of the various categories of adulterous consorts that Swedenborg gives perhaps the widest scope to his poetic genius. The scene he paints of hell truly has something demonical and frightening that cannot fail to impress even a modern reader. The reprobates are led into hell by sirens who seduce them by 306"

If, in spite of everything, they do not renounce their unrestrained lust, they are cast down into still deeper hells. Their faces are pale and appear to be composed exclu­ sively of skin. Their voices are excessively dry, hoarse, their clothing is in rags, their gait is stooped. They eventually lose all sexual po­ tency, possessed by sex to the point of satiety (Conjugial Love §505, §51O). Conjugial Love is not, however, exclusively concerned with car­ nallove in the future life; it gives also a detailed psychological analy­ sis of marriage and erotic love on earth. We cannot give here a detailed exposition of this analysis, which, moreover, would be super­ fluous because we find the psychological schema of Swedenborg again here. Like the sphere of conjugial love that descends from heaven, the sphere of adulterous love rises from hell. Their meeting ground, which, in the spiritual world, is the world of spirits, is in the . mens of the human being (Conjugial Love §437). It does not appear to me to be necessary to pursue a description of Swedenborg's exposi­ tion of the state of equilibrium and of the intervention of free will. In the human being, the state of marriage exalts the faculties of the soul: with men, the mens rises toward a purer light; with women, toward a more ardent warmth. The inner levels of the soul open wider and wider so that the male sees and knows God intuitively, while from the anima light and love flow down into the lower parts, which are thus ennobled (Conjugial Love §191). This exaltation of the faculties is transmitted to the offspring in the form of receptivity to love and wisdom (Conjugial Love §204). It is evidently the contrary that occurs in adulterous love. Truly conjugial love is chaste in all its manifestations. But it is absolutely pure neither with humans nor angels. Beneath the spiri­ tual in humankind, there exists a natural level that is not chaste, and between the two there is a door on hinges. When this door is open, the chaste is mixed with what the unchaste (Conjugial Love §146). What I have just expounded appears to me to be sufficient to ex­ cuse me from further insistence on Swedenborg's conjugial doctrine.

Although Sweden borg's doctrine of conjugial love can, in its minute details, be included in his system, we may nonetheless won­ der what motivated him to give marriage and carnal love such an im­ portant place in his doctrine. Already in connection with the dreams of his religious crisis, I have pointed out the strangely marked erotic character of Swedenborg's dispositions. Unfortunately, we do not know much about his amorous encounters. The anecdote found in most of his biographies of his unhappy love for Emerentia, the youngest of Polhem's daughters, seems to have been somewhat ro­ manticized. It owes its origin to a rather doubtful source-an anony­ mous document that was read in 1789 at the Exegetic-Philanthropic Society in Stockholm. According to this document, Polhem gave Swedenborg a writ­ ten commitment to give him his daughter Emerentia in marriage, and would have obliged the young girl, who at the time was not more than fifteen, to sign this promise. 264 The girl was so chagrined by this that, moved by pity, her brother Gabriel stole the contract from Sweden borg, whose sole joy it was to reread it daily. He was so moved by this loss that Polhem insisted on learning the cause of his sorrow, and then he declared himself ready to return the document to him. But in view of the young lady's despair, Swedenborg himself re­ nounced his rights and left the Polhem home. He solemnly declared that he would never again become attached to any woman and that he would never again entertain the idea of becoming engaged. Fol­ lowing this, he undertook his voyages abroad. Finally, this document tells us that Swedenborg had later, in his old age, assured Emerentia's daughters and their husbands, when they visited him in his garden, that he talked to their late mother as often as he wished. The only document that permits us to verify the above account is a letter from Swedenborg to Benzelius dated September 14, 1718 (Opera 1,286). From this letter, it appears that Polhem had first prom­ ised him his elder daughter Maria: \"The older daughter of Polhem is affianced to a gentleman of the King named Manderstrom; I ask my­ self what people say, for she was my promised; the other daughter is in my opinion much prettier.\"265 As we see, Swedenborg seems to 308"

In any case, as Tafel remarks on the basis of a letter from Pol hem to Benzelius, Sweden­ borg had broken all relations with Polhem, by whom, according to the latter, he had been pampered like a child.266 It is possible that, during the following six months, Swedenborg may have demanded the hand of the younger sister, Emerentia, and that his repulse in this new project may have provoked the break. Nevertheless, it appears more likely that his animosity toward Pol­ hem may have been due to the deception he experienced in not be­ coming his son-in-law at all, rather than his rather sudden love for Emerentia. This supposition is furthermore confirmed by the fact that, in a conversation with the Danish General Tuxen,267 Sweden­ borg certainly alludes to the blow to his project of marriage with Maria Polhem when he tells his interlocutor about his sole incursion on the way to marriage. 268 But he does not speak of any vow never to marry, and there are several reasons to believe that later he was not absolutely opposed to the idea of making a good marriage. On the rest of his loves, we are, if possible, even less informed. Robsahm relates in his memoirs: \"It is known further that Sweden­ borg has possessed a mistress whom he abandoned after she had de­ ceived him, but otherwise one finds no trace of illicit amours.\"269 Tafel has vainly taken infinite pains to prove that this piece of infor­ mation was due to a false interpretation of Swedenborg's demand for the hand of Emerentia Polhem. Using strange reasons, he has also tried to show what was implausible in Tuxen's anecdote, in which he asked Sweden borg whether he had succeeded in remaining free from all carnal temptation. Swedenborg replied, \"Not completely; in my youth I had a mistress in ltaly.\"27o Given the complete absence of any contradictory declaration by Swedenborg himself and of any contrary affirmation by contempo­ raries, it is clearly impossible to rebut these assertions categorically as false. On the contrary, they appear to be corroborated by the Journal of Dreams, where Swedenborg declares that \"the taste for women\" was \"his dominant passion.\" This, moreover, confirms the terribly sensual character of his dreams.

Without any doubt, he put him­ self in this category. Also extramarital relations ifornicatio) seem to him a minor sin in the degree they relate to conjugiallove. That is to say, one is internally in marital love to the degree that one prefers this love to the impure state of fornication. And if we then continue to have extramarital sexual relations, it is by necessity (Conjugial Love §§450-452). For infornicatio, conjugiallove can be concealed like the spiritual within the natural (Conjugial Love §449). Fornicatio consti­ tutes an intermediate stage between conjugial love and debauchery and can be a preparation for either. Thus, he counsels young men who cannot marry and do not feel capable of mastering their desires to take a mistress in order not to be perverted by promiscuity. Thanks to the crisis of the Journal of Dreams, Swedenborg con­ sidered himself to have been cured from his \"dominant passion\"; and during the final thirty years of his life, he probably lived in absolute celibacy. He seems to have been rather intimidated by women, and this timidity seems to have increased during his solitary bachelor­ hood. Robsahm relates that Swedenborg never allowed a woman to enter his chamber without the presence of a third party, \"for he knew that woman is artful and that he could be accused by one of them of having sought to know her too intimately.\" The facts that I have attempted to assemble above as impartially as possible appear to me to lead to this conclusion: that Swedenborg was never permitted to taste the pure joy of love, although the inten­ sity of his erotic instincts made it appear to him as the highest of all earthly joys. This is why he transposes these joys to the future life. It is for him not only a logical necessity, but even a true psychic need, to include in celestial marriage all the physical pleasures of terrestrial union. His indiscreet and uselessly detailed descriptions of conjugial joys in heaven-the constant amorous ardor of male angels, the \"sixth sense\" of female angels, \"this sense of the joys of conjugiallove in the male\"-are explained by this need.

That Swedenborg himself may have hoped to enjoy in another world all the conjugial joys that had been denied him in this one is indicated by a testimony that has been transmitted by a tradition among Swedenborgians and was published for the first time by J. J. G. Wilkinson. It offers a clue that bears all the signs of authenticity. According to this tradition, Swedenborg was accustomed to say that it had been given to him to see his future spouse in the spiritual world, who was waiting for him there; on earth, she had borne the name of Countess Gyllenborg. This countess was the wife of Fredrik Gyllenborg, born Elisabeth Stierncrona, a lady of Pietistic tendencies and authoress of a book of piety in two volumes, The Best Part of Mary. Since 1733 at least, Swedenborg was intimately associated with her husband and with her father, Fredrik Gyllenborg, who died in 1759 and was relegated by Swedenborg to hell because of his domi­ nating spirit. It is known that Gyllenborg was a politician given to in­ trigue, one of the most rabid of the \"era of liberty.\" His widow, who survived him by ten years, could then look forward to a divorce and a new marriage in the future life. It would be not at all just to build a romance on these simple facts. It may well be that the lady remained ignorant of the position that Swedenborg reserved for her in the future life. It may even be conceded that the idea of making her his celestial bride only came to Sweden borg after the countess's death. Even with this reservation, the anecdote is no less interesting in that it supports the close connec­ tions between Sweden borg's doctrine of heavenly marriage and his own amorous hopes. Swedenborg evidently considered himself as one of those who lived in celibacy but had longed for a companion and may be admitted into heaven to contract marriage there. Finally, it appears from this anecdote that, during several years at least, and perhaps since the death of Fredrik Gyllenborg and his relegation to hell, the dreams of Swedenborg of the holy \"joys of marriage\" had a precise objective. If one wishes to judge the sexual ethic of Sweden borg equitably, such as he professes it in Conjugial Love, it is evidently necessary to consider it against the background of the epoch when he lived, one of 311"

Although he lived apart from mundane life during his whole theosophical period, he could not avoid seeing to what degree the obligations of marriage were neglected, and he complained of it repeatedly in his works. He har­ bored no illusions about the purity of human behavior. When he de­ scribes the proposal of marriage, he maintains that the choice belongs to the man, not to the woman, because the love of the man is ad­ dressed to the sex in general, while that of the woman has the object of a single representative of the opposite sex. \"If you wish to be con­ vinced,\" he adds, \"ask the men you meet if they prefer monogamy or polygamy, and you will find hardly a single one who does not pro­ nounce for polygamy\" (Conjugial Love §296). It is this pessimistic view of the male incapacity to observe sex­ ual continence that explains the tolerance that serves so often to prove his moral norm. We recall here his opinion of ,,!ornicatio\" and the counsel he gives to young people who are not capable of controlling their desires. In certain cases, he would even allow a husband to take a concubine. Clearly, one cannot judge his morality by the measure of our own, no more than one can with the sexual morality of Luther. It is beyond doubt that Conjugial Love, which one sees frequently classi­ fied as an immoral work, even in the most modern expositions, was written with the object of reestablishing the sanctity of marriage. This book, then, earns a rank among the tenacious attempts made in this regard in all countries during this period. It is not by pure chance that Sweden borg is a contemporary of Richardson and Rousseau. Conjugial Love is, more than any other work of the century, an apo­ theosis of marriage and family life. For Luther, the human sexual instinct is a necessity of nature. Human beings have been created by God to live in a state of mar­ riage, not of celibacy. Also it is the married, and not the cloistered, life that can bear the name \"Order der reinen Keuschheit\" (the order of chastity). To shackle this natural instinct by vows of chastity is the equivalent of placing an obstacle to the work of the Divine, and thus monastic vows cannot be binding. \"In the absence of any divine mir­ acle, true chastity hovers protectively in the highest degree over mar­ riage, and in the weakest degree over the state of virginity.\"271 312"

For him, not only is marriage itself chaste, but sexual inter­ course is as welL272 All the enjoyments of a true marriage, even the most exalted, are chaste (Conjugial Love §144). The expressions \"chaste and unchaste\" are only specifically applicable to marriage and to all that depends on it (Conjugial Love §139). We may not, then, qualify as chaste those who have made the vow of celibacy, unless the love of a truly conjugiallife persists within them. Swedenborg says he asked angels whether those who have sought piety, consecrated themselves to the adoration of God, have turned away from the van­ ities of the world and desires of the flesh, and who have made a vow of chastity, will be accepted in heaven. The angels answered him that such people could not stand the sphere of conjugial love and that a place is reserved for them outside of heaven. After their death, monks and nuns are therefore released from their vows so that they may choose between the conjugiallife in heaven and the celibate life outside of heaven (Conjugial Love §155). Just as Sweden borg, in condemning the traditional doctrine of the redemption and in proclaiming the activity of love, believed he was pursuing the route Luther was engaged in without having been able to travel it to the end and thought he had destroyed the last vestiges of the spiritual traffic in indulgences, so he also believed that his doctrine of spiritual marriage effaced the last traces of monastic mysticism that persisted in Lutheranism. We have already seen that, in the course of his crisis, he gives free course to an ec­ static love of the Christ that is certainly related to the Moravian doc­ trine. During his theological period, he busies himself in a diametrically opposite way. His exposition of the \"marriage of the Lord with the Church\" is particularly sober and abstract, and he de­ nies explicitly that this union has an equivalent in celestial or terres­ trial marriages. It is thus incorrect to relate, as is so often done, Swedenborg's doctrine of spiritual marriage to this aspiration towards the divine Bridegroom that is found again and again in Christian mysticism, particularly in Catholic mysticism. His doctrine, on the contrary, has the purpose of combatting this confusion between the love of God and erotic longing. By giving eros a purpose in eternal life, he raises it 313"

Even though Swedenborg's affirmation of the sexual and mari­ tal character of love in its most noble form contradicts the eros of Plato, his system presents, as Lagerborg has proposed, a marked Pla­ tonic imprint in the universal role that he attributes to love.273 It is the fundamental love (amor Jundamentalis) for all that is heavenly and spiritual and, consequently, natural love (Conjugial Love §65). Born of the union between the good and the true, between wis­ dom and love, it conducts those who possess it not only to a greater love but also to a higher wisdom (Conjugial Love §188). It follows that it is the treasure of human life and of the Christian religion (Conjugial Love §457). It is also the source of beauty. For it is neither wisdom alone nor love alone that creates beauty, but the conjunction of the two. Beauty is an enjoyment of sight, born of the union of love with wisdom. It is the reason virgins in heaven sparkle with light like diamonds, while wives reflect the fire of rubies (Conjugial Love §384). It is plain that this erotic metaphysics and this esthetic eroticism ulti­ mately go back to Platonic impulses, even though Swedenborg may have modified these doctrines according to his own ends. On the other hand, it seems to me difficult to follow Lagerborg when he claims that Swedenborg is full of \"mythological phantas­ magoria.\" One might perhaps discover a remote affinity with Plato's idea of the primordial androgyne, or the perfect hermaphrodite, in Swedenborg's idea that the consorts united in heaven are fused into one angel. No doubt the earthly man is, for Swedenborg, but a half that will only become complete in the future life, by the union with his better half. But since Swedenborg never acknowledges the doc­ trine of preexistence here, any more than elsewhere, this analogy does not reach very far. It is by moral conduct during his life on earth that a man determines the person with whom he will conjoin himself in the future life. For Swedenborg, spiritual marriage gives to heavenly happiness its idyllic-one is tempted to say pastoral-character. For these are, in reality, the contemporary dreams of an Arcadia of eternal spring, an eternal youth, eternal innocence, and eternal fidelity in the love that Swedenborg reproduces in his descriptions of marriage in 314"

Men are clothed in hyacinth-hued mantles and white tunics, the women in purple togas. One even sees rams and ewes that are \"representatives of the inno­ cence and peace among the mountaineers.\" And when these couples converse regarding marital love, their tents take on hues of gold (Conjugial Love §7S). In most of his memorabilia, Swedenborg introduces us into a fairyland; rose gardens, groves with limpid springs, lawns sur­ rounded by trees cheerfully interlaced by winding grapevines. He likewise discovers that everywhere in heaven there exist sites where weddings are conducted, little gardens surrounded by intertwining branches of trees, flowering shrubbery exhaling a soft fragrance. These are \"nuptial gardens\" (Conjugial Love §316).1t appears that the southern nature Swedenborg had occasion to admire during his voy­ ages and of which no trace is found in his travel notes, has reappeared in a form embellished by time, along with the dreams of celestial unions in his old age. Here I would like to relate several of the more beautiful of Swedenborg's memorabilia, which rank among the most poetic pas­ sages of his writings and of all the literature of eighteenth-century Sweden. The unequaled richness of their fablelike morality does not permit me to realize this desire, however. Moreover, their complicated symbolism makes them entirely accessible only to a reader who is fa­ miliar with Swedenborg's system. Nevertheless, I believe I should briefly summarize at least one of these visions, which, if not one of the most beautiful, has the advantage of being one of the more intelligible. Meditating one day on conjugial love, Swedenborg sees two naked infants approaching him from a distance, bearing baskets and accompanied by a flight of turtledoves. As they come nearer, he per­ ceives that they are crowned by roses and that garlands of lilies and bluish-purple roses hang on them obliquely from shoulder to waist, held together by a chain of foliage mixed with olive twigs: But as they came yet nearer they did not appear as infants, nor naked, but as two persons in the first bloom of life, clad in robes 315"

They were two married partners from heaven. Swedenborg then learns from them that they have been united in heaven for centuries and that there reign in heaven a sun and a perpetual spring. This is what the vision symbolizes. And they con­ duct Swedenborg into other interiors of heaven, where everything, even housekeeping utensils, have celestial forms and sparkle with gold and rubies. He then learns that the wives who now look like maidens were old women and that the husbands who appear to be young men were, at the time of their death, tottering old men. They loved each other reciprocally, and their religion caused them to avoid adultery as the worst of sins. This is the reason God has led them back to the most beautiful age of their life for eternity (Conjugial Love §137). To Swedenborg's mind, then, it is conjugiallove that gives all its poesy to the blessings of heaven. And it is thanks to this love that an­ gels live perpetually in sunny Elysian fields, that they appear to each other as young people in the flower of youth, and that they are sur­ rounded by delicious gardens and perfumes of springtime verdure and flowers of spring. For youth, light, fragrances, and the warmth of spring are only representatives of the warmth of their own love and the light of their own wisdom. The more closely they are united in love, the more the golden air that bathes them shines, the softer the odors of flowers become, and the younger they appear in their own eyes and in those of their companions. For as Swedenborg writes elsewhere (Arcana Coelestia §553), \"they who are united in heaven in mutual love perpetually advance to the springtime of their youth, a springtime becoming ever more enchanting and ever more holy; in the measure that their common life accumulates thousands of years.\" In my exposition of Swedenborg's ideas of the spiritual world, I have deliberately avoided drawing detailed parallels with earlier 316"

Comparisons I myself have made have no doubt revealed certain analogies with prior conceptions of the nature of angels, heavenly life, purgatory, hell, etc.; but it has been in general a matter of details without great importance for Swedenborgian doc­ trine as a whole. The relationship between this doctrine and diverse biblical representations of a future life derive from biblical quotations Swedenborg almost never fails to invoke in support of his theses. Nevertheless, here is reason to bear in mind the freedom of in­ terpretation that validates his exegetical method. The deep imprint of antiquity on his descriptions of celestial beatitude is also so manifest that it hardly needs mentioning. It is notably to this source that there is reason to attribute the role he gives to physical exercises and the fine arts in the life of angels. All his descriptions of heavenly joys quite naturally recall the picture of the Elysian fields given in the Aeneid. And again in the philosophical discussions under the porticos of the schools of wisdom, which recur so frequently in his work, we find the environment of Plato's Dialogues. The links that some have occasionally wished to establish with Dante tend to conflate the bibli­ cal and classical representations of the future life. Nothing allows me to assume that Swedenborg had known Dante or felt his influence. On the other hand, Swedenborg's representations of the future life, in their totality, clearly bear the imprint of his time and his own personality. In the world of spirits, where the dead have lost only their external physical envelope, we find a faithful reflection of ter­ restrial conditions as they appear to him. He has given us his judg­ ment of the characteristics of the different nations and the effects of different religions on their adherents. That he had early felt a lively interest in ethnology is a fact that is attested by his traveler's note­ books, in which he provided ample space for comments on the char­ acteristics of diverse peoples and churches. No doubt one finds numerous eccentricities in his descriptions of corresponding condi­ tions in the world of spirits. But it would be vain to deny that he gives frequent proof of a psychological perspicacity and a familiarity with the habits of life of different peoples that one would hardly expect of a traveler who had led such a retiring life abroad.

If, in this spirit, we read the characteristics Swedenborg gives them, in most cases we come to form a fairly clear idea of the manner in which he conceives them. When, later, he is to have the vision of the Last Judgment, he will find added occasion to pass in review over all his contemporaries, in­ dividuals, sects, societies, and peoples. With Sweden borg, no ardent hate of parties is found, such as that which gives such color to Dante's Inferno. But thanks precisely to their sober and measured tone, the judgments of Swedenborg give an impression of inexorable severity. It is thus that, in the sepulchral description he gives, for example, of a promenade in the streets of Stockholm in the world of spirits, there unfolds an impression of funereal terror. The majority of the houses are closed and silent, for their owners are spiritually dead. Heaven and hell are objects of a more fantastic description, but here too we again find without difficulty the characteristic traits of the epoch. To Swedenborg's mind, hell is not at all a place of punish­ ment. Unlike in the classical and many of the Christian accounts, the reprobates are not condemned to be deprived of what was their pleasure on earth or forced to occupying themselves with what they detested here. On the contrary, even in hell, they harden themselves in their crimes and sins. For the Lord punishes no one; evil is so inti­ mately attached to its own punishment that it cannot be separated (Heaven and Hell §550). Also hell becomes the type of criminal, law­ less society, which so many of the satirists of the eighteenth century described in a more or less veiled form. Its inhabitants, possessed by egoism, experience neither remorse nor repentance, which would be the first indication of reform in them. Every trace of conscience among them has been forever extinguished, and they have no other ambition than to do evil. They want to dominate everything, they seek to injure each other and to enjoy themselves at each other's ex­ pense. It is precisely the impossibility of satisfying all their desires that constitutes their torture. Likewise, Swedenborg's heaven is the realm of Utopia.

It is the land of in­ nocence, of the beauty of youth of the Golden Age of which the poets sing---or rather nature in its state of integrity to which Rousseau . dreamed of returning humanity. The habitual representations of beatitude are basically rather alien to Swedenborgianism. For Swedenborg, celestial joys are not at all passive ones: they consist of action, of doing something useful for oneself or others. Thus, the celestial realm includes workshops, trades and tradesmen, handicraft, courts of justice, and libraries where each of the angels can find occupations that best respond to his or her tastes. Do we not find in these dreams of the blessings \"of use­ fulness\" a true son of the century of power and rural economy, with all its zealous utility? Do we not see, outlined behind the religious dreamer, the image of an indefatigable traveler of the spirit, for whom undisturbed work at his desk was in reality the only true happiness? But this spiritual world, where we all laugh and cry, love and hate, work and play, quite like in our own, could never become a gross copy of reality. For there all things are only representations, equivalents of states of soul of the inhabitants. All these marvelous sceneries, all their handsome adolescents, all their beautiful maidens appear to the eyes of the angels according to the state of their love and wisdom. They change, disappear, and reappear like mirages accord­ ing to the degree of modification of the thoughts and feeling of the angels. \"Whoever becomes an angel carries within himself his own heaven\" (Conjugial Love §10). Likewise, the inhabitants of the world of spirits and hell live in an environment that perfectly harmonizes with their interior, and which itself is irradiation. It is in this thought that we find perhaps the most genial trait of Sweden borg's eschatology, and in the fashion he develops it, we find perhaps his grandest artistic contribution. Thanks to his gift for sur­ rounding his spiritual world with a net of symbolism, structured in earthly representations, he has succeeded in giving it something of the fantastic character, dreamlike and ethereal, that it probably had in his own visions. 319"

      "text": "twelve THE LAST JUDGMENT AND THE NEW JERUSALEM The ten last years of Swedenborg's life were for the most part de­ voted to apocalyptic speculations. His thoughts revolved constantly around the Last Judgment that it had been given him to witness in the spiritual world, and the consequent institution of the new Jerusalem. Sweden borg's earlier conceptions of the Last Judgment do not seem to be far removed from the orthodox views. The mention of these which he made in the De Anima (Animal Kingdom VII, 249) car­ ries no individual imprint and even when, in the first part of the Ad­ versa ria (222) he interprets the biblical account of the destruction of Sod om and Gomorrah allegorically as a prophecy of the Last Judg­ ment, he remains faithful, point by point, to the letter of the Apoca­ lypse. The Messiah himself will come, surrounded by his angels, to judge the living and the dead in heaven and on earth. Little by little, Swedenborg begins to find that this interpreta­ tion contradicted his eschatology. We recall that, to his mind, the judgment will strike every human being after death; and, after an often very long sojourn in the world of spirits, the individual will go to heaven or to hell and remain there for eternity. Furthermore, Swedenborg does not acknowledge the orthodox doctrine according to which the human being is, at the end of the world, reintegrated into the body he or she occupied on this earth. Above all, he cannot accept the customary interpretation of the apocalyptic prophesies, for 320"

Thus, at a rather early date, he comes to think that the Last Judgment was not destined to strike our earth literally, but only the world of spirits, into which, with the passage of time, a certain disor­ der had slipped in. As early as 1747, he has visions that are portents of a last judgment in this sense (Spiritual Diary §220).274 And in the Ar­ cana Coelestia §931[2], he declares that those who await a universal catastrophe on the occurrence of a last judgment are in error. This final reckoning refers to the last days of the church. Every church un­ dergoes its last judgment when it is corrupted and when it no longer possesses a living faith. The first church, which disappeared in the Deluge, has already been struck by its last judgment; the same applies to the Jewish church, which perished with the descent of Jesus Christ upon the earth. The judgment is now imminent for the current Christian church, which will be replaced by a new one. It is clear that, from the beginning, Swedenborg is thinking of his own doctrine. It is he who, like a new messiah, will announce his doctrine to the world and who will create, in the form of a new church, the new heaven and the new earth of which the Apocalypse speaks. The primitive Christian religion was made up of love and faith, but it has degenerated and is no more than a religion of exter­ nal adoration. The Christianity that now rules is ripe for replacement by a New Church, by a New Jerusalem (see, for example, Arcana Coelestia §1850). And by all signs, he observes that the time is near. The world of spirits is so full of genii and evil spirits that humanity is perpetually exposed to deadly influences from them and that even the angels are barely able to resist them (Arcana Coelestia §2121 passim). In the Spiritual Diary §765, Sweden borg relates that one day­ February 13, 1748-he had a vision of the number 57. He appears to have at first interpreted it as 1657, the significance of which he did not understand. He did not delay, nevertheless, in connecting this number with his expectations of a last judgment, following which de­ generate Christianity would give place to a new church, of which he himself would be the revelator, at a time he fixes in 1757. Over the greater part of that year, it is given to him to see this Last Judgment, which he has prophesied, become a reality. His 321"

In addition, we find descriptions of and commentaries on the Last Judgment in his later works, above all in the two commentaries the Apocalypse Explained and the Apocalypse Revealed. Although the initial descriptions of the Spiritual Diary may be more colorful and interesting, I must base my argument on the works published by Sweden borg himself, where the rather diffuse exposition of the Spiritual Diary has been systematized. When the Book of Revelation announces that the first heaven and the first earth shall pass away and be replaced by a new earth and a new heaven, this does not at all mean, Swedenborg explains, that our earth and the heaven of angels are to be destroyed and make place for a new earth and a new heaven. God does not judge human­ ity during earthly life, nor does he deprive those who are in heaven of the celestial bliss. Consequently, the Last Judgment cannot affect the humanity presently alive or the angels. By the first heaven is to be understood the dwelling places which, after the first coming of Christ upon earth, were assigned to those who have been externally good, but not internally just. They may have been just and honest according to civil and moral law, but not regarding divine laws. Since divine order requires that all those who could be saved should be saved, they had been allowed to stay in these dwelling places as long as they could endure to live among the good. They had created for themselves spiritual societies on the high­ est levels in the world of spirits, most often on mountains and rocks, and had even created the appearance of a heaven. This collection of pretended pious beings, who aspired to be­ come angels but were powerless to attain this state, had become so numerous that it absorbed the rays of divine light and heat. These so­ cieties extended like a dense fog across the sky, obscuring the rays of the divine sun. The living races on earth thereby risked becoming unable to maintain the equilibrium between heaven and hell that is 322"

The danger continued to inten­ sify; in the course of the degeneracy of the church, the number of be­ ings going to hell became greater and greater while that of the beings admitted into heaven diminished in an equal proportion, so that the divine influx continuously weakened in relation to that from hell (Last Judgment passim; Apocalypse Revealed §865). The great Babylon of which the Book of Revelation speaks is found among the Catholics. 275 Swedenborg gives a particularly se­ vere exposition of the Catholic Church, which he abhors primarily because it has falsified the word of the Bible and kept it hidden from the people, thereby closing the door to heaven. In the world of the spirits, the Catholics have set up a complete replica of their organiza­ tion on earth, with papal consistory, cloisters, saint worship, and so forth (Last Judgment §§55-56). It would lead us far afield here to recapitulate the destruction of that Babylonian structure during the Last Judgment, how it was dev­ astated by earthquakes and storms from the east and its inhabitants thrown into a dark sea. These reports are written with a certain dra­ matic energy that is exceptional in Swedenborg's writings. This time his visionary fantasy has surely been tinged by the profuse color of the Apocalypse of St. John. The Muslims and the Gentiles are found out­ side the sphere of the Catholics in \"the first heaven.\" Inside, in the center of heaven, Protestants of various confessions have their abode. Among the former, the Africans are particularly accomplished. When they are instructed by the angels, they grasp and receive the truths better than others because their way of thinking is more inter­ nal and spiritual (Continuation o/the Last Judgment §75) Sweden borg's preference for Africans goes back very far. In the Spiritual Diary §453, he relates that, in 1748, he had met African spir­ its who, in the other life, wished to be chastised and tortured. They told him that they detested their black bodies, for they knew that their souls are white. He also learns that more souls from Africa came into heaven than from any other continent. I do not know the cause of Swedenborg's love for the blacks of Central Africa, which fits the age of Rousseau so well. In any case, he kept it all his life; and in the Last Judgment §76, he affirms that Africans likewise have the same pious character in our terrestrial world. In the interior of their 323"

The angels orally teach the natives the same doctrines that Swedenborg himself has professed in The New Jerusalem. The Reformed are admitted at the very center of heaven be­ cause they have read the Bible and worshiped the Lord, and therefore they have enjoyed a more brilliant light. They have, however, the common fault: their religion is purely external. They have attended worship, been present at all the rituals, and confessed their faith in God; but they have neglected the moral prescriptions of the Gospel and have not amended their lives. It is they who are symbolized by the dragon of the Apocalypse (Continuation of the Last Judgment §§14-16). At the center of all the Christians dwell the best of the English. These in effect have a double theology, one of which has its source in the doctrine of faith and the other in that of life. This latter theology is found among those who do not belong to the clergy (Con­ tinuation of the Last Judgment §§40-45). The description of the Last Judgment itself is an allegorical paraphrase of the Apocalypse. It is presaged by a storm cloud, after which the upper heavens come down. In the clarity of the light of heaven, the internal world of the spirits opens, and the impious ap­ pear no more like Christians but like devils, and a feverish struggle begins among them regarding God, Scripture, faith, and the Church. All the glory by which they have been surrounded in their imaginary heaven vanishes. Their palaces become miserable huts, their gardens seas of mud, and their churches a heap of filth (Continuation of the Last Judgment §23). They then receive the visit of angels who try to the end to persuade them to renounce their evil ways. These angels succeed in separating some just spirits who are among the evil. But the others persevere in their sins and consequently are unable to es­ cape the judgment. The Lord then appears in a luminous cloud, and the fanfares of trumpets are heard, which invites the angels to assemble the just from all directions. For the Lord does not desire the perdition of the sinner and limits himself to freeing them from all contact with the evil; these are then left entirely to their own devices.

I have cited these descriptions because they confirm how much Sweden borg seeks to show that God does not condemn anyone, not even in the Last Judgment. He is the Redeemer who saves his faith­ ful; he and is not the judge, properly speaking. The malevolent judge themselves when their inner being is stripped naked and they lose the veneer of respectability and piety that had covered them in the world of spirits. They hurl themselves into hell because only there do they feel among their peers. Like the newcomers, the dragon tries to rise toward the divine light; but it is too strong for him, and he falls blindly into the abyss. The state of the world after the Last Judgment will be what it was before. The great change of the spiritual world will entail no per­ ceptible modification of our world. There will be, as previously, na­ tions, wars, and periods of peace. From the superficial point of view, there will also be, as in the past, different churches, each with its dif­ ferent dogmas. But church members will now enjoy a greater inde­ pendence in questions of faith because they will have recovered their spiritual freedom. Order has now been reestablished in the heavens and in hell, and the normal equilibrium reigns anew between them. Thus, the spiritual sense of the Scriptures can be unveiled without room for doubt that it may be misunderstood or profaned (Last Judg­ ment §73). The most important consequence of the Last Judgment is, nev­ ertheless, the creation of the New Jerusalem, the New Church that Swedenborg, as we have seen, had long before announced. The new heaven created by God after the Last Judgment is destined to yield place to this church, which is to include the best among Christians and also among pagans who have lived since the epoch of Christ (New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine §§2-3). From heaven, the New Jerusalem will later descend upon the earth. During the Last Judgment, Swedenborg had already had vi­ sions that seemed to presage a descent of this New Church upon the earth (Spiritual Diary §5543), but he delays in declaring its full accomplishment.

Two years later he writes from Amsterdam to Beyer that the Church will only come about to the extent that the doctrines of salvation and of imputation will have been exterminated. Moreover, the Christian Church was not born immediately after the ascension of Jesus Christ, but developed gradually.276 In True Chris­ tian Religion §791, he declares that the very day he finished this work, June 19, 1770, the Lord has gathered his twelve disciples and sent them out through the spiritual world, there to \"preach the gospel that the Lord Jesus Christ reigns and that his reign will endure from eter­ nity to eternity.\" Swedenborg is convinced that this concerted work will assure the triumph of his doctrine. \"I am persuaded,\" he writes to Beyer in the course of its publication, \"that our Redeemer Lord will act both directly and indirectly, when the book will have appeared, in order that the New Church which is founded on this theology, will be insti­ tuted throughout all Christianity.\" And in the last chapter of the book, he develops the mission that has been entrusted to him to create new universal churches destined to supplant the present age. The predictions of the prophets, the evangelists, and the Apocalypse, in effect, have in view his own exegesis. When it is said that the Lord shall come in the clouds of heaven in His glory and power, this does not mean that Christ will descend again in person upon the earth. According to the Gospel of John, God is the Word, and it is in this quality that he is to come on the earth. \"It is idle, therefore, to believe that the Lord will appear in the clouds of heaven in person; but he is to appear in the Word, which is from him and therefore is himself\" (True Christian Religion §777.)

(True Christian Religion §779) The proud awareness of his own mission, explicit in this pas­ sage, is not a new thing for Swedenborg. But this is the first time that he proclaims it publicly and signs his name on the title page under \"Domini Jesu Christi Servus\" (servant of the Lord Jesus Christ). And in one of his memorabilia in True Christian Religion §508, he says he has had the vision of a temple with a door of mother-of-pearl and wells of crystal. It signified the New Church, and \"when I drew nearer, I saw this inscription above the door, Nunc Licet, which signi­ fied that now it is permitted to enter intellectually into the mysteries of faith.\" It is no coincidence that this vision recalls Swedenborg's first vi­ sionary revelation, the luminous redemptive vision that revealed to him the existence of a \"holy temple\" in the brain and brought him back to the state of innocence of the first man. The association with the Divinity, broken by the Fall, and which was at that moment re­ gained thanks to his biblical exegesis, was conquered once again for the totality of all humanity. \"Enter henceforth into the mysteries of the Word hitherto closed,\" an angel from the third heaven instructs him, \"for these particular truths are so many mirrors of the Lord.\" By the revelation of the Word, the world has become a resplendent tem­ ple where the glory of the Lord is reflected in the eyes of whoever wishes to see. In my investigation, I have sought to elucidate the diverse stages of this evolution. We have seen that Swedenborg had early under­ gone great discouragement on the scientific front, which he then con­ sidered as the only one accessible to humanity, and that he had longed for a knowledge that was not reduced to traveling the long, unsure, and roundabout route of sensory testimony. In this state of mind, he received the first divine sign, the interior light that gave a higher con­ firmation to this hypotheses. Shortly afterwards, his explanation was 327"

How denuded of value the uncer­ tainties of science then appear compared to the doctrine that sees in external phenomena only symbols of a higher life, and in natural things only reflections of things spiritual! In the doctrine of corre­ spondences, he rediscovers the wisdom humanity enjoyed at the be­ ginning of time, but which it lost when it turned away from the Divine. His entire energy now focuses on a single goal: to become worthy of this higher wisdom. The Journal of Dreams and the account he gives in The Worship and Love of God of the state of innocence of Adam inform us how he came to the purpose he proposed for him­ self through unreserved renunciation and annihilation of his own selfhood. Once he himself had been admitted into the spiritual world and had been allowed to contemplate its glory, the aim of his life became to reveal to humanity the spiritual sense of the Word. All the inex­ pressible wisdom of the angels, in which the awakening of his inner sight permitted him to share, is found concealed in the Word that has been given to humanity as a link between us and the Creator, but which we have forgotten and whose true sense we have not been able to preserve since our love has been diverted from heavenly things to­ ward worldly things. And when Swedenborg has finished his mission and has revealed the spiritual sense of the Scriptures and related to humanity what he has seen in the spiritual world, a new era will be born in the history of our species. The Last Judgment has cleansed space in the spiritual world for the New Church that will again con­ join the human race to God and lead creation to its final end. Thus, in the light of Sweden borg's inner evolution, we come to understand that his mind was prepared for the idea that his own bib­ lical exegesis constitutes the return of the Messiah, which the prophets had announced. 328"

In another passage (p. 1088) Tafel-apparently with rea­ son---comes close to this affirmation of the mandate Swedenborg claims to have received from God, on April 25-26, 1744, not to read any work on theol­ ogy or similar subjects. It would seem to follow that, prior to this date, Swedenborg considered himself to be entirely free in this respect. 79. Swedenborgs Resebeskrifningar, 65. 80.

We find confirmation in the fact that, in one of his last theological works, De Commercio Animae et Corporis (The Interaction of the Soul and the Body [1769]), where he explains that the spiritual sun, emanating from God, appears to the angels in the form of a globe, just like our sun. He points out that every­ one knows from experience that spiritual light assures certitude, \"for man perceives the light of his reason to the extent that he achieves certitude .... I have often seen that spiritual light. It immensely exceeds natural light in whiteness and also in splendor, for it is as whiteness and splendor themselves and appears like bright and dazzling snow, as the garments of the Lord ap­ peared when he was transfigured\" (Ibid., §6). 99.

At any rate, it makes no difference whether we give the flu­ idum spirituosum itself the name of anima or of spirit, or whether we restrict that nomenclature to the faculty it possesses of representing the universe and having the intuition of ends. For among the highest unities of the series, we cannot distinguish the substance from its functions (Economy of the Animal Kingdom II, §303). Swedenborg also uses throughout the termfluidum spiritu­ osum as a synonym for anima. 103. It is not within the scope of this study to deal here with the epoch-making lo­ calizations of cerebral phenomena established by Swedenborg.

      "text": "NOTES Is Swedenborg's Conception of the Cerebral Functions Based?\", Ramstrom gave a very interesting exposition of the hypothesis at the root of the results Sweden borg achieved in his research into cerebral psychology. This is, as far as we know, the only historico-critical study of Swedenborg's scientific theo­ ries undertaken to date [1917]. 104. Under the rubric of \"ideas,\" Swedenborg manifestly includes (like Descartes) the whole content of our understanding. Under \"material ideas\" (also a Carte­ sian term), it seems necessary to include sensory perceptions. They appear to be identical with \"images,\" which, according to the theory expounded above, are the impressions evoked in the anima. 105. This Aristotelian concept, which also betrays the influence of the traducian­ ism of Tertullian and the later Church Fathers (cf. Economy of the Animal Kingdom II, §31O), is maintained in Swedenborg's theological works. 106. Regarding the following, cf. Spiess, 58ff. 107. In his theological period, Swedenborg likewise joins the animus and the mens. For example, we find in Cornelius Agrippa an exact equivalent of the clarifi­ cation given in the Economy of the Animal Kingdom. For him, the soul consists of the mens, the ratio, and the idolum. The mens is the receiving organ of divine light that thereby penetrates the ratio. The idolum is in communication with the body and its organs. With Agrippa, however, this system is rather rudi­ mentary. Cf. his De occulta philosophia, III, xlii~ and Auguste Prost, Corneille Agrippa (Paris, 1881), vol. 1,85. 108. Drawn from De Anima, written about 1741 and printed by Tafel under the title Regnum Animale VII (London, 1849).

Indeed, two weeks later we read: \"I held my hands to­ gether. In the act of waking, it seemed to me that they were pressed together by a hand or finger; which, with God's help, signifies that our Lord heard my prayers\" (Journal of Dreams §155). During the night of July 1 or 2, he is overcome by intense tremors \"as when Christ showed me divine grace\"; he awaits \"being thrown upon my face as the previous time.\" At the moment of the final tremor he feels a \"back. I laid hold of the whole back, as well as put my hands under to the breast in front. Straightaway it laid itself down, and I saw in front the countenance also, but this very obscurely.\" This vision is also produced, in his opinion, in a state between dream and wakefulness: \"This was a vision when I was neither waking nor sleeping, for I had all my thoughts together. It was the inward man separated from the outward that knew this.\" He concludes that this time it was the case of an angel because he was not constrained to prostrate himself (Journal of Dreams §209-210). Yet another vision of the same kind, ofJuly 30 or August 1, is weaker. He feels the tremors, has the sensation of being \"thrown on his face,\" but he is not certain of it. A moment later he is \"snatched\" from his vision \"and found under my back one who it seemed was an acquaintance.\" He becomes irri­ tated because this person had \"taken me from it [the vision].\" 151.

Herrlin has pointed (Sydsvenska Dagbladet, 1903, n. 220) to Swedenborg's entry of August 26-27: \"In the night the soles of my feet appeared altogether white, which signifies that my sins have been forgiven.\" He indicates that this relates to the washing of feet of which Brockmer speaks. It is likewise in the entry dated July 22-23 (Journal of Dreams §22): \"I saw a boy running away with my shirt, and set out in pursuit. May mean that I had not washed my feet\" (cf. also Journal of Dreams §91). As to the declaration that Swedenborg would have of­ fered to be the Christ, I have found in the Journal no confirmation other than the enigmatic passage where it is said (Journal of Dreams §276): \"He appeared to me to be Jesus Christ himself, with whom I had a relationship as with anyone else.\" In any case, it was only a matter of a dream here. It seems hardly likely that in this case Swedenborg imagined himself to be the Messiah: his intimate journal would certainly not have failed to make some allusion to this belief. 155.

A reminiscence of Milton might also be assumed in a passage where Sweden­ borg narrates (The Worship and Love oJGod §73) how knowledges transform evil spirits into rampant and hissing serpents in Adam's presence. In Paradise Lost, book 10, 1.508, there is an account in which the demons, similarly trans­ formed into serpents, hiss around their prince.

My conception of the inter­ changes between Sweden borg and spirits by way of verbal pseudohallucina­ tions differs from those of Ballet (121-123), who considers them psychosensory. He bases his view on a quotation from Heaven and Hell that describes the intercommunication between man and spirits as follows (248): \"The language of the angel or spirit is heard in a manner as sonorous as the speech of man to man; but it is heard by him alone and not by others who are present. That is because the language of the angel or spirit flows first into the thought of the man and by an inner way, into his ears and thus activates that organ interiorly, while the speech of man to man first flows over the air and by an external way into his ears, and activates the ear externally. From this it is evident that the speech of the angel and of the spirit with man is heard inside man, and that, because it likewise activates his organ of hearing, it is also heard in a sonorous manner.\" From this Ballet concludes (p. 121) that we are dealing with an auditory psychosensory hallucination. \"These hallucinations, 340"

      "text": "NOTES as one knows, present all the characteristics of auditory perceptions as genuine; the same sonority, same externalization.\" It seems to me, on the contrary, that the above quotation indicates that this language of the spirit was not external­ ized. Had Swedenborg wished to indicate that it had the character of a true au­ ditory perception, he would naturally turn his ear interiorly and not vice versa. Swedenborg does not believe he perceives this language through the ears, since he ultimately makes it \"inflow\" into the auditory organ. This is clear from the passage following the quotation cited by Ballet: \"The fact that the speech of an angel or of a spirit flows from the interior into the ear appeared to me clearly from the fact that this language flows equally into the tongue where it causes a slight vibration, but no movements of the kinds which are produced when the man himself articulates sounds of the speech.\" This phenomenon is mentioned by Ballet several pages further on when citing the conversation of Sweden borg with a spirit from Mars. Ballet considers this to be a mental hallucination (that is to say, according to the theory, a mental representation with a delirious inter­ pretation), accompanied by a motor phenomenon. As it appears to me, the sole difference between the two resides in the fact that, in his conversation with the inhabitant of Mars, Swedenborg does not perceive the tone of voice. It is clearly this \"internal resonance\" of which Seglas speaks that Swedenborg has in view when he declares that the speech of the spirit is just as \"sonorous\" as though it had issued from his tongue and his lips, even though it is not translated by a sound. The \"cognitive language\" which Ballet also considers as a psychic hallu­ cination, differs from the two preceding in that there is no verbal form. Our preceding quotation no doubt accurately refers to this direct transmission of the thought emanating from the spirits. In Arcana Coelestia § 1763, Sweden borg speaks of spirits talking out loud, whose speech resembles the murmur of water or the rolling of thunder. He seemed to perceive, not distinct voices, but the murmur of a whole crowd. Here it seems to be a matter of sonorous hallucinations, even thought of ele­ mentary nature. Sweden borg moreover declares that this type of speech is very rare. 210. Seglas, 308. 211. Case reported by Karl Jaspers, Allgemeine Psychopathologie (Berlin, 1913),40. 212. Kandinsky, 97.

I should take this opportunity to underscore in passing the absurdity of the claim, first expressed by Cornelius and afterward repeated by a number of au­ thors, that the Swedenborgian doctrine of the Trinity recalls that of Zinzen­ dorf. The analogy lies in the importance accorded to Jesus Christ. Based upon my exposition, one might conclude that, quite to the contrary of Zinzendorfs view, Swedenborg has set the historic personality of the Christ in the back­ ground. He particularly opposed the doctrine of vicarious atonement that, for Zinzendorf, is essential for Christianity. 231. That Swedenborg may have been even tempted to reach pantheistic conclu­ sions is clear from his account in Conjugial Love §328 of a conversation with several spirits: \"And I told them that I once considered the omnipotence and ubiquity of God, that is, before the creation, and I conceived, from the anxiety in not being able to discard from my mind ideas of space and time, for nature was substituted for God. But I was told: 'Discard the representations of space and time and you will see.' And it was given to me to eliminate these notions, and I saw. And from that time I could visualize God from all eternity ... \" 232. Stockl, Geschichte der Christlichen Philosoph ie, vol. 2: Zeit der Kirchenviiter, 320 and quotations. 342"

I cannot refrain from pointing out in passing the manifest external analogy be­ tween the triadic system of Proclus and the \"discrete degrees\" of Swedenborg such as they are expounded during his theological period. Proclus, who, like Swedenborg, combined a clearly systematic and visionary temperament with a marked tendency toward scholastic formalism, sought to systematize the ema­ nationist process, by which multiplicity arises from unity, through a triadic scheme. Just as unity creates the multiplicity from its own emanation without undergoing any modification itself, and just as each lower rung of the evolution finds itself, at the same time, separated from the higher rung as well as united with it by a causal relationship, the effect, which finds itself in the cause, sepa­ rates itself from the cause to reunite itself with it. These three stages reproduce themselves at each stage of the evolutionary chain, which passes from perfection to imperfection, the lower rung being unable to receive in itself all the power of the higher one. With Proclus as with Swedenborg, this triadic schema is univer­ sal and is applied equally to the two which, with Proclus, forms a kind of triadic hierarchy. Clearly nothing keeps us from assuming that Swedenborg may have had direct knowledge of the system of Proclus, whose works, like those of other Neoplatonists, were published in Latin during the Renaissance. I have equally attempted to make a comparison with the edition of Patrizzi of the Elementa theologica (Ferrara, 1583), in which Proclus expounds his doctrines in the form of mathematical demonstrations, as Spinoza did later. However, I have not dis­ covered any decisive proof of a direct influence. Since the doctrine of series and degrees is not associated with the triadic schema at the time of its appearance, it appears probable that Swedenborg has reasoned out his system independently ofProclus. The observed analogy can for the most part be explained by the fact that the two authors separate themselves from the emanationist doctrine of Plotinus, where the three stages on which Proclus structures his schema are al­ ready found, although they may not be applied to the various phases of the evo­ lutionary chain.

It cannot be admitted, as Schlieper does (p. 35) after having reviewed the above \"memorable relation,\" that Sweden borg had returned to the dualism of Descartes. In his last work, De Consummatione Saeculi (published in Spiritual Diary vol. 7), he still asserts that what prevents knowledge of the relationship between soul and body resides in the hypotheses \"of Descartes and several oth­ ers that the soul is a substance distinct from the body.\" Swedenborg himself ties his conception of the links between soul and body to the doctrines of clas­ sical antiquity (Ibid., 145.) 246.

Ritschl, op. cit., I, 248ff.) seems to relate Swedenborg's theory on the world of spirits to the interest shown by many Pietists in the intermediate state. He is still forced to recognize that these are determined by quite another motive than that of Swedenborg-the belief in the apocatastasis. It seems to me su­ perfluous to research Sweden borg's sources for the topography of the spiritual world. In its broad lines, it reproduces the notions of Christianity, which may be attached to the Bible, and can be found, in one form or another, in various writers. Plato's exposition of the other world (Republic 10, 614) is itself based on the same topography. 261. This short work is found in Swedenborg's Posthumous Theological Works, 2nd ed. (West Chester, Penna.: Swedenborg Foundation, 1996. See also Tafel, Spir­ itual Diary (London, 1846), vol. 7, §88. 262. Swedenborg declares that he found this place indicated in Ezekiel 32:18. 263. This description probably has nothing to do with the famous description given by Plato (Republic vol. 7, 515) of the subterranean cave: it is more likely a development of the fundamental idea found in the Gospel of John, which says, \"And this is the judgment, that the light has come into the world, and men have loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil\" (John 3:19). Swedenborg constantly quotes this passage with regard to the men who pronounce their own condemnation. 264. Tafel, vol. 1, document 5 (Robsahm's memoirs), 50. 265. In the Spiritual Diary §4729, Maria Polhem is described as vain and worldly. \"Her principal preoccupation in social circles is her appearance and cooking.\" 266.

Tafel's only argument that could be discussed seriously is that Swedenborg visited Italy for the first time at the age of fifty. But the ex­ pression \"in my youth\" could be a mistranslation of \"when I was younger\" (in effect we only have the account of Tuxen in the English translation made by Nordenskold) or a misstatement by Swedenborg, who at the time of the inter­ view, was eighty-two years old. He could thus well have erred regarding the time of his voyage to Italy. 271. Sundelin, Luthers Etik (Ups. Univ. Arsskrift, 1880),43-46. 272. This concept goes back to his scientific period and is a consequence of his the­ ory of series and degrees. In the Journal of Dreams he maintains in effect that 345"
