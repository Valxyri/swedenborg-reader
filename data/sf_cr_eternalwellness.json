But when working in the spiritual realm, one must accommodate a seventh direction—going within. Eternal Wellness: The Importance of Healing, Connecting, Community, and the Inner Journey searches for the source of spiritual well-being following interior passageways thatmay at times defy logic, a map that includes heart and feeling. Through essays, stories, poetry, and art, Eternal Wellness explores a variety of approaches to being spiritually centered, in alignmentwith the universe at large, in harmony with life, and in touch withour understanding of the spirit or life-force that flowsthrough it all.

Y et for someone else,it may mean moving mindfully alone among the massive sandstoneoutcrops of the Canyonlands. A myriad of practices point to spiritual well-being and enlight- enment, but which practices are for us, which ones to trust? Is it pos-sible that one size fits all? Eternal Wellness examines the dynamic of spiritual balance, asking what constitutes a healthy diet of spiritualnourishment. Can one overdose on too much of a good thing? Ifthere are teachable moments, how do we make the most of these mo-ments? In one author’s account, we travel with an older priest as herides in an ambulance to Ground Zero. Trying to maintain his con-nectedness—integrating love, self-doubt, and duty in his work withfiremen and paramedics struggling around him—he questions,When you feel ill in spirit, how do you seek healing? Who serves as yourspiritual doctor? For those who persevere, Eternal Wellness suggests that the an- swer will come from inside. In my case, as I have been dealing withbladder cancer while working on this issue, guidance has come indreams. During my first hospitalization, I dreamed that I dove fromthe prow of a hospital ship. As I swam in the ocean, a school of dol-phins overwhelmed me. I was frightened, seeing their open mouthsand teeth. They simply engulfed me, and the king of the dolphinssaid that he had adopted me, that I was the prince of dolphins.T ogether we pressed on, inhaling, churning the ocean white, attack-ing the cancer, expelling the toxins. In the end, perhaps there is no right path, no prescribed route through pleasant valleys and pristine mountains. Instead, one mightjust as likely find devastated fields and rugged chasms—with noguardrails. We must discover for ourselves which spiritual practices,which guideposts, speak to us and, with heightened senses on alert,knowing there are tantalizing possibilities waiting for us within, fol-low with courage and trust in our heart. Spiritual Compass Opposite: David Wynne.

Dry and in a deplorable state of disrepair, it looked as forlorn as the dunes in the moonlight. One day a solitary traveler, a pilgrim carry-ing only a small bundle and a walking staff, stopped at the little well to rest. \"The pilgrim must be lost,\" thought the well, “for no one ever comes out here anymore. Soon this one will leave, for only a foolwould stay, knowing my well is dry.” But the pilgrim stayed.The little well had been nearly swallowed by the desert after many years of neglect. The pilgrim unpacked the small bundle andstarted to clean the sand and dust from around the base of the well.Smoothing the ground with bare hands, the pilgrim removed somany pebbles and stones from around the well that a low wall wasbuilt, protecting the little well from the sudden siroccos and keepingthe constantly shifting desert sands at bay. The pilgrim then replacedthe frayed rope, patched the holes in the leaky bucket, and oiled and polished the rusty crank. Though the pilgrim's supplies were meager, there was nothing that was spared in bringing the little wellback to life. Taking some seeds from the bundle, the pilgrim plantedthem around the well in what remained of the sandy, sun-bleachedgrass. In no time—though it could have been days or weeks—the once-abandoned oasis sparkled and shone in the sun. A flag fash-ioned from the pilgrim's colorful scarf flapped proudly in the breeze.Anyone who came to the farthest oasis now and saw the little wellglinting in the sun and its colorful flag flapping in the breeze wouldthink that it was one of the most beautiful in the entire desert.

And then, so moved by all that the patient pilgrim had done for it and saddenedby the thought that the pilgrim would soon leave, the well began tocry. The tears that had been held back for so long began as a trickle, and then a fountain, bubbling deep within the dark depths of thewell. For what seemed like forever—though it could have been onlyminutes or hours—the little well cried. A puddle became a stream,and the stream became a spring as the tears of thankfulness and sad-ness poured out of the little well. Soon, there was the sound of gur-gling and the splashing of water from deep within the well. The pilgrim, who had been tending the dying plants with the last drops of water from a nearly empty water pouch, ran anxiously tothe edge of the well and listened. A smile split the pilgrim’s dusty,sunburned face. The bucket was lowered into the well, and time andtime again, it came back drippingly full of sparkling, pure water. Thepilgrim drank and drank of the cool, clear water and then, breakinginto song, danced around and around the little well, watering thethirsty plants. In no time at all—although it could have been months or years—the last oasis turned green and lush with the trees and flowers planted by the pilgrim. From these came a bountiful harvestof fruits and vegetables, of plums, figs, dates, olives, coconuts, andpomegranates. From that time forward—every minute of every hour of every day of every year—there was so much happiness at the farthest oa-sis that the little well stopped crying tears of sadness and cried for-ever tears of joy.  . , from Grand Rapids, Michigan, and a graduate of Aquinas College, has been published in the Catholic Digest, Liquorian, and Public Libraries, as well as in numerous local publications.“Writing is a pas- sion.

The train in Dickinson’s verse was the great symbol of technological progress inher time. She catches our fascination with the image. At first we arecaught up in childlike enthusiasm for trains or with the image of thejourney evoked, and we don’t notice such words as “supercilious,”“complaining,” or “horrid—hooting stanza.” Dickinson’s moderneditor, Thomas Johnson, calls this poem a “biting satire on progress.” The poem leaves us with the tensions of “docile and omnipo- tent.” Is the train (or the computer or nuclear power) godlike in itspower yet docile to our commands? Is Dickinson referring to man,machine, or God? Some people tend to identify technology as the source of a num- ber of our civilization’s problems while simultaneously enjoying andeven demanding its benefits. Is the overemphasis on technology to-day leading to an unawareness of our spiritual selves? We have a de-pendency, not chemical, but a technological dependency. Every timewe look at a watch and derive comfort from knowing the time, weget a technological fix. And there’s the car, the TV, the CDand DVD , the computer and internet. With digital music and videos, we haveadded the symbol of digitization to our cultural enjoyments, ournumerical fix with statistics and surveys. The world has become aclockwork mechanism. But this only presents one side of technology. The compact disc can bring music into our lives with the power of a divine majesty.The CDcan serve the spirit and thus serve meaning. The key to the effect or outcome of technology in our lives is not in the technologyas such, but in our ability to choose how to use that technology andhow we deal with its opposing consequences. I believe that our principal means of psychological and spiritual growth lies in struggling with the tension of values. Such tension is anessential ingredient for finding spiritual well-being. If we are to growand evolve as a species capable of caring for the planet entrusted tous, then we must recognize these opposing values and choose to re-spond with our own solutions, made visible in how we live. As we findthe balance between what is practical and what is spiritual, we cancenter ourselves for choosing what action to undertake. Daily life is full of paradoxes.We try to detoxify the environment, yet we fail to recognize our internal poisons. We identify with thehighest human ideals and aspirations, forgetting that we humans arealso egocentric and brutal. Without potentials for both good andevil, we would be moral automata, and our claim to be carriers or ac-tuators of values of any sort would be meaningless. But we are notautomata. There certainly is a higher power which helps us to desireand act for good and for love. John L. Hitchcock1Wellness.qxd 7/19/03 5:26 PM Page 8"

      "text": "Once we accept the deep need for values in tension as a means of moving forward in the evolutionary process, it is then necessary to discover how to handle that tension nonexplosively, even in a veryliteral sense. We need to look newly toward the wholeness of reality;wholeness is precisely the holding or honoring of both values thatcome to tension in any given situation: individual versus social, selfversus the other, masculine versus feminine, global versus local, etc.         is that all op- posites are tied together, including moral light and darkness. Perfection, usually identified as separating out and cutting off alldarkness from the remaining light, is therefore impossible. We are generally unaware of our own inner darkness. We like to think of ourselves as relatively harmless. Although we often feel thatothers are unaware of their shortcomings, we fail to apply this logicas insight into our own blindness about ourselves. Psychologically,the process of seeing one’s own faults as some other person’s faultsis called “projection.” We project onto others not only our faults, butalso our own potentials for greatness. This positive potential is alsopart of our shadow, a part of ourselves that we fear to face. Thus, the shadow contains both our darkest and brightest sides. We get emotionally involved with figures of darkness in relation toworld events, from Hitler to Osama bin Laden to Saddam Hussein,and want to rid the world of them. But each of us also has a desire tovarying degrees to control others or a devotion to a rigid and narrowspiritual outlook. This is a centrally important principle with whichto examine our lives. Ask yourself what are your strongest fascina-tions, both as attractions and as repulsions. What stirs your emo-tions? Whom do you envy? Whom would you like to remove fromthe face of the earth? If you make a list of such images, you can gaininsight into your own character. We also avoid facing our possibilities for greatness, which are of- ten alarming to us. If we have plenty of money or a good job with se-curity, it won’t matter as much if we’ve not lived our potential. Weknow this is true, for we are attracted to reports on the rich and fa-mous, quite apart from their moral characteristics. Without darkness, freedom and self-awareness are impossible. We repress the consciousness of our inner darkness simply becausewe fear to face that part of ourselves. Sometimes it is a toss-up as towhether we fear more our “sinfulness” or our potential greatness.Either fear will keep us from awareness of inner moral conflicts orvalues in tension. But avoidance of the dark is also avoidance of thelight, truth, wisdom, and the conscious relationship to inner powers Values in Tension1Wellness.qxd 7/19/03 5:26 PM Page 9"

Cultural history has aided our self-deception. By teaching the “split,” the “sheep-and-goats,” or “wheat-and-chaff” view of hu-mans. We have also perpetuated our self-deception by devising a sys-tem of punishments or of scapegoating (letting or forcing someoneelse to be the “dark being”). The tension contained in our darknessalso can be relieved with scheduled release, as with Mardi Gras. Weeagerly anticipate such times, knowing the feeling of really beingalive that comes with them. If we really knew our dark sides, wemight feel alive much more of the time. We have been taught to strive for perfection by getting rid of our dark impulses. The Greek word teleios, which is used when Jesus is reported to have said, “Be therefore perfect, as your heavenly Fatheris perfect,” is much better translated, “Be therefore complete, orwhole,” i.e., having no parts missing or including everything in yourlife which enters it. Indeed, this passage amplifies the point, as it says,“for [God] makes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sendshis rain on the just and on the unjust.” This great image of agricul-tural beneficence, which Jesus encourages us to emulate, should in-spire us to find some way to be inclusive of our own darkness for thebenefit in consciousness that it affords us. Under any current ethic, we are all flawed in our living, causing feelings of guilt. Psychologists know that many children suffer fromfeeling that they “deserve”punishment that has yet to be visited uponthem. T endencies to undervalue ourselves are likely rooted in whatwe feel as unpunished guilt, carried from childhood into adulthood.Our “guilt” remains unreleased. We continually attempt to revitalize the ancient Hebrew rite of scapegoating, prescribed as a ritual in Leviticus 16:20–21. In this rit-ual, the priest formally heaped the sins of the congregation upon theselected goat, which was then driven into the wilderness. For this rit-ual to work, people had to believe that the heaping of their sins wasaccomplished, requiring a naiveté that a modern education makesdifficult if not impossible. Even in recent times, the punishment ofcriminals has enabled many people outside prisons to feel clean byprojecting their own darkness onto those in prison. But it is ourdarkness that distorts our perception of our inner moral state. T echnology has also been a scapegoat, but the heaping of blame upon technology or upon political or economic systems hasn’tworked, because it simply isn’t true. We not only get what we deservein the outer world—we get what we want. What will enable us to seeand to admit this fact? If technology seems to us to engender a dis- John L.

We believe we want relationship with others and the world, but fearof the shadow prevents us from treading the necessary path. Einstein is reported to have said: “We shall require a substantial- ly new manner of thinking if mankind is to survive.” I believe thatthis is to be found in “polar-inclusive” thinking (including polar op-posites as equally valid in thinking about an issue). This thinking isbased on “complementarity” as the great contribution of the newphysics. As in the preceding example, darkness and light are both es-sential components of aliveness. In physics, complementarity has survived rigorous scrutiny to become established as the new way of apprehending physical realityin its deepest manifestations. The idea of is that there are funda-mental situations in which it is absolutely necessary to use contra-dictory concepts to achieve a complete or whole description of enti-ties or phenomena. In these situations, the opposites cannot be sep-arated because they apply to the same thing. This indicates that theopposites in general are subject to a higher unity; our own light anddark moral aspects are ultimately inseparable. Although the shadow holds our inner darkness and collects our faults, it also contains our new life. Fear of our own shadow that hasled us, individually and collectively, to the rigidities of our currentpsychic structure with its emotional defenses. This psychic energybuilds to a bursting point because conflicting facts accumulate con-cerning our ideals that contrast with our actual behavior. By recognizing our own darkness and withholding the projec- tion of darkness onto others, we will automatically reduce conflict.In Neumann’s terms, we become “non-infectious.”* The benefit toourselves is that we achieve a greater wholeness. We cannot deal with our inner darkness purely intellectually. Emotions are involved, and thus we are on dangerous ground. Wehave a barrier layer of feeling, which prevents clear sight of facts un-til sufficient experience has been acquired or until we have run outof facile answers. If we are called to this kind of introspective work,sooner or later our inner contradictions make themselves known.T o permit the inner tension that accompanies self-awareness is to be-come open to the very forces that drive our creativity. I have tried to say as clearly as I could what changes we need to attempt in order to face our fears and guilt and thus have some realchance of hearing the creative Voice within.

And there he came to a cave, and lodged there; and behold, the word of the LORD came to him, and he said to him, “What are you doing here, Elijah?” He said,“I have been very jealous for theLord, the God of hosts; for the people of Israel have forsakenyour covenant, thrown down your altars, and slain yourprophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left and they seekmy life to take it away.” And he said, “Go forth, and stand uponthe mount.” . . . And behold, the Lord passed by, and a great andstrong wind rent the mountains, and broke in pieces the rocks ...b u t the Lord was not in the wind; and after the wind an earth- quake, but the Lord was not in the earthquake; and after theearthquake a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire; and after thefire a still small voice. And when Elijah heard it, he wrapped hisface in his mantle. If such aloneness and divine charge were upon that prophet, why not upon any of us as well? After that powerful experience, God just sent him back to carry on his work. Before us passes a scene such aswe can resonate with: it is as if our very life is sought by the powersof disintegration, and there is the tremendous clamor of windsbreaking rocks, of earthquake and fire; all those tumultuous hap-penings, which may seem to us as divine judgments, even upon our-selves.

Currently, a skeleton of anovel hangs in my mind, with two chapters fleshed out, and there’sat least one more nonfiction book that’s beginning to take shape. At the same time I was testing the freelance waters, my athletic mate began to coax me outdoors. I learned to ski, then took up jog-ging. It was fun shushing down a steep slope with my husband, whoinsisted he did not find me uncoordinated at all, even though ini-tially it took me days to learn to board a chairlift. During warmerweather, I found it exhilarating to enter 10K races, knowing each en-trant was struggling with his or her own challenges and not at all in-terested in critiquing my style of running or lack thereof. But deepinside, I remained an awkward little girl. My main criterion for feeling safe in this world revolved around remaining invisible. When a staid friend admitted she fantasizedabout being a stripper, I stood with my mouth agape. I could never,ever, I thought, be comfortable in any kind of spotlight. Signingbooks at a bookstore was different. My work, much more than I, wason display. Although something I wrote might be criticized, I couldalmost certainly avoid being clumsy on paper. In 1990, a set of puzzling physical symptoms appeared that frightened me, not just because they might be early symptoms ofsome grave disease, but because they were impossible to hide.

Before I’d had a chance to tell her about my condition, my edi- tor at Conari Press approached me to write a book about facing fear.I had no idea why this editor thought I could tackle this particulartopic. But with a psychologist and friend, I began work interviewingpeople, conducting research, and drawing on my own experiences asI faced fears I could never have imagined confronting. The Little Book of Courage is comprised of two-page meditative essays. In the process of writing about how we all can face and feel our fears, then eithertranscend or transform them, I finally dared look at what had be-come a phobic fear about remaining invisible. Although Parkinson’s assorted symptoms vary with each indi- vidual, over a period of years, the illness becomes “noticeable.” Forinstance, before my diagnosis and a subsequent regimen of drugsthat began to alleviate symptoms greatly, I was barely able to sign acheck. My writing had become so small and shaky that I could nolonger handwrite a letter or pen notes during a lecture. At the su-permarket, or any place I planned to make a purchase, I made sure Ihad enough cash and always put the bills in the top of my purse, soI could grasp them without difficulty. If I got change back, I dumpedit into my purse, so as not to attract attention to my fumbling fin-gers. If I needed a new pair of shoes, I shopped at the time of daywhen I was least fatigued—I didn’t want a clerk clucking sympa-thetically as I struggled with the simple act of pushing my left footinto a shoe. Once, in the mid-nineties, when I took an emergency flight to Atlanta to see my sick mother, I bristled when a well-meaning ticketagent asked if I might like to ride down the concourse in a wheel-chair. I mumbled something about having gotten this far all by my-self and turned away quickly to hide tears of embarrassment andfrustration. Almost two years ago, my medications, though still effective enough to keep me moving and functioning, began to cause dyski-nesia—random involuntary jerky movements. So, while medica-tions may continue to alleviate Parkinson’s symptoms, they often be-gin to unleash their own St. Vitus dance. Mixed in with this hyper-activity, there often are “off” times when the medication has wornoff and movement is laborious or impossible. Human beings appear to be the most accomplished of the species when it comes to worrying about “how we appear.” Since theonset of Parkinson’s, I’ve spent lots of energy trying to concoct waysto keep looking good and not be deemed “ill” or “awkward.” But howcould I keep this swirling, tyrannical fear from shattering tranquili-ty and stirring anxiety?  Sarah Quigley1Wellness.qxd 7/19/03 5:27 PM Page 14"

Several years ago, I recalled a life-defining incident—a backyard scene with my father. One afternoon, tagging along after him—I must have been four—I got tangled up in my own two feet andcrashed to the ground. I imagine I expected to be scooped up andcomforted, but any such hope vanished when he mumbled, “Y ou’rethe big-footedest little girl I’ve ever seen.”His words stung more thanmy skinned knees. I remembered wiping blood off my knees, tryingto restore my aplomb, as tears began streaking my dirty cheeks. Butthis time, I felt something entirely different from embarrassment.There was a flash of anger. Why, Father, couldn’t you focus on me for just a moment—talk to me, hug me, acknowledge me?

The dyskinesias werereally bad that day, but I stood at the podium, reading words I hopedmight inspire a few who had come.

I felt like a windup toy that was rapidly unwinding. Carefully, I crossed the wide boulevard, walked into a MacDonald’s, and ordered a “senior” coffee, ice water, and an eggMacMuffin. By the time I dragged myself to a booth, I felt a millionyears old. With effort, I pulled my medication dispenser from myjean’s pocket, popped a little compartment open, and swallowed twopills. Then I sat waiting for their effects. Every so often a dose fails towork. I sat in the booth a full twenty minutes, hoping I could walkthe mile back to our condominium. My contingency plans were tocall a cab. I had enough cash in my pocket. I won’t lie. This incident scared me. But this time the fear led to practical solutions—I had only to figure out what to do and not be-come sidetracked, wondering what anybody else might be thinkingabout a rather stone-like figure of a woman sitting in a booth, lettingher food get cold. The medicine kicked in. I wolfed down my break-fast and not only walked back, but also stopped in Wal-Mart to pickup a few groceries.

Who can we blame if not ourselves?” “Who indeed?” offered the infant.“Y es, who but ourselves? How else are we to know our lives mat- ter? Sin is the price we pay for our free will, for being conscious, forbeing human and not a pile of stones. Thousands of bacteria dieevery time I brush my teeth. Without sin, how can we be any morethan they?” “If we aren’t,” said the child, “how much greater our need for each other?” The old priest huffed. He ground the heels of his hands into his eyes. Stars swam in his vision. “Listen to me,” the infant said.“I remember when you held your water above me like Abraham’s dagger. If you hadn’t held me, I wouldhave fallen to the floor. If no one had fed me, I would have starved.If no one had bathed me, I would have rotted in my own filth.Abraham saw all these things when he looked down at his son. Thatis why he put away his knife.

I received a shocking wake-up call that nearly put an end to mymedical career before it started. Deservedly famous for its state-of-the-art research facilities in genetics, the laboratory derived the bulkof its income from breeding and exporting pure strains of mice, rats,dogs, cats, monkeys, rabbits, and other species for biomedical exper-imentation all over the world. From the number of animals sacrificedin my own work and the regular quotas of my colleagues, to the vastquantities we supplied to others for similar purposes, I quicklygrasped the enormity of this ghastly enterprise and of my own unde-niable complicity in it. Since then, no quality or quantity of reason-ing has ever persuaded me that human progress requires the system-atic torture and killing of helpless creatures, or that valid standards ofethics or science could ever be built on such foundations. Upon entering medical school, these misgivings only intensified with the years, such that I continued to doubt my vocation at everystep.

After days or weeks of experimentation on veins often weak orcompromised to begin with, our last resort was the dreaded femoralpuncture, which took only a few seconds but left both perpetratorand victim holding our breaths until the huge syringe was filled atlast. On the medical wards, we were chiefly responsible for admitting all lobar pneumonia patients, typically alcoholics fromSkid Row, for whom a high fever, productive cough,pleuritic pain, or some equally serious ailment was theonly ticket to a warm bed and regular food on coldwinter nights. In most cases, the sputum was loadedwith Streptococcus pneumoniae, an organism still read- ily curable with penicillin in those days; but before be-ginning the treatment, we were expected to inoculate the specimeninto the peritoneal cavity of two mice, yielding the bacteria in pureculture when we sacrificed them two days later. Since the test waslargely academic, I only pretended to do it, never raising the issue ofanimal testing but unwilling to inflict or witness the torture myself. One of my favorite assignments was night call on the maternity service, where the miracle of birth sometimes occurred in the weehours before anybody had a chance to step in and do anything aboutit. Listening to the women in labor from my cot in the next room, Ioften reflected on the word “obstetrician,” derived from the Latin ob, meaning “against” or “in the way of,” and stet, literally “stand” or “standing,” all too well suited to physicians trained to stand in theway of the birth process in order to appropriate and control it forpurposes of their own. It required years of inner work for me to realize that the culture of entitlement that gives physicians and medical students carte blanche to do as we see fit and compels our patients to obey and even thank us for it culminates in the actual propagation of disease, bothindirectly, by spreading fear and doubt, and directly, through overuseof diagnostic and treatment procedures with obvious power toharm. During my student years, a pediatrician renowned for his work in the field of infectious diseases succeeded in proving what manyhad long suspected, that the virus known as Hepatitis A is transmit-ted orally by ingestion of contaminated feces. This knowledge wasgained by conducting dangerous experiments on individuals with-out their consent, namely, retarded children at a state school whocould not speak for themselves and often lacked parents or guardiansto speak for them. Housecalls On rare occasions when the beds were empty and the wards deserted, I couldalmost smell the faint but ineradicablemiasma haunting the place, like theaccumulated residuum of all diseasespast and present.1Wellness.qxd 7/19/03 5:27 PM Page 29"

After taking my degree, I obtained a graduate fel-lowship in philosophy, mainly to clarify and even resolve the com-plicated dilemmas I had just witnessed and lived through. Well be-fore I found words to articulate or concepts to explain it, I knew ona gut level that reducing diseases to abnormalities and using drugsand surgery to try to separate and ultimately remove them from thepatient incurred serious ethical and practical risks that I could notaccept on a routine basis. Three years later, I tried again, serving a one-year internship at a large general hospital with three-month rotations in medicine and surgery, and two-month assignments in pediatrics,women’s health, and emergency medicine. Our in-structors were the attending physicians using the hos-pital to care for their private patients, on whose behalfwe might be asked to provide an admission workup, in-sert an IV, assist in surgery, or whatever else they or the nurses might require. In addition, indigent patients re-ferred from the ERand outpatient clinics, which we staffed and ran, were assigned to our care under the su-pervision of our preceptor for that service. In short, weused the old apprenticeship model, which groundedme splendidly in how medicine was actually practiced,allowed me to learn at my own pace, and left plenty ofroom for close personal relationships with preceptors,nurses, and patients alike. One memorable experience grew out of my friendship with a pa- tient in his forties. In time we became friends, and he invited me tohis home in the projects to meet his wife, savor her famous enchi-ladas, and stay the night. At about 2 AM, he woke me from a sound sleep with some urgency to ask if I’d see his aged father, who wascomplaining of severe chest pain in his home across the courtyard.As I entered his room, the old man was sitting up in bed, leaning for-ward with his hands clasped over his heart and a look of mortal ter-ror in his eyes, a textbook picture of acute coronary occlusion. Though equipped with only my black bag and reluctant to treat him at home, I dreaded even more having to subject him to the alien,military atmosphere of the ERand the Coronary Care Unit, where the risk of a serious complication suddenly seemed even greater. Lessthan ten minutes after a shot of morphine, he fell into a deep andpeaceful sleep, and by morning he was feeling much better and rest-ing comfortably. When I left for work, his wife told me that he hadrecovered from at least three such episodes in the past without any Richard Moskowitz As in most hospitals, the bulk of our in- struction came from the nurses, whobasically ran the place but knew how tomake it look as if they were followingour orders instead of the other wayaround.

After finishing my internship and obtaining my license, I began seeing patients in my home, in order to make my practice more open,informal, and based on consensus rather than authority. My methodwas simply to examine patients as noninvasively as I could, usingonly the simplest tools and as much direct participation as the situ-ation allowed, making the diagnosis, to be sure, but leaving plenty oftime and space for their own individuality and experience to suggesta regimen and plan of treatment more uniquely suited to them. At this point, I was practicing what might be called “minimalist” medicine, giving liberal helpings of education and advice while do-ing as little as possible of a drastic nature, trying to guide peoplethrough the medical system without their being hurt too badly. Butwith so few procedures available that did no harm or that I couldwholeheartedly support, apart from acute or emergency situations,I had little to offer my patients when their illnesses worsened.   , another experience profoundly changed my life. Over eight months pregnant, with her labor due in a matter of weeks, a woman I knew very slightly called to ask if I’d help her with a homebirth, a seemingly crackpot idea at the time, which none of the doc-tors she had seen would even listen to, let alone cooperate with.While keenly aware of my own insecurity without nurses, colleagues,or modern equipment, I eagerly grasped at the chance she was of-fering me: a way I could function as a physician without risking harmto people or telling them how to live. When Dorothy went into labor, I arrived at her house expecting to perform a vaginal examination straight away, to see how the laborwas progressing. I can’t say if it was the candlelight or the Bach play-ing softly or simply the rapt expressions on the faces of her familyand friends, but somehow I got the message that the exam was some-thing I’d been taught I should do, not anything that she herself real-ly needed or was asking for at that juncture. I decided that if any-thing went wrong, I could trust myself to learn whatever I needed toknow at the time, and that the best thing I could do right then wasjust sit down, be quiet, and pay attention like everyone else. I still don’t know how Dorothy herself knew what she knew, hav- ing given birth to her first child under general anesthesia, but shetaught me the whole course that day, pretty much without saying aword. When her son was born, both mother and child were bathedin a soft halo of light, like a Madonna of Raphael or Filippo Lippi,and we all saw it and stared at her and the baby and each other, as Housecalls1Wellness.qxd 7/19/03 5:27 PM Page 31"

As if trying to give form and shape to the awe and reverence we all felt, hernine-year-old daughter announced she was taking the placenta toschool, wrapped it in a plastic bag and stuffed it under her coat, likea conspirator carrying an oversized bomb. However imperfect my attempts to live up to it, that first home birth showed me a way to function as a physician and healer that stillworks and makes sense for me. Even the most enlightened hospitalhas to make rules for people, to act on their behalf, as if it knows whatis best for them and their babies, while as a midwife I was only a guestin Dorothy’s home, undertaking to follow her rules. My job was thusno longer to do anything in particular or to tell her how to give birth,but simply to be there for her in whatever way seemed most usefulat the time. But the memory of that birth and all that it meant seemed at first no more than a private treasure, a model for self-transformation insome general sense. I had no inkling that anybody else would chooseto give birth in this fashion. It wasn’t until about a year later, whileliving in a cabin in the mountains, that I was suddenly inundatedwith calls for help from women planning home births, and soon Ibecame as busy as I could be, attending forty or so births by the fol-lowing spring and about a hundred and fifty in the three years I livedthere, long enough to watch Dorothy’s wacky idea catch on andspread like a prairie fire through the subculture. Without an office, nurse, appointments, or even a telephone at first, I was totally available to my patients if they could find me, anarrangement that undoubtedly weeded out more than a few, butsuited me quite well and resonated with the frontier spirit of theplace and the already flourishing grapevine of the time. It workedboth ways. On the one hand, prospective patients needed to be re-sponsible for finding out where I was at all times and for masteringthe rudiments of emergency childbirth in case I didn’t make it. Formy own part, I soon learned the advantages of dropping in on themwhenever I came to town, noting that something fun or interestingwas likely to happen when I got there, such as finding the woman al-ready in labor or simply being treated like an honorary member ofthe family for a while, not to mention the reward of a hot meal, pleas-ant company, and a warm bed for the night. In any case, I never missed a birth, lost a baby, or had to take any- one to the hospital in those days, a record that I can’t explain and cer-tainly never equalled in later years when I opened an office, hirednurses and receptionists, hospitalized people when I had to, and hadmy full share of complications like everyone else.

Between 1970 and 1982, I assisted at over six-hundred home births, and the model of the doctor–patient relationship thatemerged from them is as relevant today in my office practice as it wasthen in the field. Through its gentle, family-centered atmosphere,home birth also left ample space for self-healing and helped me in-vestigate subtler and less aggressive modes of treatment in my med-ical practice. With my background in biochemistry and pharmacol-ogy, I naturally gravitated to the study of botanical remedies,combed through herbals, learned to identify many local species,made infusions, poultices, ointments, and suppositories, and gradu-ally began to try them on myself and my patients. My chief mentor was an old German woman who had emigrat- ed after the war, owned a popular health food store in town, and hada large and devoted following of young and old alike. Representinga broad cross-section of ailments, the customers she knew and trust-ed would follow her into the back room, where she used a pendulumboth for diagnosis and to select appropriate vitamins, herbs, supple-ments, and homeopathic remedies. At times, she sent saliva samplesto an even more aged colleague for some sort of esoteric laboratoryreading in which she had confidence that various parasites, toxicwastes, and other pathological residues could be identified radioni-cally. Although many of her procedures seemed like hocus-pocus to me, she introduced me to the vast realm of esoteric phenomena thatintuitively I knew existed but had never directly experienced. She wasalso one of the finest spiritual healers I have ever known. Severalmonths after giving birth, one of my patients called late at night withsevere abdominal pain that had developed with alarming sudden-ness after a long trip to her in-laws to show off the baby. The pelvicexam revealed a taut, bulging mass about the size of a tennis ball inthe area of her right ovary that felt ready to burst, such that even Iwas anxious to take her to surgery without further delay. As a last resort, she begged me to call the old woman, who re- luctantly agreed to come. On entering the room, she knelt down tothe left of the patient and began to pray, placing the fingers of her lefthand over the cyst and allowing her right arm to dangle free by herside. In a minute or so, her whole body shook convulsively, and Icould almost “see” a current of energy passing from her left handacross her body, down her right arm, and out through her free hand.Proceeding to the other side of the bed, she placed her right indexand third fingers on the right side of the pubic bone, a “pressure Housecalls1Wellness.qxd 7/19/03 5:27 PM Page 33"

As soon as she left, I examined my patient again and found that both the pain and the cyst had completely disappeared, and they nev-er came back during the two years that I kept track of her before leav-ing the area. In all my years of practice, I have never witnessed an-other instant cure of serious organic pathology to rival this one, andit convinced me that healing is always possible, even when we leastexpect it or know what form it will take.       led me to home- opathy, my next great spiritual adventure. In 1974, thinking to give Apis, a remedy made from honeybee venom, to a patient who was hypersensitive to bee stings and failing to make any sense out of anold text I’d come across, I wrote to a homeopathic physician backEast, asking if this would be an appropriate prescription.“Well, son-ny boy,” he replied in economical Vermontese, “you’d better come toour summer school!” Neither the sleepy state college campus where the course was giv- en nor the rumpled clothes and advanced age of the homeopathswho taught it augured well for the future of the profession. Most ofthe faculty were old or semi-retired, and very few earned their livingfrom practicing what they were teaching us. It seemed as though thewhole generation of active, successful, experienced practitionerswho should have carried the principal teaching load were missing.No less upsetting was the fact that the course lasted only two weeks,after which we were simply turned loose to practice what we hadlearned on our patients.With no established schools or teaching hos-pitals to its name and few retail pharmacies to send patients to,American homeopathy seemed headed rapidly for oblivion. Y et from the beginning of that course, I knew that homeopathy was just what I’d been looking for, and that I could happily devotethe remainder of my professional life to studying and practicing it.Long before I had given or taken remedies or seen them work on any-one, it made sense to me as both a philosophy, a coherent body ofthought whose basic assumptions ring true, and a detailed, system-atic methodology that followed from them. Indeed, it taught me howto do what I was already doing, making a diagnosis but allowing theindividuality of the patient to guide me to the most appropriatetreatment.

As to whether it works, I offer my entire subsequent career as ev- idence that it does, having used it more or less exclusively in generalpractice for close to three decades with never a cause for regret.Without needing to write prescriptions or refer patients for surgeryexcept as a last resort, I have seen remedies work beautifully in everyphase of pregnancy and childbirth, and in many other acute andthreatening situations, as well as save life, ease the pain of death, andgive dramatic, long-lasting relief in situations where conventionalmethods had failed or seemed totally inapplicable. Two examplescome immediately to mind. A twenty-year-old woman, pregnant for the first time, gave birth to a daughter after a prolonged and difficult expulsion. Though well-formed and weighing over eight pounds, the baby was covered withthick green meconium, took one gasp, and breathed no more.Suctioning the nose and mouth produced only more of the samesticky mess, and by the time I’d tried and failed to intubate or evenvisualize the trachea, she lay limp, pale, and motionless, with a heart-beat of 40 per minute, responding feebly to mouth-to-mouth resus-citation, but unable to breathe on her own. I put a tiny, dilute pow-der of Arsenicum album on her tongue, and she awoke with a jolt, crying and flailing, her heart beating vigorously at 140 per minute,her skin glowing pink with the flame of new life. The whole evolu-tion took at most a few seconds. After a night in the hospital to be onthe safe side, she went home the next morning with no further prob-lems and no indication that anything untoward had happened. A thirty-four-year-old registered nurse had suffered from en- dometriosis since her late teens. Already a veteran of four surgeriesto remove large blood-filled cysts from her bladder and pelvic or-gans, as well as several courses of male hormones to suppress thecondition, she came seeking only to restore her menstrual cycle, hav-ing long since abandoned any hope of childbearing. Although quitepainful in the past, her periods had long since become scanty,“dead,”and dark-brown as a result of so many operations and years of hor-mones and oral contraceptives. In the course of the treatment, hermenstrual flow became fuller and richer, and within six months shewas pregnant. I next saw her for a different ailment eight years later:she had had two healthy children after normal pregnancies and un-complicated vaginal births, and had been well since. I am deeply grateful that homeopathic remedies are available without prescription, and that the knowledge of how to use them isreadily accessible to everyone with or without professional training. Housecalls1Wellness.qxd 7/19/03 5:27 PM Page 35"

Since 1974, I have practiced homeopathy more or less exclusive- ly and according to the classical method, using only one remedy at atime for the whole patient, and preferring the higher dilutions if Ican see the remedy clearly. If I cannot help patients with remediesand conventional treatment seems indicated, I refer them to some-body else. If practiced conscientiously, the method poses minimalrisk of harm and allows me to learn and grow at my own pace. On the other hand, I do not believe and have never taught that it is the only way to heal people or the best way for everyone. Far frombeing a panacea for all ills, homeopathy has major limitations of itsown, some of them inherent and others that will have to be judgedin the light of a new bioenergetic science that is still in its infancy. Ichoose to practice it because it is the method best suited to my ownparticular evolution and style. Moreover, even when it is better un-derstood, I doubt that it will ever become the dominant mode of sci-entific treatment for this or any other society.

There has always been a determined resistance to accept di-verse pathways to God. I have experienced this within my ownChristian church milieu. Repetitive worship practices and redundantsermons have undermined the anticipation of innovative thinking,of being stirred by “chutzpah,”the nerve to be different. By being toldto obey the static rules and believe only a predefined vision, for me,the magic was gone. I worry that the Christian world is driven by a sense of megalo- mania. The American Christian church body seems unaware that itis only a small part of the global mix. It operates oblivious to the factwe exist in a world of many variations on one theme: mankind, thewunderkind of Adam. Secretly, I began reading and learning about the Druids, Shtiks, Mayans, and other faiths. Avant-garde spirituality has never beenwelcome in the traditional Christian church, and mysticism isanathema. But I believe it is possible to appreciate the spiritual in na-ture without worshiping nature as God. A profound difference exists between appreciating and wor- shiping. The practice of one need not necessarily jeopardize the oth-er. I want to embrace past primitive generations and their notions ofthe relationship among sun, moon, stars, and their own lives. I wantto learn the orderly movement of the stars without seeking the coun-seling of the zodiac. I want to appreciate the love in the hearts of peo-ple who dance in adoration of the earth, wind, and fire without ap-plying for membership in their sect.1Wellness.qxd 7/19/03 5:27 PM Page 37"

Dreier,1953.I have been taught if one accepts Jesus Christ as the Son of God and believes in the cross-work of his death and resurrection, all will be well. But I also want to incorporate pictures of Native Americandances, admire Precambrian wall paintings of long-forgotten gods.I don’t want to be made to feel guilty for enjoying today’s New Agemusic with its harmonic consonance and nonlinear song forms.Surely, not everything in the secular life must be viewed as a threatto the sacred. My faith in the divinity of Jesus of Nazareth as the Sonof God cannot be weakened by my enjoyment of Celtic monotonicchants or seeking the counsel of the Buddhist wisdom proverbs. Because of my silence about exploring these new readings, there has been no pressure put on me to stifle my interest in the dynamicsof other faiths. Undoubtedly, the expedient conduct would be to re-treat into my Christian shell and keep my mind focused on the needto constantly repent for my own shortcomings. Y et how can I? How can I turn away from all there is to admire of God’s kaleidoscope world? Can all that variability be only evil? Isit not of his doing? I honestly don’t believe “human secularism” isthat inventive. I know the devil is clever and beautiful, but am I notallowed to enjoy beauty in and for itself? Why should “they” deny methe right to hug a tree, anoint myself in the ocean, or even carve myown totem pole? I long to hear the rhythms of strange faiths and feelthe joy in uniting with foreign hearts. God did not create me a mindless robot. I believe I am obligat- ed to use my divinely endowed free will to better discern God andhonor all he has done. And if I maintain theological vigilance, whynot allow myself to enjoy the unique, the fanciful, and the sincere no-tions that exist beyond the traditional Christian worldview. In so do-ing, I feel certain I will find an even more magnificent God withinthe diversity of his creations. Surely there is no finer way to appreci-ate him than to recognize his work—all of it. So the questions remain: Do I dare go down this different path? Do I have the right? How many dimensions are there to God? Is heav-en really populated only by Christians? Everything in me says my ex-amining quest is a good thing, and it is my dream that perhaps onefine day God and I will sit down over coffee, and because of my seek-ing we’ll have so much more to talk about.  ’ devotions have been published with the Baptists, Presbyterians, Catholics, and Evangelicals.

I condescended to all other paths because, as Maharishi put it, TM was the jet plane of spiritual practices, and, therefore, the “Zenies,” Hatha Y ogis, Sufis, etc., were only in helicopters or trains.They might get “there,” but more slowly and with more bumps alongthe way.

This is what I had always been seeking—through the disillusioned years of Hebrew school and in-side every spiritual book that found its way into my eager hands:Hesse’s Siddhartha, Salinger’s Franny and Zooey, Ram Dass’ Be Here Now. They were all leading me to Maharishi. Clothed in conservative dresses and low-heeled pumps, I gave introductory lectures and whispered mantras into my students’ ears.I looked like a born-again bankteller. Maharishi made sure no sarisor coral beads revealed our hidden passions. I spoke with words onlybarely my own. I was a coed version of a sixty-year-old monk. Mysentences ended with a Hindi lilt, erasing traces of my New Y orkJewish roots, erasing any trace of me. My mother told me I lost my sense of humor during those years. My jeans lay forgotten in my closet; my college friends stopped call-ing lest I try to convert them again. All my friends were now TM teachers who dressed and thought like me. The TMmovement was my church, my school, my political party. I chose a husband I wascertain Maharishi would approve of; I sent my first child to TMday- care. I signed off of phone calls with the prescribed “Jai Guru Dev,”as habitually as if it were “So long” or “Take care.” Most fantastic: Ibelieved that I could levitate, or even fly. At a point well into my TMcareer, I traveled to Switzerland to receive levitation instruction. I try to conjure up what was goingthrough my head en route to this course. Did I really believe I couldbe taught to defy gravity? Did I believe anyone could? Y es and no. Y esbecause I’d read Autobiography of a Yogi, which convincingly de- scribed yogis performing such feats, and, most importantly, becauseMaharishi said we could. And no, because, well, that should be ob-vious. Within a week, I was sitting in the lotus position and hopping around on a foam mattress like a frog. But a very happy frog, indeed.A spark of bliss would alight at the base of my spine and travel up-wards, igniting each vertebra like a pin ball, gathering points until itlit up my skull, and Pow!, I was off, hopping across a foam expanse.Up and down we all hopped, like yogic pogo sticks, digging our kneesinto foam, flinging forward, and flopping down on our bottoms, un-til we were off again. It felt good. Very good. There was no harm in that. The harm came later when I arrived home with a foam mattress roped onto thetop of my car and spent every evening depleting my parents’ patiencewhile quaking the floors of their suburban home. But my poundingwas not the worst of it.

I’d hover cross-legged, inches above the dinner table, careful not to dip a knee intothe gravy, and my parents would gaze upward, mouths open, in aweof their daughter, their Knower of Reality. But as years rolled on, my reality did not evolve into the one Maharishi had predicted. Complexities of adult life, such as a dyingfather and colicky baby, moved me to question my master and hismagic. And, to compound matters, I started noticing that some ofthe people I had once dismissed as less-evolved “non-meditators,” orfollowers of “inferior” paths, were actually far more balanced and incontrol of their lives than many of my TMteacher-friends and I were. Still, when an opportunity arose to boost my meditation practicewith yet another of Maharishi’s advanced techniques, I showed up—but this time with only half a heart and a hard-to-write check for$450. I waited, with a group of practitioners, for three hours in the halls of an upscale Boston hotel where the technique was to be giv-en. Our initiation flowers drooped and our offering bananasbrowned until we were finally led throughout the hotel and into theincense-filled initiation room. As the ceremony began, I sang alongwith the Sanskrit chant, and felt, as I always had, a wave of peace fromthose ancient words. When I received my advanced mantra, I was infact awakened, though not to the power of the mantra. Having justbeen traipsed through a busy hotel restaurant in my stocking feet,holding daisies, a pear, and a banana after waiting all afternoon andspending a month’s rent for a meaningless sound, I was awakened toa state of humiliation. My thoughts flew to my husband who had wisely refused to at- tend and who had months earlier grown a “forbidden” beard, forwhich our TMfriends had given him a hard time. These were the same friends who had failed to comfort me at the loss of my fatherby assuring me he would be reborn into a family of yogis, simply be-cause he had been a meditator. I looked around me at all the unnat-urally glowing faces and wondered: am I a member of a cult? I’ve never been quite sure. That day, I left the hotel quickly, lo- cating my pumps among dozens like them in the hallway. When I gothome, I threw them off, dug out my jeans and an old tie-dyed T-shirt and poured my body into them. Then, I looked in the mirror andvery slowly began to recognize myself again. I saw the seeker I’d always been—starting at six when I stood blissfully knee deep in autumn leaves and gazed up at a glorious bluesky.And again at fifteen, when uninspired by religious services I chal-lenged my rabbi to define God and came away unconvinced of his Barbi Schulick1Wellness.qxd 7/19/03 5:27 PM Page 44"

And at nineteen, on the day of my TMinstruction, when bliss again resonated and cleared the foggy layers of my conscious- ness, filling the halls of the meditation center with silence. Now I marveled at my thirty-year-old reflection in the mirror, wearing jeans for the first time in ten years. I picked up one of mydiscarded pumps on the floor and reflected on Maharishi with a con-fusing mix of gratitude and resentment. Could I blame the masterfor the trappings of his movement? I didn’t know, but I did know Icould no longer represent his cause. I moved on—nursing an amalgamation of emotions, vowing never to follow a guru again.Y et I felt like an infidel as I experimentedwith alternative meditation forms and shipped off my levitationpractice to the yogis of the Himalayas. But, in time, my guilt was as-suaged, and I remembered that Maharishi didn’t hold a monopolyon the spiritual. There were angels assigned to other posts waiting tobe revealed. I found them inside the beat of a Kabalistic chant, leap-ing off the pages of a Buddhist bestseller, and trickling up my spineas I swung into a yogic shoulder stand. The spiritual, I know now, has been hidden in every moment of my fifty years, be they confused or certain, angry or benign.

In fact, to use the bow effectively, she cut off a breast, sacrificing the very symbolof her womanhood. The Amazon had been my professional direction: I went to school, I joined the Navy, I went to graduate school, I started teach-ing right away—boom, boom, boom, and boom—with no time tothink about what I was feeling or that I was a woman or about get-ting married or anything like that. But, at sixty-eight, I realized thatliving out the Amazon myth was not something that I wanted any-more. The Amazon myth by itself had become inadequate, unrealis-tic, perhaps negative. I needed a more balanced personal myth, onethat would combine the positives of the Amazon warrior with thepower of feelings. When I did this inner work, I made a very strangediscovery. I found that my inner self was a girl. I never knew that. Ilived my whole life as a professional, a neuter. I preached. I did mychurch work.

Eventually I learned that, as a child, I came to believe that it’s not good to be a girl. There’s something very wrong about being a girl. This feeling came from my mother. She was a child of an alcoholic and found that she had to put away her own childlikeness. My experienceas a girl infant was: If I let myself enjoy that closeness and that joy, my whole world, my support, will go away! I experienced this withdraw- ing of my mother and concluded that I must be something awful be-cause what I did was send her away, and, therefore, I’m never goingto feel—and I’m certainly not going to be a little girl! I grew up witha resolute dedication to do for myself. I was always alone when Iplayed, turning away from home, looking out for myself. Although I got in touch with the little girl inside me, she could not give me the joy in who I am. Perhaps it was because my motherwas simply not there for me at a deep, emotional level. Sure, she lovedme. She cared for me. She supported me. She was proud of what I accomplished. She gave me everything she could, absolutely. Butshe wasn’t there for me with any kind of intensity, that kind of emo-tional closeness. She didn’t know that, of course, and I didn’t knowthat either. One important thing about this reconstruction process is that no one in particular causes the problem purposely. It was not that Iscared my mother away or that I did something so awful. Likewise,my mother’s withdrawal was a natural outcome of her childhood ex-periences. Growing up with an alcoholic father, she learned to protectherself. Don’t talk; don’t trust; don’t feel.

One thing that helpedme was to imagine my positive, beautiful child and to think aboutwhat caused her to act in ways that no longer worked for me. I believe that every human being, down deep, has that image of the positive self, that we, thank God, cannot destroy. We can shutdown. We can postpone. We can bury. But we cannot destroy. T o rediscover that positive self, sometimes we must relive our earliest memories.

She said, Don’t ever say what you feel and don’t ever feel angry, because if you do, I’ll nevercome back. So the little girl stopped telling people how she felt. She stopped feeling angry. She decided not to talk to anybody and not tofeel at all so that this would never happen again. The little girl went away to play and do things by herself. She sat under a tree, and she felt the line between herself and other people.She picked up that line and turned it into a sword, so she could keepeverybody at a distance and have her own protected, special place. That was my protection. I was not going to let anybody know what I needed, that I wanted help, or that I needed to be close. I wasnot going to feel and let anybody know my feelings.

      "text": "How did this philosophy of life function for me? After all, I took it on to survive. When I got to talking to my Amazon, she said, I kept you functioning. You can’t just do anything you feel like doing. I kept your attention on what had to be done, to do it well, to feel good aboutyourself. I put your message about having to be first and to be strong ina good light. I protected you from all the contradictory feelings that con-fuse and hurt. I gave you a goal that you could reach to give you mean-ing. I was there when you needed me to make it through, to finish whatyou started. I gave you a sense of honor and drive. I remember playing high-school field hockey. I would come home with a great bruise on my leg with no awareness as to how Igot it because I had been totally focused on what I was doing. I waswrapped up in the emergency mode, the discipline of the Amazon. Iwas surviving, and I was winning. Fortunately, my Amazon chose for me a career of college teach- ing which was productive, useful, and helpful to people. It just didnot deal with all of me. It was a perfectly intelligent, useful job thathad to be done. A critical step for me in the reconstruction of my personal myth was to think about the shift from survival to living. I wanted to keepthe strength of the original myth, but add to it, so that I could bewhole. It’s not enough to just survive. My Amazon says, You ought to be able to handle what comes. But feelings are not something that you control. All human beings arepart of a whole, and all human beings need closeness—receiving andsharing. T otal independence is not strength. It’s only half real.Substantial strength is being able to experience closeness. The Amazon for me was the cutting off of my child, the woman, and the feminine side for the sake of winning as the warrior and tonot become distracted by the need for the child, the husband, and re-lationship. The Amazon sacrificed her own nature for a concept. Itmeant living life as if it were an emergency. There was no time forneeds. Always in a state of war, I walked a tightrope, with the con-stant tension as to whether I would make it. That’s okay for a shorttime; it’s kind of fun. But it’s not okay as a lifestyle or philosophy oflife. As I became aware of the little girl within, I began to experienceher feminine side and learned that she needed time, that she felt feel-ings, and that she had needs. It was then that my Amazon myth start-ed breaking down. Ask yourself what is your myth, your philosophy of life, that no longer works for you. Then ask what new experience, what new thinghas come into the picture, that conflicts with that philosophy. Howdoes your personal myth defend those times of uneasiness? When doyou know that something needs to change? Dorothea Harvey1Wellness.qxd 7/19/03 5:27 PM Page 50"

      "text": "The final task in my reconstruction process was the creation of a unifying myth. The new myth can’t be something that says that everything you have done so far is hopeless and wrong. That isn’t re-alistic. That first myth kept us alive and brought us to this point.There are things in it that are part of how we have coped, and it’s whowe are. The new myth needs to be more encompassing, more uni-versal. The Amazon survived in absolute loneliness. I took up thatloneliness as my sword and said, All right. That’s mine. Now I’m safe because I can keep everybody out there away, and I’m never, never go-ing to get hurt again. The transformation to my new myth had to uni- fy my need for protection from others with my need for closeness. Using fairy tales, I was able to reinvent my life’s mythology. Fairy tales do not need to be absolute or literally realistic. I could begin asan infant and then be the one who walked away into the woods. Thetime sequence is like dreams where anything can happen. Y ou can gooff in a balloon; you can make rhythms with a lion; you can do what-ever you need to do. That’s the beauty of working with fairy tales.Y ou can take the philosophy of life that you adopted to protect your-self, add to it, and make it into the fairy tale that is right for you. In my fairy tale, my little girl went off into the forest with a sword. She liked the forest and liked being alone so that she couldchoose for herself which way she wanted to go. Nobody could get tooclose to scare her when she had her sword. But then she saw some-one else, just sitting there, enjoying the forest too, a medicine womanwho didn’t look dangerous at all. The little girl looked at the medi-cine woman, and she didn’t want to go away. She wanted to be therein the lap of the medicine woman who looked wise and good. Sheput down her sword, got into that wonderful big lap, and it felt good. What I did literally, sometime later, was to get a jewelry maker to make me a small, gold feather, which I wear on a gold chain withgood feeling.

This separation is strongly suggested by my ac-tual experiences. During chemotherapy, I had swollen hands and feet,and a slight headache: my body was speaking, but what was it saying? Our body gives us transitory and chronic symptoms. Both call out for our attention. Without this guidance from the body, we maywell fail in its care and kill ourselves. The chronic symptoms—themessages we receive over and over—are the more important. Theycall out to the self to pay attention, for compassion. If we seek somepill for relief, very often the pill doesn’t correct the real problem. Itcovers it over, and the underlying issues remain.Opposite: Thomas Eakins. The Thinker: Portrait of Louis N.

In the literature, Ifound one other person who followed the same procedure with thesame result. Somehow the body speaks to us in symptoms, but it isan obscure language we often don’t understand. The body is not entirely a physical machine. Saints have lived on cabbage soup or nettles for years. Everything should have gone wrongif the body were a simple machine that just needed the right tending.Then a great insight came to me. The body is like a faithful dog. It isa different creature from us, but one who wants to be with us, to serveus. It gives out its whimpers, which we must try to interpret. Like the faithful dog that can do without much food or rest, as long as we show our bodies our loving attention, the body ultimate-ly really wants our compassion. And how can we easily do that? Bysimply being with it when it expresses its difficulty in symptoms—paying attention, noticing its difficulty. That’s what symptoms cryout for. It is very like sitting up with a sick friend when you (the self)really don’t know how to help. I am convinced many a mother hashealed her child by loving care alone. Love is expressed, and this ismore essential than medicine. Now contrast this loving compassion for the body to the quick downing of even the right pill. The underlying message of this act is,Quit bothering me. Shut up with your symptoms. I am busy. This is the direct opposite of loving compassion. The real puzzle can be the body’s nearly constant (in old age) language of symptoms. Clearly it is talking, but saying what, to whatend? Is it saying fix me? In part this is true. A painful cut responds to cleansing and bandaging until the body can heal it. But the deepestimplication of symptom language is, Be with me, notice me, care for me.Repeatedly, I have discovered that intense awareness of pain will cause the pain to change, vary, and eventually float away. But whyshould this happen if it is simply a physical problem? Fundamentally,our faithful dog or body wants our compassion. This compassion ismore central than any medicine and can substitute for medicine. A deeper issue lies in chronic symptoms that turn up year after year. Such symptoms are very difficult to read directly. The Hindusaptly say the aspect of life we neglect eventually becomes a physicalsymptom. In part, we can look at the very function of the organ in-volved. If our heart is involved, it must involve our life, love, feeling,any of the strong emotions that are central to our life, etc. EmanuelSwedenborg’s organ correspondences and the findings of psychoso-matic medicine are suggestive, yet merely suggestive, a place to startin the process of dialoguing with the body. Wilson Van Dusen1Wellness.qxd 7/19/03 4:29 PM Page 58"

Chronic symptoms remind us of resourceswe aren’t using. But direct reading of them is difficult. Patient atten-tive compassion to the body is enough in itself. One can thereby re-solve a problem without ever consciously figuring it out—just as amother can heal a sick child without knowing either the disease orits treatment. So I de-emphasize figuring out the symptom language,even though it is full of hints, and emphasize basic loving attentionto our faithful body.

All our difficulties are created for our edification. We can have short-term problems (the faucet leaks) or chronic problems (a businessman fails in several enterprises). Short-termproblems teach us a lesson we can grasp and use. Chronic problemsare more revealing. They call out to us that there are some things wehaven’t fully grasped and solved yet.When dealing with bodily symp-toms, chronic problems ask us to reflect on them. There is, however,a difference. Bodily problems speak of a lesson within ourselves.Other people are not really involved. Problems in the world, howev-er, speak of a lesson with others and/or God. For the most part, prob-lems in outer circumstances teach us about our relations with oth-ers and the world. Compassion can play a role in difficulties between self and the world.

She offered to pay the fee and, after we talked about it,asked if she could come along. I was delighted to spend time with myaunt, who’d taken up Spanish at sixty and tap dance lessons at sixty-five. After I told my mother, she insisted on joining us. Not because of any interest in Buddhism, but to make sure her older sister didn’tspend any more time with me than she did. Still, she wanted to makeit clear that while she was going to the retreat, she would not bespeaking to my aunt. “Mom, why don’t you talk to Gen?”“Because of what she did to me.” She turned to face me, her lips clamped shut. I’d asked her before and knew I wasn’t going to get any infor- mation. Once, after badgering her for more than a week, she’d toldme her grudge had something to do with borrowed money. Gen toldme that her husband Sam had lent my father a few hundred dollars,which he’d never repaid. She claimed it was no big deal and didn’tknow why my mother still made a fuss about it. But I knew Sam, agruff, self-made man with a long memory. If money was involved,Sam would not have let my father or mother forget about it. Since I’d initially agreed to go with Gen, I decided to drive with her. Mom said that was fine, but of course, she wouldn’t think of be-ing in the same vehicle as her sister. As Gen and I slid into SpiritRock’s parking lot, my mother slowly rolled in beside us. “Hello, Sarah,” Gen called out, as we got out of our respective cars. “Hmmmm,” my mother nodded and glared at me.The meditation center was cool and cozy. A few dozen students were already inside, shoes off, sitting silently. Gen and I picked outsome pillows and found a place to sit. My mother did the same butfound a spot as far away from us as she could while still maintaininga clear line of sight. The teacher rang the bell twice and instructed us on the day’s ac- tivities: silent sitting, silent walking, silent eating. I looked across thehall at my mother, who was silently frowning. The morning passed quickly, and in my meditation I lost track of my aunt and mother, and sometimes, for a few short moments,even myself. I was surprised when, at lunch, my mother placed her-self at our table, directly across from Gen. Each of them chewed their food fiercely, their eyes shooting nee- dles across the table. Then, Gen stuck out her tongue at my mother. Silent Retreat1Wellness.qxd 7/19/03 4:29 PM Page 65"

Gen burst out laughing. My mother giggled. Both of them con- tinued eating, flashing shy smiles the rest of the meal. Later, during walking meditation, I saw them slowly and silent- ly stepping, arm-in-arm. From a distance they looked like two grace-ful birds dancing together. At the end of the retreat, as my aunt and I were putting away our pillows, my mother walked passed us without so much as a glance. “Wasn’t that a nice day, Sarah,” Gen called after her.“Hmmmmmmh,” my mother responded, without turning her head. She kept on walking out of the center and into the parking lot. “Mom, Mom,” I called, as I ran after her.“I thought you and Gen made up.” “No,” my mother bit off the words, “I’m still not talking to her.”“But what about lunch and walking with her?”“That’s not talking to her,” she said, but for a second, I thought I saw the shadow of a sly smile skip across her lips.

I have followed a pragmatic path using the logic that, since my emotions and spirit are housed in this body, I had best take care ofit. Even before coming to the conclusion that spiritual, physical, andemotional well-being support each other, one of my life’s goals hadbeen to learn to cook well. Especially after I changed my diet fromheavy meat-eating to macrobiotics, cooking for myself became im-perative. Our society is not geared towards ecologically sound eatingnor choosing foods with respect to the season. Macrobiotics translates as “big life” or looking at the complete picture of life. T o follow a macrobiotic diet, you eat what grows lo-cally, what is in season, and according to traditional nutrition pat-terns. More emphasis is placed on whole grains, vegetables, beans,and condiments to balance the acid and alkaline traits of foods. Y oupay attention to how you feel emotionally and physically. When I’mfeeling spacy and ungrounded, it’s a sure sign that I’ve eaten toomany sweets. If I’m feeling stuck and uninspired, I’ve been eating thesame thing too often. The emphasis is on balance and abiding by thelaws of nature. If it’s the middle of winter, your body does not needcooling summer fruits like watermelon. Likewise, in the middle ofsummer, you are not likely to crave a hearty, thick stew. I knew I had a lot to learn since I grew up in the sixties and sev- enties: a time when food was increasingly imported from far off places with different climates. Advanced technology made per-ishable foods available year-round. This trend led away from eating seasonal foods.1Wellness.qxd 7/19/03 4:29 PM Page 73"

Learning how to use food for healing, I joked that I learned how to not only cook food, but wearit. I spent over a week wearing a tofu plaster on my shaved-for-this-purpose head. Open to experimentation, I noticed that I began sleep-ing and feeling better. I was thirty-nine years old, had left a steadyjob as an educator, and was walking around with a pound of tofu onmy head under a bandanna, never feeling better in my life. Howbizarre! I was following my dream and for the first time in my lifewas actively pursuing a course of right livelihood. To e a ch p e r s o n , right livelihood has a different meaning, thank goodness. How many macrobiotic cooks could the world support?In choosing a fulfilling profession in which we are helping others andharming no one, we find satisfaction. Eventually, I sought employment as a cook where I would not have to compromise my dietary principles. Initially, I surfed the in-ternet for vegetarian retreats, but realizing that Buddhists are vege-tarian, I narrowed my search to Buddhist centers. I was in alignmentwith Buddhist thinking, having lived in East and Southeast Asia. Itwas not long before I was working at a Buddhist retreat center. After cooking breakfast and lunch at the meditation center, I was free to go on long bike rides in the afternoon. In the evening, I couldattend the dharma talks or retreat to the sauna. While I was cooking,things were great. Harvesting vegetables and herbs from the gardenand cooking them was like a meditation. Cooking for groups vary-ing in size from fifteen to fifty, I soon learned how to gauge propor-tions and cook for the participants’ needs. After hearing the story ofa retreatant who referred to his small room as “the gas chamber,” Iknew to avoid cooking beans as a general rule. When I cooked forTibetan Buddhist retreats, I could not use what they called “blackfoods”: onions, garlic, mushrooms, etc. I despaired for days, think-ing it was impossible to cook with this restriction, but I managed. Despite the challenges, I felt calm and peaceful while in the gar- den or cooking. When I put food in the ovens or on the stoves, I settimers out of habit, but I often would check a dish just seconds be-fore the alarm went off. Cooking became instinctual, second nature.I knew it was right livelihood. There has to be more to spiritual well-being than this, however. I have rarely felt so lonely as I did at this retreat center. One womanon our small staff took an immediate dislike to me. T o this day, I donot know what happened to precipitate this feeling in her. It madefor a most unsatisfying relationship. The staff was allowed to talk toeach other but often didn’t.

These women had strong, loud voices,and it seemed as if they were arguing.

In fact, the pranic life-force is the only force in theworld that can heal. The spiritual life-force spontaneously heals all sorts of illnesses, injuries, and diseases without the aid of doctors, medicines, or “out-side” help of any kind. At their best, all medicines and healing tech-niques serve in the same capacity as a splint does to a broken bone.They can facilitate the process of healing.

      "text": "My own experiences in healing with the breath have repeatedly confirmed the truth of these ancient teachings. I’ve seen firsthand how breathing blocks can create a broad spectrum of physical andemotional problems, ranging from asthma and gastrointestinal dis-orders to manic-depressive behavior and psychotic breaks. However,the connection between breathing blocks and illness by no meansends here. I believe that all diseases of the mind and body are insep- arably linked with the blocks in our breathing. This includes physi-cal disorders ostensibly due to “external” factors, such as accidents,infections, and birth defects. Fear is the link that connects our breathing blocks with all forms of human illness.Where there is disease or injury, there is always painand fear, and all experiences of pain or fear are completely controlledby the breath. When we feel scared or hurt, for example, we instinc-tively tend to hold our breath in order to block the feelings of fear inour mind or the sensations of pain in our body.Whenever we do this,we invariably create stressful tensions throughout our system. In most people, these tensions appear as a vague sense of worry in their minds and minor feelings of stress in various parts of thebody. As breathing blocks grow stronger with time, these ill-definedfeelings can gradually worsen and take the form of recognizablemedical disorders. For example, once-vague feelings of mental un-easiness can eventually develop into serious emotional disorderssuch as feelings of chronic anxiety, depression, paranoia, and obses-sive-compulsive behavior. The corresponding state of anxious tension reflected in the tis- sues of the body is the cause of many more “physical” problems thanmost medical doctors currently suspect. I have found, for example,that most breathing disorders, such as asthma and emphysema, areprimarily caused by the fear-ridden blocks in one’s breathing.Although extenuating factors such as cigarette smoking, environ-mental pollutants, and allergies often play a significant role in the de-velopment of breathing disorders, in most cases, they are usually notthe primary cause, but merely contributing factors. Ironically, holding our breath to block or suppress feelings of fear does nothing to reduce the amount of fear in our system; it onlyreduces our awareness of that fear. The fear is not gone; it has only been pushed deeper inside where it turns into anxiety. The layers offear that stay trapped in our system exacerbate all symptoms of ill-ness. In some cases, they can even create entirely new symptoms,which have nothing to do with the original illness or injury itself. The good news is that this blocking process can be reversed.

Pranic Energy Healing   , I have developed a mind–body therapy, which I call Pranic Energy Healing because it uses the pranic life-force to promote mental and physical healing. Pranic Energy Healing employs a com-bination of meditation, breathing, and gentle body-work techniquesthat enable me to release the fear-ridden blocks in a person’s mindand body and transmit booster shots of healing prana to the diseasedparts of his or her system. These same meditation and breathingtechniques allow me to accurately “read”the state of my client’s emo-tions, enabling me to discern the repressed emotions that are linkedwith specific physical problems. One of the most powerful aspects of Pranic Energy Healing is that it enables me to use my breath to “vacuum” pain, fear, and ten-sion from another person’s system. As I work with my clients, theycan actually feel waves of anxious energy and long-held tensions gen-tly leaving their mind and body. Most people experience immediateimprovement (sometimes full release) of chronic symptoms thathave plagued them for years. I’ve repeatedly seen how using thebreath to release layers of “trapped” fear from a person’s system canbring about seemingly miraculous healings of chronic conditions—conditions that couldn’t be alleviated by conventional forms oftreatment. One particularly dramatic healing occurred some years ago at one of my seminars when I was working with “Karen,” a volunteerfrom the audience. Karen had been in constant pain for thirty-fiveyears after her leg had been crushed in a childhood accident. The firstthing I did was to teach her how to meditate on the movements ofher breath. Then I set to work with my hands and breath to drawsome of the pain and fear from her leg. Within minutes, Karen began to relive the day of the accident. She remembered how scared she had been in the emergency room,and how both her father and the doctor had sternly ordered her tostifle her tears. She also realized that she had been repressing thosefeelings of terror for thirty-five years. That evening the pain inKaren’s leg disappeared and never returned.

Whenever wehold our breath to block fearful emotions or feelings of pain, we cre-ate contradictory tensions throughout our system that weaken our natural defenses and increase our susceptibility to infectious diseases. As the following case history illustrates, self-conflict not only de- pletes our inner resources, it also can cause harm to our body bymaking us clumsy and accident-prone. When “Ann” called to sched-ule a healing session, she told me that two years earlier she had fall-en and fractured a number of bones in her ankle. Despite her doc-tors’ best efforts, the ankle had stubbornly refused to heal. By thetime she called me, Ann’s ankle had developed an infection knownas “tuberculosis of the bone,” and she was scheduled for surgery inthree weeks. Her doctors were going to scrape the bones in an effortto stop the infection—but they weren’t very hopeful about the out-come. If the procedure proved unsuccessful, they would have to am-putate her foot. During our first session, I learned that Ann was harboring in- tense feelings of anger and fear toward her injured ankle. Her deter-mination to “push-away” her fear and pain was so incredibly strongit seemed as if she had already mentally cut her foot off at the ankle.As I worked to lift some of the fear and tension that had accumulat-ed over the past two years, the pain, swelling, and discoloration inher ankle gradually began to subside. By the end of our first session,Ann was able to walk much more comfortably. She was less afraid toput some weight on her ankle and was feeling much less angry andresentful toward her injured body. By the end of our second session,her ankle showed even greater signs of improvement. Our third session took place just four days before Ann was scheduled to undergo surgery. That morning, she arrived at my of-fice with the wonderful news that her doctor had canceled the oper-ation because her ankle was healing normally. Her doctor said, “Idon’t know what you’re doing that’s different, but whatever it is, justkeep on doing it.” Ann didn’t dare tell him about the unconventional kind of work she’d been doing with me, but she knew that it had made the criticaldifference. When I thought she was ready to “hear” my full diagno-sis of her condition, I said, “Can you see that it was only your angerand fear that kept your ankle from healing?” “Y es.”“Well, here’s something else for you to think about.

They are very real, and theyare also extremely practical. Y ou do not have to be a gifted psychic orhighly accomplished yogi in order to heal yourself with your breath.Anyone who studies the science of breath with discipline and regu-larity can learn to access the healing energies contained in the breathand direct them at will. Learning to heal or alleviate relatively minorproblems, such as headaches, muscular tensions, chronic pain, andanxiety, is remarkably easy to do. The more serious or deep-rootedan illness, the greater one’s mastery of breath must be to effect sig-nificant healing. Pranic energy healing is an inborn talent in everyone but usual- ly needs to be awakened. Since accomplished teachers of this art havebeen rare, most people who have learned how to heal with theirbreath have intuitively developed this gift on their own. Pranic en-ergy healers tend to be more common in traditional societies. Someof the curanderos or folk healers of Brazil are known to use their breath in this way. The same is true of certain folk healers in Indiaand China. Healers with this natural healing ability can appear any-where. I once heard of an old woman in a small coal-mining town inOhio who could use her breath to “blow the fire out of burns.” Aslong as the injured person was immediately brought to her for treat-ment, the burns would heal rapidly—without pain and without blis-tering. This unusual ability was passed on to her granddaughter. Even without the help of an accomplished teacher, anyone can begin to learn how to heal with the breath by studying breath-relat-ed practices such as Hatha Y oga, Tai Chi, and Chi Kung. These an-cient spiritual disciplines embody effective techniques for enhancingthe flow of prana or chi throughout the mind and body. The healingenergies of the life-force can also be accessed by practicing any of thetime-honored spiritual disciplines, such as meditation, chanting,prayer, and the repetition of divine names. Nevertheless, the sim-plest, fastest, and most direct way to access the healing energies con-tained in the breath is through a knowledgeable control of breathingtechniques. Andrew Caponigro1Wellness.qxd 7/19/03 4:29 PM Page 84"

This is because the meditative state of con-sciousness is the only state in which we can access the healing ener-gies of the life-force and direct them where we will. Furthermore, theeffectiveness of all other breathing techniques ultimately depends onthe depth and the quality of our meditative state. Meditation quiets our “everyday” mind and guides it into a fear- less, calm, and detached state that is known as witness consciousness.It is only from within this detached state that we can “return” to thefeelings of pain and fear we originally blocked and give them the spe-cial attention they need. Although our breathing blocks affect everythought, emotion, and cell in our physical body, we cannot detectthem in our “everyday” state of mind because they become secondnature. Meditation on the breath induces a state of meditative sen-sitivity and inner self-awareness that enable us to perceive these hid-den blocks and study them in minute detail. While in the meditation state, the first thing we notice are the surface distortions in our breathing patterns. These take the form ofvarious tensions, slacknesses, erratic rhythms, and brief cessations inthe movements of our breath. At deeper levels of meditative con-sciousness, we can actually perceive the underground streams ofanxiety that we have created by suppressing our breath in fear. Thesame techniques that enable us to detect the blocks in our breathingalso enable us to release those blocks and dry up the subconsciousstreams of anxiety. Releasing the blocks in our breathing also en-hances the flow of prana to the parts of our mind and our body thatwere formerly blocked and deprived.

Geologic eras, like the forces that scooped out Wildcat Canyon, are measured in millennia. But shorter measures exist in Wildcat—scars from landfalls, for instance. Some are barely detectable withmature trees growing in their trenches.Y ounger landfalls are coveredwith grass or brush. Landfalls left behind by last winter’s storms stillshow fresh brown scars. About a mile in, crumbling asphalt gives way to a wide dirt trail. I hike around what I call Reptile Corner where my steps sometimesfreeze gopher snakes or send alligator lizards scooting for safety. Thepath follows a terrace below the ridge but still high above WildcatCreek. Occasionally, a coyote slinks across my path, stopping tosmirk before going about its business. Every blue moon, I look intothe triangular face of an alert red fox. It immediately darts for cover,and I track its bushy tail through the tall grass up the hillside. Highoverhead, Red-tailed Hawks fly vigilant circles while, closer to earth,funereal turkey vultures, their tiny red heads looking too small fortheir wingspans, hang suspended on thermals. Sometimes I duck asthey swoop down toward perches in the madrone and black oak for-est that crowds the creek below. On weekends I’m a hiker, not a walker, the way some people call themselves runners, not joggers. I churn past my normal turnaroundpoint and puff up a steep trail where moist shade yields wild cu-cumber, miner’s lettuce, and other treats that exposed trails don’t of-fer. On ambitious Sundays, I power-walk through another couple ofmiles to a pond where turtles sit on rocks in the sun. But my weekday forays into Wildcat are introspective strolls, work breaks where I walk out resentments and talk things over withmyself. Weekdays I turn around at a horse trough about two milesin.As I walk back, I reflect on the landfalls in my own life—the fright-ening transition away from the corporate world, the surgeon tellingme I have cancer, the loss of a child. Some of my personal landfalls have grown in. A few remain freshly scarred. As I start up the last big hill that leads back over therim, I spot artichoke thistle hiding what was pavement last year.

Rememberthat when you give your report, the committee will know you are fin-ished when you say, ‘the beginning.’” “Why say ‘the beginning’ and not ‘the end?’”“Because life is a series of beginnings, and when you finish your report, we will begin to use the information, just as graduations arenot terminations but commencements, and the Bible ends inRevelation and not a conclusion.”        , I have seen that too of- ten religion, parenting, and our education system lead to guilt, shame, and blame. When used or interpreted improperly, they be-come unhealthy parts of our upbringing. We truly need to awakento the feelings and wisdom of our hearts. Love and laughter are thegreat healers, but too often we do not make time for them until wehave little time left and accept our mortality. We are all wounded. When people ask me, “How are you?” I an- swer, “Depressed. Out of my antidepressant and my doctor is away,so I can’t renew my prescription.” Eighty percent of people answer,“I know how you feel.” Others offer me their antidepressants andmore importantly share their pain with a stranger because they knowI will understand. So remember: in love’s service, only the woundedsoldier can serve. Despite our wounds,we can still laugh. The love and humor I talk about are childlike in nature. I learned that acting like a child helpedme to see the world with joy and bring out the child in others. WhenI see a sign “Wet Floor,” I wet the floor.

Through love and laughter, one maintains a sense of connection despite the difficulties of life. From that connection, a sense of self-esteem and self-worth are developed. By middle age, of those chil-dren who described their parents as loving, only twenty-five percenthad suffered a major illness, while of those who said their parentswere not loving, almost one-hundred percent had suffered a majorillness. People who own pets will smoke outdoors to protect their pets. They will kill themselves but not do anything to hurt their belovedpets. As Maimonides said centuries ago, “If we would treat ourselvesas kindly as we treat our animals, we would suffer fewer illnesses.” Soadopt a pet and be as kind to yourself as you are to your pet. Life is uncertain. Eat dessert first. Hope, love, and a sense of hu- mor are vital to survival in the face of uncertainty. Volunteers andoptimists live longer, healthier lives. People with spiritual supportalso are healthier, and I have had patients who had so-called incur-able diseases disappear when they “left their troubles to God”or wenthome to “make the world beautiful” before they died. Do not try tonot die. It doesn’t work. In heaven, the bitterest people are the vege-tarian, meditating joggers who wish they had slept late and tasted alobster or steak. Live your life as if you are going to die, and use your lifetime do- ing what feels good and makes you happy. In other words, live your“chocolate ice cream.” The byproduct will be a longer, healthier life.Remember information does not change people, but inspirationdoes. Just as God breathed life into Adam’s nostrils so are we to in-spire ourselves and others.

An actor ina comedy has low stress hormone levels and excellent immune func-tion, but the same performer in a tragedy can be made sick becausehis immune function is altered by the role he or she is playing.

Surely, a delivery could be arranged. Of course, he could picksomething up at Say Cheese, but their prices were exorbitant com-pared to the Good Food deal, even including the freight.

If he was fortunate, a pre-ponderance of good things and not too many awful things happenedto him. Then, he died. Finito. Avery realized that other lines of thought, caviar and cham- pagne, marketing ploys and sales traps, had not completely fallenaway, but his awareness of the physical, sensational progression of histhought subsumed them. He felt himself thinking! It was happeningin his body, this thinking. It was an extraordinary, nearly miraculous,and highly peculiar self-intimacy, never before experienced, trans-forming processes of thought and emotion experienced in the cru-cible of his body. “I sense,” she said,“that you begin to understand.” Her voice was all breath, with an edge of excitement.“Y ou see that awareness of be-ing commences as sensation? This is being, Avery. This is how it feelsin your body.” A wave of emotion broke over him, wild exhilaration, unexpect- ed and conflicted; it was uncontainable. It filled Avery up. It was joy,immense, but tremendously fragile, and so, simultaneously, unimag-inably poignant. “Y ou see that you are, yourself, the key. The sensation of your body is your link to this moment and to each succeeding moment,and so to all of us here, to the Manifold Manifestations of theUniversal Godhead. Y ou do see, don’t you?” Avery did see. He was afraid to speak for fear of losing the re- markable sensation. “It is tenuous, we know. So-called thought and feeling will in- terfere. They heave to the future, cleave to the past, to your constructsand the habitual, but sensation is always available. The link that youhave made is available because your physical body is always, ab-solutely, in the moment. Do you see Avery?” Her voice had receded slightly.The fineness of his perception was now almost painful to him, and Avery did see.

It was natural to you. That is why we know you by name,Avery. The Christ often mentions ‘the little children’ when peoplespeak with him. He is reminding them of the simplicity of the childthat they still carry within, the ability of the child to enter into a mo-ment entirely, to treat it as play.” “This is play?” said Avery, doubt in his voice.“It isplay,” she said, “although maintaining it may later seem to be work. There is prayer, of course, of many kinds. Many people findthat helpful. There is meditation. There are various kinds of workwith the breath and certain types of movement. It is all in aid of thesame thing.” “In aid of being?”“Yes, Avery.”“T o what end?”“Unification.”“Of?”“Of yourself and, therefore, of the Manifold Manifestations of the Universal Godhead. In those terms, the endeavor to be, to unify,is in the service of your Creator. Understanding that requires time and study. It is a much larger understanding than what we have at-tempted here, Avery.” Her voice was definitely lower, as if she had moved a distance away. Unavoidably, thoughts of Amy ascended in Avery’s head and then the Good Food catalog and the number he had intended to dial.It was a cascade of the mundane. Avery sensed, at once, a decline ofsensation, a decline in his awareness of his body. He struggled tomaintain the connection. It did not feel like play. She spoke,and the volume of her voice was lower still.“The larg- er intention is symbolized in your physical world in thousands ofwonderful ways. The word ‘love’ is such a symbol, often signified by representations of the pierced heart muscle or the cruciform,sometimes by animal representations, and, of course, there is thewhite rose.” The Manifold Manifestations1Wellness.qxd 7/19/03 4:31 PM Page 105"

Know that, even without understanding, it is enough for now to simply strive for sen- sation.” “I’m losing it!” he cried out.“It cannot be lost, only misplaced. Thank you for giving me this opportunity to be of service to you, Avery. Thank you.” Her voice had faded out as if someone had been gradually turn- ing down the volume on a stereo. The telephone line went dead. “Wait!”Quite suddenly and loudly, Avery heard the dial tone. He set the phone down in its cradle. His body was inert, a lump, except for a slight buzz on the sur- face, as if he had goose pimples all over. He felt bereft. What had hap-pened to him? Avery glanced at his watch and knit his brow. The conversation had seemed long, a half or at least a quarter of an hour. He had sat down and dialed the number at roughly nineo’clock but now, the second hand of his watch was just progressingaway from the hour. Had it been a dream? Had he nodded off at his desk and made up the whole extraordinary episode? No. He had definitely dialed the phone. He would have been or- dering later than the deadline, but it had seemed worth the effort.Amy had been so excited by the pictures in the catalog. He wouldhave happily paid extra for priority overnight delivery just to see theexpression of pleasure and surprise on her face. “T oo bad we’re too late,” she had said, closing the catalog, and from that point on Avery had been plotting. His thoughts returned, seamlessly, to these ordinary paths. They felt comfortable, worn as old slippers warped to the shape ofhis feet. His recollection of the exhilaration, the sensations of joy andof danger from seconds before were blunted. There was just enoughleft of the extraordinary awareness so that he could faintly recall the difference. He sat at his desk looking at the telephone. All he had to do was punch the redial button, and he would be reconnected. Suddenly the phone rang! Avery grabbed the handset before the first ring had ended.“Sweetheart?”“Amy!”“Have you been running? Y ou sound out of breath.

She had found beautiful whiteasparagus. She had bought their favorite Chardonnay and was mak-ing a pear and brandy tart. The impulse to tell her about the strange call evaporated as she prattled on. How could Avery explain what had happened? Already,the substance and the shape of it, the voices, the music, even the ex-traordinary character of his sensation had receded exactly as dreamsdo on waking. No time had passed. He had verified that by his watch.It had been amazingly vivid, but he had no words to explain it, andit was almost gone now, almost entirely gone. “Sorry you have to work tomorrow,” said Amy. “We’ll make up for it in the evening. Y ou’ll see.” “See you by seven,” he said.“Love you,” said Amy.“Y ou too,” and he punched the hook to disconnect.Suddenly, aggressively, Avery punched the redial button. He heard beep-tones and then the ring. He held his breath. “Thank you for calling Good Food. All of our representatives are busy with other customers, but your call is very important to us andwill be taken in the order received.

Avery worked at the office, completing a report for his boss. He felt out of sorts, peculiar. Hescrewed up the data in his spreadsheet and had to rebuild a wholesection of it. He was strangely forgetful and short-tempered. He hadnot slept well, and his general uneasiness carried through to theevening when he found himself at Amy’s door empty-handed. Hehad completely forgotten to buy champagne, caviar, flowers, candy,anything. He felt like a total idiot, but it was too late to remedy thesituation. When Amy opened the door, however, she was visibly excited. She grabbed Avery’s hand. She kissed him, pulling him at once intothe dining room. Soft music played in the background. Three tall silvery candles were burning in elegant crystal holders, and sparks of light reflectedfrom the white china and the polished silver. Amy danced at the endof the dining table that she had set, so beautifully, for their dinner.There was a package sitting on the edge of the table. “Fed-Ex delivered it,” she said. “It’s addressed to you.

The scent of delectable food was in the air—hens brown-ing, aromatic rice, and hot bread. Amy is so lovely, Avery thought, and there was a subtle shift in his mood. He was suffused with a sense of well-being, but it madehim, strangely, pause inside. How quickly he moved from mood tomood, state to state. I am an idiot. I am delighted. He wondered ifthere was anything of substance in him, anything immutable. The simple brown-wrapped package bore a plain white label, ad- dressed by hand in florid script, to Avery in care of Amy. There wasno return address. Amy’s hands were fluttering above it, birds seeking to light.“I’ve no idea what it is,” said Avery. He moved closer to Amy put his arm around her waist and breathed in the scent of her.“Open it!” Amy tore away the wrappings, opened the carton.White paper frothed out like champagne bubbles from a fluted glass. Avery’s heart began to pound in his chest. Tingling warmth moved up his spine. “Oh Avery,”breathed Amy,“how sweet!

He leaned over to see what nestled in the froth of paper.

Marie had watched three buses come and go.As people came and waited for the next bus, they glanced at her with curious expressions.None of them approached her, however, and she had the bench toherself. From time to time, she shook her head and wondered why she couldn’t make up her mind to either get on the bus or take herself onup that hill behind her. She noticed that no passengers ever got offthe incoming buses. Perhaps it was a sign that no one really wantedto go up there. Alone again, she turned and looked up the hill. About a quarter mile from where she sat, stood the administrative building of theconvent. A paved, winding driveway led from the road up to the con-vent, and the occasional delivery truck weaved its way up and downas she sat at her post. Marie knew she needed to get on with something—her life, the bus ride, anything. All she managed to do, though, was sit there. Shewas seized with indecision. Should she start walking toward the smallreligious community or climb on the next bus? She was dressed in a shabby coat, which only partially covered well-worn but laundered slacks and tennis shoes. Her hard-sidedsuitcase was on the ground in front of her. Despite the blustery day,her head was bare, revealing short, graying black hair. “I can’t do it, Lord,” she prayed. “I just can’t go there. Please help me.” She knew there was an answer somewhere to her lack of purpose and resolve. She felt sure that those who lived up on that hill would1Wellness.qxd 7/19/03 4:31 PM Page 110"

Up until a few weeks ago, she had been so sure of her faith and the direction this faith would take her.

Soon, she ceased to debate with herself and just let her mind drift with theleaves and dust kicked up by the small whirlwinds that blew past her. After a while, another bus approached. A person got off this time, a young girl about twenty or so. Marie watched as the drivergot out, pulled a good-sized duffel bag from the storage area, andhanded it to the new arrival. The girl picked up her suitcase andlooked up the hill. The bus pulled back into the road and began its slow departure.

The girl sat at the very end of the bench, with her duffel bag on the groundbeside her. As people unconsciously mimic the pose of others, thegirl also sat with shoulders hunched and head hanging. They werelike bench bookends, dual portraits of indecision and misery. After a while, Marie’s curiosity got the best of her. “Are you here to enter the convent?” The response was a nod of the head. Another minute passed, and the girl asked, “Why didn’t you get on the bus?” Marie shrugged. This was a hard one to answer. “It looks like we’re in the same boat,” offered Marie. “Neither of us can make upour minds either to go up the hill or get on the next bus.” The girl looked at her. “With all due respect, ma’am, you seem a little old to be entering convent life.” She reddened as she said this,knowing it was borderline rude, but it was too late to take it back. Marie didn’t take offense. She was feeling every one of her years lately and still remembered how she had looked at older people whenshe was the same age as this youngster. “I’m supposed to begin my aspirancy today,” the girl explained. She went on to clarify to Marie that becoming an aspirant is the veryfirst step in entering religious life. “After a period of time, if thingswork out, the next step is to become a postulant,” she explained asshe gazed up the hill. “Where’s your family?” asked Marie. “This is a big step to go through by yourself.” She knew now that she was the one being bor-derline rude, but she felt an urgency to know what was happeningwith this girl. She tried to soften her question by introducing herself.“My name’s Marie, by the way. I seem to not be in a hurry to go any-where myself today, so we can talk if you want while we both wait forinspiration.” “Oh, they wanted to come all the way, but I wouldn’t let them. I wanted to do this last part of the trip by myself. Mom was real upsetand kept saying, ‘Please Anne, let us take you right up to the door.’But somehow I just wanted to be alone, you know, right before.” “Before?” thought Marie. She was getting the impression that Anne was acting like someone entering jail instead of a convent. Anne, who seemed thankful to have someone to talk to, ex- plained that, now that she was here, on the brink, she was getting coldfeet. She was suddenly afraid to make the trek up that hill, to face thechallenges of convent life. “Well, that makes two of us,” murmured Marie more to herself than to Anne. Barbara Walker1Wellness.qxd 7/19/03 4:31 PM Page 112"

Marie was alarmed now and slid over to be a little closer to her seat-mate. She waited a short while, then handed over her last cleantissue. “Anne, tell me, first of all, what made you decide to join the con- vent. Why did you want to be a part of it?” Anne looked up at Marie and thought about her answer before responding. “It started more as a feeling when I was in high school.I felt a connection. I guess you could say, that was more than some-thing you experience when you’re in church or just praying. I mean,I didn’t hear voices or anything like that, but I’ve always felt morecomplete when I was talking with God. I thought I wanted to spendmy life serving God in the best way I could. But now, I’m not sure.” “So? What’s changed to make you feel now that this may not be for you?” asked Marie. She knew she was addressing her own angstbut couldn’t stop herself. Anne stood up and began pacing in front of their bench.“School came easy to me. I had the best grades, and I made the dean’s listthroughout college, but this, well, I just don’t know. There’s so muchthat’ll be new and different. What if I can’t do it? I mean, what if Idon’t measure up after all?” Marie, having the benefit of years on her side, was pretty good at judging people. She knew that this young woman was intelligent anddetermined, despite her words. “But here you are,” she said.“Y es, here I am,” said Anne.“I did make the trip, but now I’m not exactly sure why.” “Perhaps because your faith kept you going. Without actually thinking about it, your faith was larger than your fears. It helped youget on that bus, and it helped you get off to make your walk up thathill.” Marie felt her own burden begin to lift. “Maybe,” said Anne after a little while. She sat back down and looked at Marie. “Is this faith something that comes to a person asthey get older? How do you know if you have enough faith or if youjust don’t measure up?” “There you go again with the measuring up,” Marie said. “Ask yourself, who is it you want to measure up to? The others up there inthe convent? Y our family? When you think about it, it’s really be-tween you and God.” Marie leaned back now, and for the first time in a long time, felt some of the old peacefulness.1Wellness.qxd 7/19/03 4:32 PM Page 113"

He won’t give me more than I can han- dle.” She looked over at Marie with a smile that lit up her face. “Y es, everyday can be a new test of just how far you can go with God as your partner.” “But we must learn to let go and let God take care of our spiri- tual progress,” finished Marie. Now it was clear to both of them that Marie’s words were for her- self as well as for her young friend. Marie reached over to hug Anne. Just then, another bus came into view. Both women looked at it, then at each other. Without a word, they stood, picked up their lug-gage, and climbed the hill. When they got to the first building, Annestarted up the steps. When Marie didn’t follow, she turned and looked.“Have you changed your mind?” she asked with a note of fear creeping back in. “No. I want to walk a bit more before I go in, that’s all,” replied the older woman.“Y ou go on. I’m sure we’ll see each other in a while.” A few hours later, as part of her entrance into the convent, Anne was ushered into the office of the Mother Superior. She wasn’t look-ing forward to having to talk with this authority figure and was feel-ing intimidated as she approached the large desk for the first time. It was the crown on a day she would never forget, and she un- derstood what the older woman had realized down at the bus stop;God will always help us find a way home. “Welcome, Anne,” said Marie. “Most of the people here refer to me as Mother .... ” A full-time writer following many years of work in social services,   focuses on stories, articles, and essays dealing with the human con- dition.

It was not that I didn’t feel pain. My right hipcreaked with every step. And the small toe on my left foot, which hadblistered the week before, was, from the feel of it, reblistering underthe old callus. When I let my attention roam the nooks and cranniesof my body, there was pain. Mostly, though, I had stopped thinking.My mind was as uncluttered as a monk’s cell. I was all light and birdsong.

My face nuzzledher neck with its soft silky talcum smell. We rocked. Just a glimmer of memory. A moment when I trusted complete- ly. Was it possible at forty-seven to get back to this kind of faith? I opened my eyes for another peek at the vast, turning universe— so steady in its motion. Then I looked up to the tons of stone tower-ing above me—so oblivious to my mortality. If one can still experience awe, maybe faith is recoverable, too, though perhaps not instantaneously. Faith implies a kind of never-ending work, someplace deep, like the bottom of a well, where theblue sky is a faraway circle of color. Faith is the hard and endless workof constant reorientation from choices made in fear to choices madefrom love. But here, now, sheltered beneath the ancient weight ofprecariously balanced stone, anything seemed possible. I had miles to go to reach my designated campsite where I’d pitch my tent and wait for the moon to rise. My warm body had chilled inthe wind. I climbed down and shouldered my pack. A few minuteson the trail, and the arch disappeared from view. I hopped from rockto rock, listened to the dried yucca rattling like a medicine gourd inthe wind. I left the arch to be discovered by whoever came next—anywayfarer whose mind was not preoccupied by too long, too tired, toolate. Anyone whose heart was open to why not.   has spent the last thirty-four years exploring and pho- tographing the far-flung spaces of our planet.

I am struck by the incongruity of beginning a weekend of healing with this blessing in a parking lot. But I know it is the firststrand in the weaving of the circle, a circle encompassing us withinsacred time and space. I close my eyes and feel the mild morning sunon my face, take a few deep breaths, and promise myself to park allexpectations. This overnight workshop is created by Earthwalks for Health, a nonprofit organization to learn traditional ways of healing and be-ing on the land. Entitled “Coyote Fool Moon,” it sounds like a timeof playfulness and surprises. The coyote in Native American tradi-tion is the Trickster—mischievous, cunning, foolish but wise in get-ting us to laugh at our own self-importance. Little do I know whatcoyote has in store for me. Arriving at Buck’s house two hours later, I find that the outside is hot but the inside cool. Rowena and a figure draped in black lacestand in the doorway.“Hello,” I say cheerfully. The tall, hidden figurebows, and Rowena blesses me with a prayer stick. We begin with a game of “Photographer and Camera” by pair- ing up with someone we don’t know. When my partner suggests I bethe camera first, I immediately have to give up my desire to be in con-trol. “Me first?” I gulp, but I surrender and close my eyes. I can’t reach out my hands and find my own boundaries but have to trust my guide to steer me. Hesitant at first, the pressure of herarm around my waist and the low voice giving me explicit instruc-tions enable me to move with confidence. After positioning my bodyand head precisely, she says,“Open,” and I open my eyes to a startlingimage. A snapshot indeed! Each is an unexpected treat, from the Opposite: Francisco Zuniga.

At one point, my eyes open to another couple, one of whom,a friend, is the “camera.” Her eyes are still shut as she is led about, andI laugh heartily. We reverse roles, and I realize how difficult it is to be the guide, to anticipate the rock under her foot before my “camera” steps on it,to get her to “snap” the shot I see so clearly. Steering her back to thehouse, her arm bumps against the door frame, and I know that shehas been more exact and careful with me than I with her, how safe Ihad been. Seated within a circle, I am intrigued by what people have to say. We begin with an introduction of the persons who were our “cam-era.” They state their intention for the weekend and choose a coloredcandle to light. We laugh, muse, find consonance and communionin our desires for relaxation, rest, peace, letting go, change. Ourguides, Rowena and Buck, have hearty laughs. Rowena is soft, ma-ternal, humble, deep. Buck sits solidly as a rock with an inner focusedpeacefulness but also a sense of mischief and playfulness. I mention the transition I am passing through without revealing those details held quietly in my heart, from nanny to writer, fromyouth to menopause, the attempt to manifest my dreams. I am herewith my partner Michael who suffers from acute depression, and Ihope the weekend will alleviate some of the suffering and rejuvenateme. I pick a white candle for divine guidance and peace. Later, whenit is his turn to light a candle, Michael unknowingly relights the sameone that the wind had blown out. After lunch, the work begins. Advised to put on shorts, hats, and sunscreen, we women gather by the river. In groups of three, we arehanded small vials of paint and are instructed to paint on ourselvesthe things we want to release into the river. My group is silent as weform a circle. I am surprised by how many things I want to let go ofand paint both my arms and legs. The men arrive a little later. One of the participants uses a walk- er and is assisted through the willows. While the women are alreadytelling each other the meaning of their images, the men are paintingon themselves and each other. “A different tribe,” I joke and am sud-denly transported back to an ancient ritual of decorating the skin insymbols, ceremonies of puberty rites, marriage, war-making, heal-ing, creating tribal solidarity. Maybe they used dyes from berries andashes from the fire, engraving the symbols with a sharp pointed stick,creating permanent tattoos, or maybe only for the occasion to bewashed away in water and blood. As we tell each other the meaningof our symbols, I am again struck by the consonance. I could havepainted any of the other’s on my own body. Wendy L. Brown1Wellness.qxd 7/19/03 4:32 PM Page 122"

      "text": "After the ritual of washing off the paint, we splash and play in the river. I am content to sit on a rock like a lizard in the sun with my feet in the cool, rushing water, watching peacefully, preparing myselffor the next ceremony—a sweat lodge, an ancient ritual for cleans-ing and purging. I have never participated in an authentic sweat and am torn be- tween trepidation and anticipation. What if I feel suffocated, claus-trophobic, sick from the heat? I don’t easily feel comfortable withstrangers, especially naked male strangers. The rules are not rigid.Wecan step out by saying,“I am called elsewhere”; we can sit close to thedoor, and clothing or nakedness is optional. The sweat lodge is styled“Apache Two Souls,” meaning the male and female, light and shad-ow, are within each of us. My curiosity is piqued. Filipe’s home, an old adobe passed down from his grandmoth- er, has plain brown walls with a few hanging retablos. Kerosenelanterns, handcrafted pots, special rocks, and mementos are on thewindow sills. Through the arched doorways, one can see long tables.Filipe, a potter, is soft-spoken, gentle, centered, earthy, his feet in soft-soled moccasins, his hair pulled back into a ponytail. He tells us thathe is cooking beans and fried bread for us tonight. Usually he leadsthe sweat, but since a large workshop is coming the following day,Hildy, a tall, thin, blond woman with a German accent, will be theleader tonight. She explains in precise detail the working of the sweat,entering and exiting, using sage if you feel overwhelmed by heat, thestages of the ritual. I begin to relax. We undress. Some of the women change into loose saris or wrap- arounds. Around the blazing fire, Hildy and her assistant Lisa brushnegative energy off us one by one, with a feather dipped in smoke.Then she enters the low-built adobe lodge, and we follow. Kneelingto enter, I say,“T o all my relations,” and she hands me a sprig of sage.I choose a place about a fourth of the way around, close to the doorbut not next to it. Michael has chosen not to enter the sweat but tostay outside by the fire. Heated rocks are brought in on a shovel to a deep pit in the earth. The door is shut. We are in total darkness but for a faint glow of theheated rock. Lisa leads us in a simple chant with a drum, blessing theHoly Father and Mother. Hildy prays to the Spirits of the East, theplace of beginnings, which this round is dedicated to. I am alreadysweating profusely. Seated between two young men, listening to the prayers and hiss of steam as water hits the rocks to bring the prayer into spirit form,I feel like an elder with tenderness and compassion for not just thetwo on either side of me but the entire circle.

When the bowl comes to me, I think of many reasons to give thanks and ask for special blessings for my best friend and her daugh-ter, who is fighting heroin addiction, and special blessings for mypartner. The heartfelt sympathy in the circle is almost palpable asHildy tosses water on the rocks to escort my blessing heavenwards oras steam to fall back upon us. At the end of the first round, I step out, rinse myself with cold water, and join others around the fire. Buck and Filipe are fire-tenders. Others who decided not to do the sweat are holding the en-ergy for us as we emerge. The night is beautiful. Sometimes gentleraindrops fall; sometimes the wind picks up. Behind a restless cloudysky, the full moon is rising. Coyote moon. I squat by the fire, con-tinuing my prayers in silence, feeling wild, organic, and free. Aftereach round, more people crawl out of the sweat. The firelight glis-tens on their softened bodies. Their faces are filled with firelight andjoy. I doze off and awaken to Filipe inviting people to come and eat.A feast awaits us of beans, fried bread, and chili, as well as chicken,green salad, coleslaw, watermelon, potato salad, and lemonade. Iserve a peach cobbler I brought. Later I tackle the dishes, Filipe’sgrandmother’s assortment, and immediately am joined by threewomen from our workshop. We work quickly and efficiently as ateam, but it is two in the morning before we crawl into our sleepingbags. The morning starts slowly. Under the blazing moon I haven’t slept well and am grateful for the cup of coffee Michael brings. I dipa bit of leftover cake into it. We gather to share the impact of the pre-vious night’s sweat. Everyone looks relaxed, radiant, in a state ofgrace. Then Buck elaborates on the next part of our journey, themedicine wheel. He and Hildy built it by intuition, resembling a labyrinth or the wheel of fortune tarot card. It is for us to experience individually aswe wish. One quadrant represents Father and another Father’sAncestors, across is Mother and Her Ancestors. Beyond them, theLittle Boy and Little Girl, and behind, the Warrior and Warrioress.He explains how all of these archetypes are in each of us. “Walk towhere you feel pulled to go,” he explains. “Y ou may want to speak toan aspect of yourself.Y ou can do all the wheel or only parts.”We dressin ritual garments, T-shirts with saris or skirts. I have brought a pur-ple T-shirt with coyotes on it and a special piece of silk fromThailand. Michael’s hesitation about going down to the wheel andhis exhaustion keep him from joining us. I move down to the wheel,picking up two small stones on the way. Wendy L. Brown1Wellness.qxd 7/19/03 4:32 PM Page 124"

Once again we enter an altered state beyonddefinition, beyond time and space. I am a little tired and disoriented as I approach the quadrant of Father and drop a heart-shaped stone. I have never felt close to myfather’s side of the family. But I choose to honor them, thankingthem for their heritage of hard work, honesty, and humility. Then,thinking I will proceed to the Mother’s side, the wheel leads me else-where. I notice the careful pilings of rocks, tiny yellow snapdragons,a design that seems organic and flowing and not like labyrinths I havewalked before. I kneel in a circle that speaks to me from theWarrioress. Instantly an image comes to mind of a butterfly crawl-ing out of its cocoon and straddling a leafy twig. I know if the but-terfly doesn’t dry its wings, it won’t be able to fly and will die. I thinkof how strong I need to be to take care of myself, to protect the frag-ile delicacy of the emerging butterfly, and at the same time to takecare of my partner. I begin to weep, softly at first, then from whatfeels like a deep well, grief, fear, and pain come pouring out. Whatfeels like an endless rain of tears falls onto Mother Earth. Eventually I leave the wheel to sit in the shade of a tall cotton- wood tree. A dog that followed us from Felipe’s home lies at my feet,as if to protect me. I touch her soft fur for comfort. Buck leads us in a mediation of the wheel. He then invites us to act out some of our experiences of the wheel, speaking from thecharacter we encountered. I find myself standing up and, in betweensobs, speak my truth. It is the first time I have admitted my vulner-ability to others. I always project the Warrioress image of strength,courage, and hopeful optimism. I say aloud, “I know my faith is un-shakable. But I need to learn to receive as well as give.” I describe theimages that came to me and my process as unfolding “uncontrol-lably.” I have an empathetic listening audience. Simply heard. Able tofinish the words without interruption. What a gift. When I amthrough, Buck smudges me in a benediction with the smoking sage.When I sit down, Rowena tells me that a large monarch butterfly flut-tered behind me as I spoke. We finish our meditative storytelling with a prayer and a song, one that stays in my head for days, and then walk back to the house.We conclude our last circle by describing briefly our experience atthe wheel. Then we take our candle and bless ourselves as we blow itout. Ours is already blown out again, and I relight it and explain howit keeps going out and getting relit. Michael blows it out, receivingthe blessing. Coyote Fool Moon1Wellness.qxd 7/19/03 4:32 PM Page 125"

Amazingly enough, it takes us four hours to get home, making stopsand veering off on a scenic route to avoid a traffic pileup. A stormwhips up, plunging us in a downpour that cleanses the car, the high-way, the earth. I am cleansed and feel lightheaded for days. And yet, I feel somehow incomplete, restless, uneasy.

I contemplate the messages of transformation and resurrection in the symbols that were around me during the Earthwalk weekend.I realize they were to help me understand not just the changes tak-ing place in my own life, but also my heart’s understanding of the ul-timate mysteries.

Y esterday, a thirty-year-old student wept in my office, griev-ing the death of his brother—shot by a rival drug dealer. Althoughhis three brothers deal and use heavy drugs, Jamal has been clean fora year. He wipes his eyes and breathes deeply, manfully, to controlhimself.“They’re all going to be dead soon! This is my second broth-er killed.” Jamal abandoned gang life to attend college. He plannedto disappear and reappear, as a new person. He sold his expensiveclothes, stereo, guns, and glittering ground-effects car to finance hiseducation. Now he washes his clothes in the kitchen sink, eats at soupkitchens, and fears he will not have enough money to scrape throughhis final semester. Another student who embeds herself in my thoughts is Pamela, with her two chronically ill children. Her daughter with sickle-cellanemia requires emergency trips to the hospital every few weeks. Herthirteen-year-old son has had a colostomy and must wear a bag tocontain his uncontrollable waste functions. A schoolyard fall or apunch to the stomach could kill him. Y et she sends him out each daybecause she will not allow him to disappear into institutions. “Myboy’s going to live as much as anybody in this world!” she told me.“If he dies tomorrow, at least he’s going to live first.” Pamela is a su-perb student—hungry to learn and to improve everything shedoes—but her hands shake like leaves about to drop. Her flesh hasshrunken in the struggle to obey her hard will. This week I advisedher to ease off her volunteer counseling for rape victims. If she be-came seriously ill from her frenetic pace, how would her husbandand children manage? “But it’s important!” she protested. “Thesewomen have no one. They’re suicidal.” “Are you?” I asked.That made her grin.“I’ve got an ulcer. I put my worry there; that way I know where it is.” Violence is routine among my students. One class was talking about a shooting yesterday when I entered the room. A half-dozenof them were riding a city bus as gang gunfire erupted in the street,and the bus driver—like some old Gaby Hayes stagecoach hand—kicked the diesel horses into high speed and careened around a cor-ner to escape. My students dove to the floor of the bus and used theirbook bags for shields. “My math textbook’ll stop anything,” one boysaid. Some of them laughed nervously; others clenched their jawsand stared grimly ahead. After class, as I sat in my office and watched the honking traffic and bustling pedestrians pass below, I thought, how can any of usachieve enlightenment in such a world?

That thought jarred me awake at five a.m. T eaching ismy vocation, but today is one of those mornings when I know I amno Buddha, no wise rabbi. I lack the inner peace my students so des-perately need from me. My monkey mind chatters with scenarios offailure. Jamal will lapse into drugs or be shot; Pamela will drop outto tend her son who will die and devastate her. A college educationis thin armor against such threats. That is why I’m at the pond now. T eachers have often come to water to look into themselves and learn. Budh, the root word of the great teacher’s title, means “to awaken” but also “to fathom a depth,penetrate to the bottom.” I hope to learn from my water, disappearinto it for a while and reappear. Like my shrunken pond that will fillin spring, like my students who dare to remake themselves, a teachermust be reborn each season. It promises to be a great day to be reborn. T oday, late October at dawn in upstate New Y ork, it’s sixty degrees. Sixty! I should bask inthis rare gift from the weather, absorb it into my bones. As the sunrises, the shrunken pond reflects the trees’ reds and golds and theether blue sky. The still water captures even the flutters of leaves. I envy the pond’s calm and purity of reflection because my own mind is more like the pond in spring when the surface ripples androils. Silvery bass leap into the air for insects and slap back down.Their rings spread to the farthest edges, then roll back to the center.And, of course, there are water snakes—fat, four-feet long, and nasty.They swim with heads high, watching me—unafraid, perhaps wish-ing their mouths were larger. I suppose every pond must have a snakeor two, just as each heart must. But there are other demons in my little paradise too. Just a few months ago as a mallard family paddled across the pond, six veesspreading behind the adults and fluffy chicks, the last chick in linepopped under water and disappeared. No peep, no thrashing marredthe surface. I glimpsed the yellow-streaked face beneath the water.Turtles drag chicks by the foot to the bottom to drown and eat them.The parent ducks did not even notice. They do not count chicks orname them. But I do count my students and sometimes know themtoo well. They are stalked daily, and even this early in the semester,some have begun to disappear. Latoya, James, Natalie, Ramon. Theirghostly faces rise in my dreams as if from under water. Let the pond’s stillness teach me something better I can bring to the city. Most people, I suspect, often wish for such a day’s purepeace. If everything would just be still so we could concentrate! If wecould just be what we might be without interference.

I confess I’ve had more than most humans’ fairshare of quiet—a dozen summers free from work’s turtles to thinkabout “higher” things. Magazine assignments have let me kayak onfoggy lakes at dawn and stand alone in a Caribbean rain forest be-side a waterfall with only Arawak ghosts for company and call it“work.”Y et here I am, as unsettled as a harried case-worker or stock-broker. The truth may be that our most distracting noise is ourselves,and, if we skim off the noise, we may disappear with it. Over the centuries, teachers and others have withdrawn to lone- ly deserts, mountains, and ponds to prepare themselves to reenter theworld—seven days beside the water under Buddha’s tree of life. Y etwhile Buddha meditated there, he was beset by a squalling demonthat tried furiously to distract him from tranquility and under-standing. This demon I take to be his own mind. He had to wrestpeace from the noise inside himself. Only then did he become thegreat teacher. That is what I must learn. I squat on the hardened mud shore to examine the water more closely. On the bottom, leaves have settled into brown ooze to be ab-sorbed into next year’s pond weeds. It is a model for transformation.I bend my face nearer the water to study the leaves below, furry withsilt. There, an inch-long mayfly nymph rolls a dead leaf into a tubearound itself for winter. In spring, it will emerge, rise to the surface,and fly. It seems like another lesson—teachers must be shape-shiftersto help others transform themselves. We must change from the in-side out if we are to leave the mud and enter the air. As I mull thisover, I spot a dragonfly nymph hunting the mayflies under water. Ittoo will grow wings under its chitin shell this winter and fly nextspring. When it locates a mayfly, the dragonfly unrolls the leaf andseizes the nymph about the middle with powerful jaws. The mayflytwitches feebly as the dragonfly eats it. There is going to be more tothis than I thought. Enlightenment doesn’t come in safe doses. In one of those magical optical revelations, my eyes adjust, and I realize I have been staring at the silty bottom right through the im-age of the moon floating like a lily pad on the water’s surface. I glanceover my shoulder to the moon in the sky—as faded and unreal as itswatery image. Surely it must be even more serene and still than mylittle pond. No wind stirs the human footprints left in its dustdecades ago. No pond dragons or snakes squirm there. No messylives, no industry, no war shatters the lunar silence.

That is a neat trick—to transform utter holocaust into ethereallight. But what if we look at the earth from space too? What of our tur- bulent, teeming masses and their teeth-clenching pain? Our blue-and-white globe floats in a quiet pond too—the Milky Way—whosemillions of suns and planets, like a thin strand of algae, barely dis-turb the vast pools of space. From such a perspective, the sun’s vio-lent fits are mere twinkles on the water, and the earth’s convulsionsand my students’ miseries no more than protoplasm streaming in acell. Once in a while, a supernova ripples the weeds in a far corner.Otherwise, we scarcely notice the magnificent silence of light yearsaround us, so deafened are we by our own petty noises. If I could enlarge my mind, I might see the violence of my stu- dents’ lives from such a perspective. The moon and sun, the leavesand pond, the flesh and blood, and the grief and rapture of humansrise and fall in seasons, in endless death and rebirth. Just like quietand noise. If we have noise now, we will have quiet later. A quiet pondnow, a raucous city later. We who are living are each the single survivor of hundreds of eggs and millions of sperm. Each of us has won a lottery against in-credible odds. Perhaps we ought simply to be thankful for the priv-ilege of crossing the emptiness to hear and feel anything. I will re-member this when Pamela phones me with a question from the hos-pital where she’s writing her next paper while her moaning daugh-ter endures an excruciating blood transfusion to treat her anemia. Iwill celebrate her energy and defiance of silence, not pity her. T o feelanything is a gift. Jamal fears he has AIDS from years of drug abuse but cannot bring himself to be tested. Perhaps I should remind my-self that he is lucky to have lived at all. That all the living die, and allthe dead will be reborn. Should I tell him the great quiet will come,and there will be no more threats or lost brothers? I must give himsomething from this glorious dawn. The sun pushes its glittering fingers through the tree branches and the moon is evaporating, almost gone. Gone? That thoughtsnaps me to greater attention. No. It will still be there, although I willnot see it when the sun beats the sky like a drum. The moon will sim-ply be invisible, disappear. Even on the other side of the earth, themoon is still there. The cycle of day and night exists only in our lim-ited human perception. The sun shines steadily every hour of everyday; night exists only behind the earth’s shadow. Just as we createdarkness when we block the light.

When I talk with them later, what I haveseen here will light my words, even if I say nothing about this dawnexcursion. This morning light will illuminate all the shadows I stepinto—or cast—today. So here is a conclusion: There are no irrelevant noises, no dis- tractions, and we have no pure self that can live separately from whatsurrounds us. My discomfort this dawn may simply be reluctance toallow my students’ noise and pain into my quiet country life. I wantto continue to think of myself as one who escaped the ghetto. But Imistake the cure for the sickness. T o be separate is not to be safe butrather to be most in danger, most ripe for misery. This is not easy tosay when one cherishes solitude as much as I do. But when I acceptthe noise of Jamal and Pamela’s pain and my own, I believe I will hearthe quiet. Beside a half-dead maple tree—one side holed by woodpeckers, the other hung with yellow leaves tipped scarlet—I sit in the sunnygrass. It will serve me as well as Buddha’s Bodhi tree. The moon hasmelted into the sunlight. I lie back and breathe in the balmy breeze—the breath of summer in the mouth of winter. These same moleculeshave passed through the lungs of the great teachers. I inhale it so Ican breathe it out later, in the city. I do not know yet what I will tellmy students or how exactly I have changed, but we will learn togetherand then forget together, for knowledge disappears and reappearsthe way pond, moon, seasons, and humans do. Jamal and Pamelateach me to embrace risk and transformation, to treat education asthe adventure it is, to grasp at this fleeting life with passion. For themoment at least, I know that even the pain is full of wonder and luck,and that each day offers a thousand joys we pass by as we seek ourmisery. Perhaps I can help my students to see and listen better for thejoys. The whining buzz of cicadas, squirrels arguing over a hickorynut, the din of a class debating the needle-exchange program, andthe furor of hospitals and gangs stir like fetuses within the womb ofquiet. Y et underneath, new silences incubate. Noise is the shadow ofstillness, and stillness the shadow of noise. It is dawn now and timeto go. I return the invisible moon’s smile and breathe slowly.

One day when there was not a single scrap, not a loaf left, an old man with two sold us one of his, patting Nico’s cheek.

The sailor’s Slavic, almost good as my Sign, convinced the owner to give me yesterday’s fragrant-wood-burning-stone-oven-baked bread.

Long tables of food, water, soda, and even cake had been set upfor all who were in need. These items came from the hospital, next-door neighbors, and coffee shops. I was feeling sorry for myself as I found no one to raise from the dead. Just then, I ran into both my old friend, Father Roger, and anew friend and co-worker, Father Damien, who was from some is-land, the name of which I don’t recall. He was a bishop, completewith ring and staff, yet insisted on simply being called “Father.” Thethree of us became attached at the hip. Father Roger told us weshould go to the New School, just two blocks away, where relativeswere being interviewed to find lost loved ones. After some time, we went back to the front of the hospital but found the same scene of prayerful waiting. The horrific reality wecould hear across a pocket radio had not yet been revealed or real-ized in this place. As a priest, I have often said that I do not chase after an ambu- lance to save a person’s soul. But God winked, and low and behold,a big white-and-yellow ambulance pulled up right in front of mewith the backdoors wide open. No one was inside. I asked the driver,“Where is the patient?” He said they had been delivered to the waiting doctors. He was to take back fresh supplies for a new triage site. Father Damien looked at me and said, “Let’s go where the souls need us.” I said, “Father, you are out of your head. I am seventy-one and a recovering heart-attack patient. Y ou are using a cane.” I had to thinkfast. Do I really believe what I preach? Do I want to walk the walk orjust talk the talk? I looked at Father Damien. He was smiling, andthen I smiled too, as little boys do. I said, “Let’s do it.” In the tradition of those who go into battle, we blessed each oth- er. Some young medical students pushed us into the ambulance, upover boxes of bottled water, masks, candy, apples, and bandages. I lis-tened as the others in the ambulance told me how to put on a dustmask and about the danger in front of us. I asked, “Is this any way totreat an old priest?” The ride down to what was to become known as “ground zero” was slow, rough, and jolting. The street was covered with debris, steel,and rock fragments. The air was quickly contaminated with pungent,unfamiliar, scatological odors of destruction. My remembrance ofthe killing fields in Korea, though, caused me to identify that uni-versal smell—death. In the Blink of an Eye Opposite: Bernice Cross Stone Angel.

I realized this human experi-ence might be tough, but it just might work for me. God’s next wink happened when I entered the first grade at Saint Monica School. I was under the control of eight nuns for eight years.Each had two hands, but within the right hand was the growth of atwelve-inch, light-brown ruler. Each inch was named after an apos-tle of Jesus Christ. Now that scared me. The next wink of God was when my very best friend in eighth grade told me I must go with him to the first seminary establishedin America by the French Holy Cross Father Isaac, a place then-con-nected with the University of Notre Dame at South Bend, Indiana. Iwas to be a priest. I thought this would be great for me, as Jesus wassweet, and his Holy Father would not be like my own heavy-handedfather. So off we went to the “Angel Factory.” It was not very differ-ent from my parental environment, which was stern, secretive, and aplace where I remained under surveillance at all times. Father HolyRector and the twelve priest teachers morphed, just like those sacrednuns of earlier days, into my German father. It would be impossiblefor me to ever give witness of them smiling, laughing, crying, or giv-ing a nod of approval to me or to anything else outside of themselves.“O God, save me, from these holy and pure men.” Y ou guessed it, God winked, and I audaciously climbed over the seminary wall. Within two weeks, my government informed me thatthe military exemption for the seminary had ended. I was expectedto defend and protect my country from communist Korea. Theyplaced me in the U.S. Air Force. They thought it made sense. I hadbeen educated in an “Angel Factory”; therefore, I should fly. My soul was in torment. How can I kill God’s grandest creation? In a bomber, I will be an angel of death—not of life. This thoughtbecame a moral ethic that would stay with me all my life. I earnedU.S. Air Force medals, but the big ribbon for good conduct was theone that made me laugh.With eight nuns, twelve priests, and my par-ents, what else but good could come from me? After four years, I was released from active duty in the air force. That last night, as an airman, I had a restless sleep, full of dreamsabout liberation and personal freedom. No more killing. No “yes, sir”or “no, sir.” No more taking orders. I would be in control of my lifeat last. Looking back through the years, I now understand why I chose to be a biblical prodigal son.

Y es, I became a song-and-dance man. “Look out world,” I said, “I am in control.” As a government-paid student in the American Theaters Wing, it was exciting to perfect my natural talents. But with my backgroundof the military, seminary, nuns, and my over-vigilant parents, I wastoo much a scrupulous prude. I never got a big part. I thought I wasa failure. So I looked for a wink from God. But I guess a prodigal sondoes not experience a “god wink.” It was degrading to be recognizedas a failure. So, I just trolled the streets of life, taking jobs that did notneed my skills or faith. Quickly I became overqualified for every twelve-step program there was. After a few years, God winked again. It was a dark, cold,wintry night. I was in the only place I felt secure, accepted, and un-derstood: my usual bar with my only true friend, Bob the bartender.During one of our often politically incorrect diatribes, Bob informedme that I knew nothing about the history of Constantinople or theOrthodox Christian Religion of Eastern Europe. Bob was correct. Sothe next night, along with a free beer, came two four-inch-thickbooks on the Byzantine Empire. This was the next wink of God. I had held a secret throughout those years, unknown even to my few friends: I had taken extension courses in Christian Theology,Metaphysics, Comparative Religions, Psychology, and SpiritHealing. These studies were more than would be required of anypriest, but I never planned to do anything professional with them. God winked again. This time, an Orthodox bishop was talking to me and told me I must be called to the priesthood. My reply was“Not me, I’m a prodigal son.” The bishop replied sternly, “Good! They make the best priests.”About a year later, I found myself somewhere in Lower Manhattan walking the cold streets. It was noon. I had just left afriend’s loft where fifty of us had drunk through the previous night.The only thing we had in common was drinking, and we shared nobelief in anything but our own self-importance. I had been the lastto leave. I had only one dollar in my pocket and a big need to find atoilet. I may have been drunk, but the real pain was inside my soul. Itruly believed what I had studied, what I had starved and sacrificedto learn about during the hidden, secretive years of research into “reallife.” Who would believe me? How could I teach or use what I hadlearned? I came upon a small, narrow, four-story building centeredin a block-long parking lot. It was painted pure white and had onewooden door with a small wooden cross on top. There was a smallsign on the outside of the building with words written in a foreignlanguage. But I recognized the words “church” and “Saint Nicholas.”Just then, the door opened and out came a lady who smiled at me as In the Blink of an Eye1Wellness.qxd 7/19/03 4:32 PM Page 143"

It was so rich in color, smells,bells, and the bright icons of people of wholeness—the saints. Notone human spoke to me, but in English I clearly heard: “Y ou are mypriest forever.” I cried and quickly left the church in disbelief. I mustbe nuts. Another year later, I was ordained an Orthodox priest and monastic missionary to the “unchurched.” I would go to these peo-ple wherever God called me. The poor, sick, and socially rejected callme “Father” and request the sacraments. I do my best with no fi-nancial support.

We climbed out and into a vortex of ghoulish gray dust, made up of a trillion computer papers, plastic lunch bags, and very personal ef-fects. The dust was in and on all the trees, buildings, crushed fire andemergency trucks, and thousands of private cars. The firemen withtheir hooligan hooks looked like distorted, uniformed charactersfrom Mars. In twenty-two minutes, I too was covered: my robes, myhair, and inside my mouth. I never knew there was a taste to terror:the dust of the world’s largest outdoor crematory. A medical student called us over to an open space under a ledge formed by the overhang of a damaged building. An abandonedhooligan hook was shoved into a very large crack to hang the pre-cious bags of saline solution which were used to wash out the fineground contaminants which blind the eyes. We received our firstwalking but sight-impaired firemen. I went out into the area and pulled on one fireman’s coat sleeve and ordered him to follow me to our triage. The firemen walked insmall, supportive groups, so, if I got one, I got them all. I demandedthey remove their dirty, dusty helmets and form a single line. I said,“Close your eyes,” and I washed their dirt-caked faces. Then I said,“Open your eyes,” and I washed their eyes out. I gave them a bottleof water, an apple, or a candy bar. It was their choice. During theseclose, intimate face-to-face relationships, as a mother to her baby, Isaw their faces as the incarnate Christ. Their eyes, eyes of eternal life,reflected a litany of death, loss, hope, helpless courage, and a terrorbeyond feelings.

As the firemen walked back to their dangerous workwith renewed vision and untangled souls, I received their benedic-tus, “God bless you, Father.” Then it happened, a message came from my God in the form of an angel. This good-looking man stood right in front of FatherDamien and myself and said, without introduction, “Follow me butstay within my light. I’ll take you to the morgue.” Father Damian looked to me and said, “How could he know what we really came down here to do?” I was impressed with the the stranger’s cleanliness, especially his shoes. No one there had clean shoes. The angel moved fast. His lightilluminated our path in front of us yet also behind him. We stum-bled along in his very large circular light for five blocks in that mor-bid atmosphere of manmade cosmic destruction. Suddenly, both the angel and his light disappeared. We were in front of the large doors of a dark, damaged building. There was onlya small generator supplying light on the inside of what seemed to bethe elegant lobby of a café from another time. As I stood there, I heard and saw a very old, black, dirty, long re- frigerator truck: a temporary morgue. It’s driver stood next to it. Thiselectrical mausoleum was surrounded by firemen standing and sit-ting. They were tired, dejected, and overwhelmed by the magnitudeof destruction and death, all of them focusing on the dirty truck. AsFather Damian and I came closer, some of the firemen came to us,offering the salutation, “God bless you, Fathers.” They escorted us tothe small, rickety platform that raised us to the truck’s flooring. Theirflashlights helped us to see the red body bags. We loudly intoned theancient prayer for the dead. They told us not to open the bags, mak-ing it sound as if the bags contained a secret. As we departed thatscene of reverence and respect, I heard a chorus of a deep-toned,“God bless you, Father.” Just then the angel made another welcomed appearance and silently directed us to once again walk in his light. The angel’s cleanlight led us into the dark, dusty café lobby. We slowly shuffled ourway through debris, passing rescue workers and large tables of wa-ter, apples, and those big candy bars. Y oung men and women wereserving it all with a smile. As we passed them, they smiled and said,“God Bless you, Father.” We continued in our faithfulness to the an-gel’s light.

I saw two adult acolytes approaching in a short procession,their hands carrying the offering for a liturgy: a sacrifice to God.Sanity took over. I knew, and quickly had to accept, that coming intothis place, soon to be consecrated with blood, were firemen. They re-spectfully placed a long basket in front of me on the table. It heldwhat looked like parts of a large, broken child’s doll. Then I heardone fireman in his tearful voice, sounding like a deacon to me, say,“Bless! Father.” He walked back for more. In this most unusual andexceptional moment of earth’s history, I found myself standing alonedoing what I thought some human would do for me, treat the re-mains of my body as the container of my soul. I blessed the bodyparts and placed them into the bags. Here I was in a catacomb of adestroyed civilization, at an altar-table of the sacrificed. After a long time, there were no more baskets of body offerings, just the incense of decay.A very intrusive, loud, and demanding voicejolted me back into the world of human authority and fear. It wasFather Damien walking toward me with a tall policeman in pursuit,telling him he could not be in here for this was a crime scene. FatherDamian stopped and turned, placing his old gold-ended cane in theofficer’s chest, and said as only a saintly priest could say, “Crimescene? This is God’s scene.” The officer left us alone. The angel madean unexpected reappearance and told us it was time to return to ourtriage center. It seemed to be daybreak with more rescue workers andclergy arriving. Back at the triage, a fireman whom I had prayed with the night before came to me with his helmet in his hand and said, “Father, lastnight you wanted to know if St. Nick’s Church was okay. I have to tellyou that it is destroyed, down to the ground.”He saw me cry and heldme in his strong, supportive arms. The ambulance from St. Vincent’scame by, and the driver offered to take us back to the hospital. After a hot shower and a light meal, we ran into Father Roger again. We told him what we had experienced. He wanted to go backdown again. So we did, this time in a FEMA bus. We arrived at the same triage site and started all over again. We even went back to thatmausoleum. It was the same scene but with even more firemen, andall three of us stood at the truck which was now full, and we blessedthe bodies.

On that long walk back to civilization, I made a sacred vow to God, the blessed Trinity, and to St. Nicholas:I would return to Ground Zero on the very spot where the Churchof St. Nicholas stood and give public praise with prayer, smells, bells,candles, and thanksgiving to St. Nicholas. This church was the samespot where, twenty some years ago, God called me to the priesthood.I vowed to proclaim God’s grace on all my “firemen of God” and myangel, wherever he may be. Praise God, I did it. Four months later,on the eve of St. Nicholas’ saint’s day, with the help of New Y ork CityPolice Officer Lee of the 1st Precinct, I was able to keep my vow. I gave this report to my bishop, just last week. My bishop said, “Now! Do you trust God? Hundreds of firemen spoke to you for Godand said ‘God bless you, Father.’How can you even doubt your priest-hood or the need for you as His priest?” Right then in my ear, Godwinked. I understood at last. I am a priest forever. Thank you, God,and bless your messengers, the police and firemen, at that place thatFather Damian named “God’s scene.” True! It was all in a wink ofGod’s Eye.        still resides in that inner desert of chaotic Manhattan.

T ogether they examined the vegetative nervoussystem of each child still standing in place, measuring the cardiacrhythm, the capillary flux of the fingers, the electric resistance of theskin, as well as the respiratory rate. Attaching electrodes to theirskulls, they took improvised electroencephalograms. With all of thisdata now passed through the central computer, the following diag-nosis was reached: the patients were suffering from sympathetic hy-pertonia, a state of mental and physical alertness of extreme and dan-gerous intensity. Their cardiac rhythm attained a rate of 150–180pulsations per minute as opposed to 67–75 in a normal, healthy in-dividual. T ests made to the children’s skin showed a complete ab-sence of cutaneous resistance to stimuli, proving them to be com-pletely insensitive to their surroundings, in sum, a phenomenonknown to the People’s scientists as the alpha state. Kneeling down at the children’s level, trying to incline his head at the same angle, Lopakhin found himself staring at the rim of the“sarcophagus.” He wanted to be able to read their thoughts, to seewith their eyes, yet nothing was visible to him but an empty sky.Besides, supposing there were something up there, the defunct tow-er being some forty meters high, it would have been impossible forthe children to see it from the ground. Y et Lopakhin was determinedto watch as long as they were watching. It was several hours beforehe saw it. Lopakhin first thought what he saw was an optical illusion, but then it was very distinct in the lenses of his high-powered binocu-lars: a small bird, nothing more than a finch, flying round and roundthe rim of the tower, swooping and buckling, finally fluttering andplunging into the dead heart of the immense chimney. While packing the children into the ambulance to transport them to the military hospital, Lopakhin saw hundreds of dusty pil-grims coming in the opposite direction. Why had the guards notturned them back at the checkpoint? A jeep full of soldiers followed,shouting warnings through a megaphone, but they moved at so swifta pace that no force could stop them. Only when they passed the areawhere most of them used to live did they turn their eyes away fromthe forward path. Several of the women began to wail and rush at theelectrified fence but were stopped by others and dragged along in thedirection of the towers.

Viktor Kalinin knew each of these people by name and counted most of them amongst the inhabitants of the collective farm he ad-ministered. He himself had overseen the emergency re-housing andmade sure that the new crop of orphans was fed by each family in ro-tation. Among them he noticed now several of the local “idiots,”pos-sessed by invisible demons, with long beards and eyes spinning likelittle birds in their shaven heads. Once forbidden to read from scrip-tural texts, these men now recited verses from a language no People’santhropologist could decipher, making Kalinin’s task of integratingthem into the workforce a herculean one. But it was only when he saw the solitary onion hanging around the necks of numerous pilgrims that he began to understand. TheRussian sinner knows that he must keep an onion about him at alltimes by which the Holy Virgin can pull him up into heaven at themoment of his death. Viktor Kalinin, however, was more alarmed by the loss of a day’s work than by the Holy Virgin of Chernobyl. For years, productionquotas had been steadily decreasing, ever since the peasants wereforced to farm land that had not been theirs since birth.

What’s more, readings taken from the three towers of the functioning reac-tors were suddenly inferior to those taken at No. 4. So, with dozens of armed squadrons ringing the kneeling pil- grims, eagerly awaiting the command to disperse them, Lopakhinasked for five minutes to address the crowd. He spoke to themthrough a microphone in one of the army vehicles, explaining thatwhile science was powerless to determine the exact shape of whatthey claimed to be seeing, it could nonetheless prove that high levelsof Cesium 137 in strong concentrations, although invisible and col-orless, might just, given an unusual angle of solar rays, produce akind of dance of particles filtered through ordinary dust carried onthe air. Given certain atmospheric irregularities, it was not outsidethe providence of scientific law that certain visible, though incoher-ent, phenomena could result. Ergo: the Holy Virgin of Chernobylwas nothing more than a smattering of errant atomic particles and,as such, could perform no miracles. When this wisdom failed to move them, the command was giv- en for the military to sweep the pilgrims from the site. Saddened bythe inexplicable failure of pure reason, Lopakhin went back to hislaboratory, as the jeeps started up their engines. From his window,he was just in time to see the three children, not exactly climbing, butbeing borne up the concrete side of the giant reactor tower as if oninvisible ropes, higher and higher until reaching the rim, then suckedsuddenly, as if by aspiration, one hundred feet down into the deadheart of the “sarcophagus,” causing dozens of birds to shoot out of itinto the air, as out of an erupting volcano, spinning into formationand winging out over the Dead Zone.  -    so many of the pilgrims before being overrun.

A quiet, unobtrusive presence,Quakers have lived in New Y ork City since the 1650s. Early Englishconverts were beaten and jailed. When John Bowne, one of theirleaders, was fined and imprisoned, he appealed to the Dutch WestIndies Company. Its directors ordered that colonists be allowed toworship as they pleased. This was the first statement of religious free-dom in America. Over the centuries, Quakers here have been active in abolition- ism, education, feminism, and prison work. Currently they operateBrooklyn Friends School; Friends Seminary, also a school; theFriends Cemetery in Prospect Park; the Fifteenth Street Meetinghomeless shelter; and Friends House in Rosehill, a residence for AIDS victims. Perhaps five hundred members belong to the nine meetingsor Worship Groups (fledgling meetings) within the city’s bound-aries; probably twice that many attend without formal membership. Quakers from Fifteenth Street Meeting, the group in the East Village, have organized the vigil. I glance down our line. I know manyof the people here. Most are Friends; some are not. A few appearedto have simply wandered up and joined us.

Arthur, an older man, craggy, in an old seersucker suit, walksover and stands with us, leaning heavily on his cane. Quaker nonviolence has been sparked by its practice of silent worship. Friends believe that God inspires them to speak and act inthese quiet times. They call it the Inner Light or that of God within.A typical meeting for worship involves anywhere from a few to sev-eral hundred people gathered for an hour. Every so often someoneoffers a short message. Over the years, I have felt led to become involved in the world from the Inner Light, this something stirring inside me duringQuaker worship. It prompts me to take part in the vigil, this Worshipin Action.

Wefounded the Alternatives to Violence Program that teaches conflictresolution in schools and prisons, for example. And we’ve been hold-ing a silent vigil at the Arch on and off since the Vietnam War.” My attention wanders. I inspect a pair of buildings looming over us to the left and right: light-gray One Fifth Avenue and dark-brownTwo Fifth Avenue. The sky darkens; pigeons flutter onto the cornicesof the townhouses opposite them. I zip up my light, black jacket toward off the chill and lean back against the chain-link fence sur-rounding the weather-beaten Arch. As people stroll by, they glance at our signs, respectful, curious. Occasionally one stops to speak to Margery, who has been delegatedto answer questions, or takes a flyer from her. Some drivers honk or wave. At a past vigil, a young man pranced up and down in front of the line, chanting,“I know you want to speak! I know you want to speak!I know you want to speak!” During another one, Y oko Ono and herfriend Sam Havadtoy walked south on Fifth Avenue toward us. Onostared suspiciously, studied a sign, then smiled and blew us a kiss. A few raindrops spatter my old tennis shoes. A tourist snaps our picture, then moves on.

New Y ork City Quakers no longer dress like the Quaker Oats man or speak the plain language (“thou,”“thee,” and so on) like GaryCooper and Dorothy McGuire in the movie Friendly Persuasion.Most dress simply, though, and some use the plain language with oneanother. They’re used to people thinking that their religious societyis extinct or that they’re Amish. What makes New Y ork City Friends especially unique is their at- tempt to live as an oasis of calm in a frenetic city. They treasure theirstillness. Even when Quakers are in conflict, their tradition urges areturn to a cool, meditative center. It’s a quietude born not of apathyor creed but of rock-hard conviction: to be continually aware of thepresence of God. With my many everyday commitments, it’s a hard struggle to stay within that stillness. What helps me, though, is the Quaker tes-timony of simplicity.
