      "text": "The Lord, in his divine compassion, has enabled me to understand the inner meaning of the Bible. This meaning contains deeply hidden secretswhich no one has ever had the slightest conception of before now. Itwould be impossible to understand them without knowing what the otherlife is like, since this is what most of the Bible’s inner meaning refers toand describes. Now, however, I can tell about what I have heard and seenwhile I have been with spirits and angels during the last few years. I realizethat many people will say it is not possible for anyone to talk with spiritsand angels while still living in the physical body. Some will say I am hal-lucinating, and some will say I am writing these things just to get a fol-lowing. Others will make other objections. But none of this discouragesme, because I have seen, I have heard, and I have felt. — Emanuel Swedenborg Secrets of Heaven §§67–68 * * * I talked to spirits about how my books may seem to be accepted when they are published. Evil spirits sometimes insinuated that nobody wouldunderstand them, that people would reject them. But while I was in thestreet talking to some spirits, the realization came to me that books arereceived in five different ways: Some people totally reject them becausethey have a different belief system, or they are opposed to any belief.These people reject the books; they can’t accept them because the ideas donot sink into their minds. Some people accept them as knowledge. Theyenjoy the books for the information and unusual things they contain.Some people accept them intellectually, receiving the ideas eagerlyenough, but they keep on living the same way they had before. Some peo-ple are influenced by them enough that the ideas sink in and change theirlives for the better. This happens when they are in particular states ofmind, and it is helpful to them. Some people accept them joyfully andgain confidence in them. —Emanuel Swedenborg Spiritual Experiences §2955"

      "text": "PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION, REVISED This reference work, first published in 1988 by the Swedenborg Scientific Association under the title Swedenborg Researcher’s Man-ual, has been widely distributed and used not only by persons intent on writing academic theses on one or more of the manyaspects of the thought of Emanuel Swedenborg but also by NewChurch ministers and others interested in serious study of theextensive, wide-ranging publications of the man who has beencalled the Aristotle of the North. I suspect that every author feels that his or her published work could and should be improved. Several dynamic factors led me todecide that the time had come for this work to be expanded andenriched. Since the first edition was published, there has been a ver-itable outbreak of new publications of Swedenborg’s writings andworks collateral to them. Also, in anticipation of the sesquicenten-nial of the Swedenborg Foundation, a highly skilled team was setup to begin production of a whole new edition of Swedenborg’slifetime output, to be called the New Century Edition. It seemedlogical and timely that a new edition of the Swedenborg Researcher’sManual be prepared as an appropriate companion to this new edi- tion. My colleagues on the board of the Foundation enthusiasticallyagreed, and it was also decided that the Foundation should publishit. Readers familiar with the first edition will quickly see that many of the shortcomings of that work have been corrected, and the pres-ent edition will, I sincerely believe, prove to be a much more user-friendly work than its predecessor. The first major change is that ofthe book’s title. This second, revised edition is now named Sweden- borg Explorer’s Guidebook: A Research Manual for Inquiring NewReaders, Seekers of Spiritual Ideas, and Writers of Swedenborgian xi"

      "text": "Treatises. This name reflects more accurately the clientele that has used the first edition. Part 1, “Swedenborg’s Writings,” is annotated and listed in chronological order, as in the first edition; it follows the order first presented by James Hyde in his great work Bibliography of the Worksof Emanuel Swedenborg. However, it is now prefaced by three lists of Swedenborg’s works, intended to lead readers more quickly to theinformation they seek. The first list is chronological; the secondalphabetical, arranged according to the most accurate English titles;and the third is a simple classification of Swedenborg’s works, inwhich his titles are grouped by types of writing: (1) Anatomy andPhysiology, (2) Concordances and Indexes, (3) Engineering, Math-ematics, and Science, (4) Literary, Letters, and Poetry, (5) Personal,including T ravels, (6) Philosophy and Psychology, (7) PoliticalEconomy, Commerce and Finance, Industry and Manufacturing,(8) Preparatory or Pre-theological Works, and (9) Theology, BibleExegesis, and Visionary Experiences. Some works have been listedunder more than one of these headings. Perhaps the most useful change will prove to be the greatly expanded index. A major part of the outbreak in publishing men-tioned above is the many new titles that have been added to Part 2,the section on collateral literature. To expedite finding a title, allcollateral literature is indexed both under author name and title ofthe work, whether it is a published book or a dissertation or thesis.Works by Swedenborg are indexed under each of their traditionaltitles, with cross-references to the most current title. If this revised guidebook serves to stimulate and aid readers as they pursue serious studies in any area of Swedenborgian thought, Ishall be amply rewarded for my efforts.

Manyreaders of the first edition worldwide, too numerous to mentionindividually, responded to my widely circulated letter requestingsuggestions for improving the volume. With the aid of these manyfriends, I have been able to make this second edition a much betterand more useful reference work. In particular, I must thank Dr. Jonathan S. Rose, the series edi- tor of the New Century Edition of the Works of Emanuel Swe-denborg, and Dr. Stuart Shotwell, the managing editor, for theirwork and guidance on this revised second edition. The annotatedbibliography that appears in Part 1 of this edition reflects theirscholarship, as first published in Emanuel Swedenborg: Essays forthe New Century Edition on His Life, Work, and Impact; because oftheir dedication and scholarship, many errors have been cor-rected. Also, I’d like to thank the many people who updated specific sec- tions of this edition: —Nancy Dawson and Stephen McNeilly of the Swedenborg Society, London —Neville Jarvis of the Swedenborg Centre, Sydney, Australia—Carroll Odhner and Eric Sandstrom of the library of Bryn Athyn College, Bryn Athyn, Pennsylvania —Barbara Macke of the Swedenborg Memorial Library, Urbana University, Urbana, Ohio —Michael Yockey of the Swedenborgian House of Studies, Berkeley, California xiii"

      "text": "INTRODUCTION In this book, I have attempted to collect all the basic data I reason- ably could in a single volume, together with information aboutwhere major collections of Swedenborgiana are located and briefdescriptions of the contents of those collections. Let me say a littleabout the several main sections of this book. Part 1, although not “exhaustive” in the sense of claiming to include every single jotting of the author, is the most complete andinformative bibliography to have been produced to date. In thisrevised edition, I have used the bibliography first published in thevolume Emanuel Swedenborg: Essays for the New Century Edition on His Life, Work, and Impact (and its paperback edition, titled Scribe of Heaven). The editorial committee of the New Century Editionfelt that, given the various short titles of Swedenborg’s works thathave been used in the past 250 years (some of which were mistrans-lations of the Latin), a standardized list of titles would eliminateconfusion when speaking about books written by Swedenborg. Afew entries have been redated based on evidence uncovered afterearlier bibliographies were published. In this section, I list only firsteditions, their current repository, and currently available Englishtranslations. Part 2 comprises a careful selection of collateral literature. Each section is subdivided into a number of categories. I began withwhat I consider “basic” reference works, such as concordances andcompendiums, indexes, and documentary collections—the basicprimary material for any researcher. Then, I proceed, in no particu-lar order, with analytic or devotional works, studies that may be ofinterest to both a scholar and to a general reader. The separating ofthese works into sections is entirely in the judgment of this editor,who is quite aware that others might classify some of these sameworks in other ways. I am also in no doubt that, although any xv"

      "text": "Swedenborgian scholar who knows the literature would probably list the majority of the works found here under “Basic ReferenceWorks,” others might have omitted several of my selections andadded a number that I chose not to cite. As is explained in the introduction to Part 2, the intent is to give the reader as comprehensive an idea as possible of the range andextent of literature collateral to Swedenborg’s thought that has beenproduced in the past two centuries. It is also this editor’s hope thatthis annotated listing may stimulate present-day scholars to furtherthe work so well and lovingly done by scholars of the past. Part 3 is a selective glossary of technical and special terms found in English translations of Swedenborg’s works. This text has bene-fited from the scrutiny of my colleagues at the former SwedenborgSchool of Religion and on the board of the Swedenborg Founda-tion, and, as a result, I have been able to improve many of my briefdefinitions. The introduction to this part also calls attention tosome of the differing norms for translation held by different pub-lishers of Swedenborg’s works, norms that the serious reader shouldbe aware of. As is noted, the glossary makes no pretense to beingexhaustive, but the effort has been to include words and phrasesthat are truly significant in the total philosophy of Swedenborg. Part 4 proved to be one of the most taxing sections to write. It begins with a statement of the breadth of opinions and beliefsabout the works produced by Swedenborg in his theological period.I have tried to state frankly where I stand in this matter, and theentries here reflect my personal opinion. It is not necessary forreaders to accept my hypothesis in order to profit from the dataincluded. The selection of concepts in the four divisions of this part is solely that of the editor. Not all scholars, past or present, agree onthe significance of the entries, especially those of the period of sci-ence and philosophy and those that bridge the two periods of Swe-denborg’s life. No claim is intended in any of the entries in thesetwo sections that Swedenborg was necessarily the first to discover orto propound these ideas. In the third section, since this editoraccepts Swedenborg’s claim to be a revelator, it may be presumedthat the intent is to set forth the theological concepts as originaland unique formulations, even though in some cases the name ofxvi INTRODUCTION"

      "text": "the concept or the term used to identify it may be well known and traditional. Part 5 should be of signal service to scholars intent on writing a serious academic study on some aspect of Swedenborgianism. Asnoted in the preface to this book, it has been my observation that,for instance, most academic theses on some aspect of Swedenbor-gianism, although often well written, generally are sparsely or,sometimes, imprecisely or even haphazardly documented. Yet it isonly fair to say that neither the scholars themselves nor their uni-versities can be held unequivocally responsible for this. Swedenbor-gians, in fact, have not done a good job of sharing their specializedknowledge with the rest of the world. One of the aims of this man-ual is to redress that lapse, at least in part. On a sabbatical leave, Ispent two months examining holdings in a number of libraries inEngland and Sweden. The descriptions of these, together withthose of the several collections in the United States, were writtenwith the serious researcher in mind. Part 6 is a chronology of Swedenborg’s life, intended as a handy reference to a researcher looking for biographical information andpublishing history. It is my sincere hope that this revised edition will prove beneficial to scholars of Swedenborg’s theology and will also be helpful to ageneral audience of interested readers who are looking for informa-tion on one of the most intriguing writers of the eighteenth or anyother century.INTRODUCTION xvii"

      "text": "SWEDENBORG’S WRITINGS Emanuel Swedenborg began to write and publish at the age of twelve. He continued to do so for seventy years. Much of what hewrote he left unpublished. His followers, however, in the course ofthe years, have made a well-nigh heroic attempt to edit, translate,and publish every known manuscript that came from Swedenborg’spen, often without any apparent regard to their relative signifi-cance. This effort has in no sense been coordinated, and there is agreat deal of overlap and duplication of posthumously publishedworks. Nor has there been any consistency in the choice of Englishtitles for his works. Thus, anyone who attempts to compile a com-plete bibliography of Swedenborg’s works is faced with a formida-ble task. Several such attempts have been made in the past; and although most of them have long been out of print, some of these compil-ations may usefully be called to the scholar’s attention. In the three-volume Documents Concerning Swedenborg, by R. L. Tafel, published by the Swedenborg Society, London 1875–1877, the edi-tor compiled a 140-page document (no. 313), “Swedenborg’s Pub-lished and Unpublished Writings in Chronological Order.” This iscarefully annotated, giving many details about most of the works.Tafel settled on 150 separate titles for Swedenborg’s lifetime out-put. In some instances, he stated his own conclusions as the reasonsSwedenborg may have had for not publishing some of his works(such as Revelation Explained ). He often worded such statements as if they were established in fact rather than his hypotheses. In the American edition of Samuel Warren’s Compendium of the Theological Writings of Emanuel Swedenborg, published by the New- Church Press, New York, in three printings dated 1879, 1880, and 3"

      "text": "1888, there is a condensed eight-page version of Tafel’s bibliogra- phy, using Tafel’s 150 titles, but in their English forms only, andwith brief annotations. The most thorough and informative bibliography ever done is that of James Hyde, published in 1906 by the Swedenborg Society,London, a volume of more than 750 pages, which was eight yearsin preparation. Hyde included two hundred titles. In his preface, henotes: “The main object has been to gather into one volume . . . thebibliographical data of all Swedenborg’s works, or attempted works,printed or unprinted, as well in their original as in their translatedforms, and in all the editions of each.” A supplementary volume oftwo hundred pages, in mimeograph format, was compiled by A. S.Wainscot and issued by the Swedenborg Society in 1967. BothHyde and Wainscot are out of print. In 1910, Almqvist & Wiksell (Uppsala and Stockholm) pub- lished a fifty-page work by Alfred H. Stroh and Greta Ekelöf, AnAbridged Chronological List of the Works of Emanuel Swedenborg,including manuscripts, original editions and translations prior to1772. These editors divided the works into 175 titles. Commentingon this increase in titles from Tafel’s 150, the editors note that theincrease “is more apparent than real, being largely due to themethod of subdivision employed, and to the introduction of itemssuch as memorials, which . . . were not included by Dr. Tafel.”Titles and descriptions are given only in the language of composi-tion or of publication. Some explanatory notes are in English. Then, in 2005, the Swedenborg Foundation published Emanuel Swedenborg: Essays for the New Century Edition on His Life, Work,and Impact .This volume contained the latest information on the dating of Swedenborg’s publications; the order of their writing,including unpublished material; and the holdings of original man-uscripts and first editions. The compiler of the publication listingin that volume, Jonathan S. Rose, also corrected misattributionsand indicated when a work was lost or was intended but may nothave been written. In the bibliography that follows, I shall draw freely on data found in the above works, while at the same time trying always to makeclear in the annotations what is fact and what is opinion.

      "text": "CHRONOLOGICAL LISTING OF PUBLISHED WORKS (CATEGORY P) AND UNPUBLISHED DOCUMENTS (CATEGORY U) The following synopsis presents a chronological overview of Swe- denborg’s writing and publishing.1In it, unpublished works (which are preceded by the letter “U”) appear at the time of their com-mencement, whereas published works (preceded by a “P”) appear atthe time of their final publication. This distinction in treatment,combined with the lack of exact dating for some of the works, ren-ders this chronology approximate rather than exact. This chrono-logical list does serve in general, however, to show that Swedenborgtended to alternate between periods of writing much but publish-ing little and periods of publishing much but writing little. Sinceshort titles alone might mislead readers into thinking of each titleas being of approximately the same size, information on the lengthof his published works is added here to highlight their variety. 1700 (2 published pieces, totaling 5 pages) P1 Verses for a Wedding (4 pages) P2 Verses to Notman (1 page) 1707 (1 published piece, totaling 1 page) P3 Verses to Bredberg (1 page) 61. This chronological list was first published in Jonathan S. Rose, et al., Emanuel Swedenborg: Essays for the New Century Edition on His Life, Work, and Impact (West Chester, Pa.: Sweden- borg Foundation, 2005). I wish to acknowledge the NCE series editor Jonathan S. Rose forhis work in compiling this listing."

It contains all the workslisted in Hyde’s Bibliography, supplemented by the additional titles listed by Wainscot in Additions to Hyde’s Bibliography; Stroh and Ekelöf in An Abridged Chronological List of the Works of EmanuelSwedenborg; and Whitehead in Posthumous Theological Works. Part 1 is divided into three sections. The first and main section, pages 44–207, follows Rose’s presentation, which breaks Sweden-borg’s output into extant published works (the letter “P” followedby a sequential number) and extant unpublished works (indicatedby the letter “U” followed by a sequential number), sorting the for-mer by publication date and the latter by initial date of writing. InRose’s list, published and unpublished works are given separately;in this list, published and unpublished works are combined andgiven in sequential order. The second section of Part 1 lists those works that Swedenborg intended to write but never did or that were formerly misattributedto him. This section, “Works of Uncertain Authorship and Pro-jected Works That Were Never Written,” contains entries sequen-tially numbered and preceded by the letter “X.” 42"

The following headings are used in describing the works, as per- tinent in each case: Language and form indicates the original language of the manu- script and whether it was written in prose or poetry. Status gives information for works left in manuscript form by Swedenborg; it lists whether the original document is extant ornot, and if not, whether copies survive or not.

Length indicates the number of pages of a brief article or unpublished manuscript. Written (between, around, or on or before) provides the known or approximate date of composition, whether known exactly orestimated. Publication facts gives the date and place of the first edition and the number of pages. Repository indicates where the original manuscript or author’s copy is located.

Among the verses contained in Heliconian Pastime is a work tra- ditionally titled “Verses on Father’s Portrait” (Full title: “In parentismei effigem aeneam quae non liquefacta est in domus ejus incendio[On the bronze bust of my father, which did not melt during a firethat broke out in his house]”), believed to have been written in1712. According to Stroh and Ekelöf, Swedenborg composed threesets of verses on his father’s portrait. The verses are quoted in hisfather’s manuscript autobiography, Jesper Swedbergs lefwernesbeskrifning [Account of the Life of Jesper Swedberg], of which there are copies in the libraries at Skara, Linköping, and Wisby. Sweden-borg’s lines were later engraved on the copperplate of Swedberg’sportrait (see Studia Swedenborgiana 1, no. 2 [June 1974] for further details).

There are at least four varying title pages on the six issues of this periodical, which was issued from 1716 through 1718. Issues 1–4and 6 are in Swedish; issue 5—by the wish of Charles XII—wasprinted in both Swedish and Latin, on facing pages. Publication ofissue 6 was delayed for more than a year for “lack of means” (seeLetters and Memorials 192). Some mechanical inventions (see U4–17, mentioned in Sweden- borg’s letter to Eric Benzelius of September 8, 1714) were intro-duced in this journal, such as a device for lifting weights, airpumps, and a flying carriage (adverted to along with the “mechani-cal carriage”). An essay in issue 6 (a proof that our vital essence consists of small vibrations) was translated by C. Th. Odhner and published as pages1–7 of Tremulation. See P46, below. Of the periodical itself, Cyriel Sigstedt writes, “It was hoped that the journal would also serve as the basis for a future learned society, whichin fact it did, for the present Society of Sciences of Upsala regards thispublication as the first of its Proceedings” (Swedenborg Epic 33). The entries below that represent Swedenborg’s writings in Daedalus Hyperboreus are P15 through P25, P27 through P29, P31through P41, and P45 through P47.

Very and Sir W. F . Bar-rett that were construed to be negative. Then, a year later, in the July 1913 issue of The New Philosophy, Alfred Acton devoted half the issue to a scathingly negative reviewof this edition, challenging the claim that it was a new translation,calling attention in detail to many “ignorant and ludicrous blun-ders,” and concluding: “. . . we must give wholesale and well-nighunqualified condemnation to the publication.” Then, to come full circle, in the October 1919 edition of The New Philosophy, there is an article by Ernst Pfeiffer, “A few notes onClissold’s translation of The Principia,” in which he notes thatwhile “it is true that the ‘revised’ edition published in London in1912 is much worse than that by Clissold, London 1846 . . . itmust also be said that very many of the erroneous renderings havebeen copied from Clissold.” He then goes on to detail, in severalpages, portions of Clissold’s work with which he disagrees.

Although the title Economy of the Animal Kingdom has been the sole title preferred for this work in the past, it is highly misleading. The Latin animalis does not here mean “animal” but “of the soul.” This work has nothing to do with what we term in English “the animal king- dom,” that is, animals as opposed to plants or minerals. It is a work on human anatomy asreflecting the soul. 8. The term “rational psychology” refers to a rational method of studying the soul or mind,that is, a method that relies on reason as the chief source and test of knowledge, as opposedto an empirical method, which would use experience as its chief source and test, or an eso-teric method, which would rely on special experience or intuition."

Hyde dates this piece to 1741, because it occurs in three segments among the notesthat comprise U92, which were written in 1741. Acton, however, takes the contents of thispiece as indicating that it came after U106, which he reassigns to “the early or middle partof 1744.” With some apparent hesitation—“it would indeed seem not improbable,” hesays of the dating—he places this piece in 1744 as well; see Psychological Transactions, xxvii–xxviii."

Alfred Acton, however, renum- bered the text to make the paragraph numbers consecutivethroughout the entire work. Starting in volume 3, he has includedat the bottom of the pages a cross-reference index to the numberingscheme in Tafel’s Latin version. The last volume is an index volumefor the whole set and has indexes of subjects, authors, and Scripturepassages. Several appendices are also included. In 1927, Acton published a volume titled An Introduction to the Word Explained (Bryn Athyn, Pa.: Academy of the New Church). The title is misleading, as only pages 6–16 are devoted to back-ground information on this large, tentative preparatory work. Thereader is referred to that section for further information. The bulkof this volume, as the subtitle indicates (The Means by Which Swe-denborg the Scientist and Philosopher Became the Theologian andRevelator) is Acton’s assessment of Swedenborg’s pre-theological lifeexperience.

At the beginningand end of many of the chapters are essays on theological mattersand accounts of Swedenborg’s experiences in the spiritual world.For other volumes of this work, see P86–P96, P100. For indexes tothis work, see U129, U134. For Swedenborg’s rough copies ofother volumes, see U128. The first volume of this largest work of Swedenborg, the first to be properly identified as a revelatory work, appeared in London inthe summer of 1749 with no indication of authorship. Unlike for-mer times when Swedenborg chose to publish anonymously, thistime he did so for nearly twenty years, although his identity wasknown to many by 1761. There have been a number of theories as to why he chose, from time to time, to hide his identity as author, one of the most attrac-tive being the following from Swedenborg Epic 156:SECRETS OF HEAVEN , GENESIS , VOLUME 1 (1749) 143"

      "text": "In launching The Economy of the Animal Kingdom [Dynamics of the Soul’s Domain] Swedenborg again donned the cloak of anonymity which he had employed twicebefore when presenting the public with a work on a com-pletely new subject. This veiled approach may have beendue to modesty, embarrassment at having overstepped thebounds of his profession. Or it may have come from hisdesire to avoid being disturbed by possible criticism. Hewas a genius that could not be confined by, or held downto, conventional limits. In 1721 when he published hisanonymous Principles of Chemistry [Chemistry and Physics] he was a mechanical expert. In 1722 when he anony-mously emerged into political life with a good solution tohis country’s economic ills he was known as a writer onphilosophy. In 1740, when he published The Economy of the Animal Kingdom, he was a famous mineralogist, and when in 1749 he issued anonymously his first theologicalwork, Swedenborg was known as a writer on anatomy! Sothe beginning of each literary cycle was unidentified withany preceding one, as if to give the ideas he propounded afair chance of acceptance on their own merits, unbiasedand unimpressed by preconceived opinions, and freedfrom the weight of his personality.

The complete work has also been published as Heavenly Arcana (Rotch edition). This set has long been out of print. Many books have been extracted from the full eight volumes, including thefollowing: The Internal Sense of the Word, a Translation of Extracts from Chap- ters Fifteen to Twenty-Three of Arcana Caelestia, translated by G. T. Hill (London: Swedenborg Society, 1974). The translator’s prefacestates that these extracts deal with the inner meaning of the Word(1) as it teaches laws of life and (2) as it serves as a conjoiningmedium between heaven and earth. Some of the extracts have beenrearranged from the order in which they appear in the larger work. Emanuel Swedenborg: The Universal Human and Soul-Body Interac- tion, edited and translated by G. F . Dole, introduction by S. Larsen, preface by R. Kirven (New York: Paulist Press, 1984). The text ofthe larger section of this book consists of extracts from Secrets ofHeaven, a related series of interchapter articles that begin at the close of the exegetical treatment of Genesis 23 and end after thetreatment of the text of Genesis 43. This material has traditionallybeen identified as Swedenborg’s doctrine of maximus homo (usually translated “Grand Man”). This is the first time this material hasbeen published separately in English. The smaller section of this book contains the full English text of Swedenborg’s 1769 publication, De commercio animae et corporis.See P120 below for further details concerning this work.

Bothassumptions have since proven incorrect. All other indications arethat this draft was begun late in 1758, since the manuscript refersback to the five works Swedenborg published in mid-to-late 1758.This rough copy and the fair copy (U136) were created almostsimultaneously—both end abruptly in the middle of explainingRevelation 19:10, just three sections apart. In 1766 Swedenborgpublished a briefer exposition of the Book of Revelation from asomewhat different perspective (see P114). The original is repro-duced in Phototypes 15–17. For an English translation, see Apoca- lypse vols. 1–5, and vol. 6, pages 1–408. Also see The Apocalypse Explained, 6 volumes, translation revised by I. Tansley (London: Swedenborg Society, 1919–1923). This set is kept in print in Eng-land. Commentators have put forth several theories as to the reason Swedenborg did not publish Revelation Explained. In his first, and favorable, biography of Swedenborg, William White suggested thatSwedenborg “laid the work aside—thinking probably that it wastoo voluminous and elaborate. . . .” In a similar but lighter vein,Brian Kingslake once suggested that possibly Swedenborg looked atthe size of the manuscript and simply decided he could not affordto publish it.

L. Tafel, in his typical way, assures us of the real reason, as fol-lows: “The great distinction between the ‘Apocalypse Explained’and the ‘Apocalypse Revealed’ consists in this, that while in the for-mer work the doctrine of the internal sense is applied to the churchuniversal, in the latter it is treated exclusively in its bearing on theNew Jerusalem Church and the relation it occupies in respect to theconsummated Christian Church. This is the reason why the author,when he saw the special signification of the Book of Revelation,suddenly ceased all his labors in connection with ‘ApocalypseExplained.’ . . . ” I am not aware of any place where Swedenborg tells us why, despite the fact that he prepared a clean copy for the printer of theincomplete Revelation Explained, he did not publish it, but instead waited several years before he started anew on this topic and pub-lished Revelation Unveiled. Unlike the later published work on the Apocalypse, this work not only deals in depth with the Book of Revelation but, especially inthe first twelve chapters, also contains detailed explanations of agreat number of parallel passages from various parts of both theOld and New Testaments. As he had done earlier in Secrets of Heaven, Swedenborg in the latter part of Revelation Explained began to intersperse between his units of Scripture exegesis a series of doctrinal essays on a variety ofsubjects. These have been abstracted, sometimes in whole, some-times in part, and published in separate small volumes. Listedbelow are some of these that are still in print: God, Providence, Creation, from the Latin of Emanuel Swedenborg, Extracted from His Posthumous Work “Apocalypsis Explicata,” andthere Titled “De Fide Athanasiana, De Domino,” etc., 2nd ed., trans-lation revised by I.

That a New Church is meant by the “NewJerusalem,” foretold in the twenty-first chapter of Revela-tion as to come after the Judgment, may be seen below, inthe last chapter.

Reference numbers: Tafel 127; Hyde 176:2195; Stroh and Ekelöf 155; Whitehead 211 Published anonymously. This book is a verse-by-verse exposition ofthe Book of Revelation. It is a completely new examination of thesubject treated in Swedenborg’s earlier unpublished work, Revela- tion Explained (U135–U136). For indexes to this work, see U156–U157. See also U153. Apocalypsis Revelata is a detailed unfolding of the inner sense of the Book of Revelation. There is an author’s preface, followed byhis summary of Catholic and Protestant doctrines. This is the firstof the late works in which Swedenborg appended so-called memo-rable relations or memorable occurrences to the explications of thechapters of Revelation. In 1765, Swedenborg had stopped writinghis spiritual experiences—a work which contains much materialsimilar to these descriptions of otherworld events—and now in this1766 work (and all subsequent publications), he included accountsof such happenings. In a letter written to his friend the ReverendDoctor Gabriel Beyer (1720–1779) in April 1766, he recom-mended that the doctor read these passages concerning his other-world experiences first. This is the last of the works that Swedenborg published anony- mously. There is some difference of opinion as to whether this is, asthe translator F . Coulson says, “a condensed and modified version”of the earlier incomplete work Revelation Explained, or a completely new and independent explication of the last book of the Bible. Theweight of evidence seems to be with the latter view. Unlike the182 REVELATION UNVEILED (1766)"

Now, nearly twenty years later, he commissioned the same man (J. Marchant) to translatethis work into English, and he published it shortly after the Latinedition. Swedenborg arranged to have copies of the English versionsent to a number of professors of divinity in Great Britain. One,the Reverend H. Hamilton, wrote in part regarding it, “Whateveresteem the Latin work may deserve, this I am sure will procure butlittle, it is so indifferently translated.” Noting his intention to write a complete treatise on the doctrines of the New Church, the author said he penned this work as a sortof interim sketch to give a general idea of this church and itsdoctrines.

The first is called ‘physical inflow,’ the second ‘spiritualinflow,’ and the third ‘preestablished harmony.’” Later he notes that“there can be no fourth opinion. . . .” His thesis is that spiritualinflow is “based on order and its laws,” and his argument supportsthat view. His “solution” to the mind-body problem, however, maywell constitute the most singularly unique methodology yet foundto cope with this time-honored philosophic problem: conducting alottery, in which the piece of paper on which had been written“spiritual inflow” was drawn! Hyde notes that this work “was not ‘published’ in the general acceptance of the word, but distributed privately.” On the last pageof this short treatise is the imprint “Londini, 1769.” Copies weresent to various scientific societies and universities in England andFrance. In a letter to Gabriel Beyer, dated October 30, 1769, Swe-denborg states that it may already be available in English, althoughit was not until early in 1770 that Hartley’s version was printed.

One of the most persistent fallacies in Swedenborgian scholarship is the notion that the Latin word coronis means a crown. Tafel, Hyde, and many other scholars of Swedenborg’s works make this mistake. In the context of publishing, coronis means a coda or epilogue—a piece of text at the end of a work or supplemental to it that rounds it off without beingessential to its integrity29.

Reflecting a worldwide pattern, most ofthese publications have been in English, although many Sweden-borgian books, pamphlets, and periodicals have been produced in adozen other languages. Today, the greatest number of such publica-tions are in German, Swedish, French, and Japanese. Some of themore significant of these will be listed and annotated below, but thegreater part of the following selection of collateral literature will belimited to those in English. Thousands of Swedenborgian collateral publications have been produced in the past two hundred years, so the approximately threehundred titles listed here represent a selection carefully limited bythe editor. Mainly, I have been concerned to list what I consider tobe basic reference works—works that any serious student of Swe-denborg should be familiar with—followed by a representativeselection of other significant studies. Sometimes, works will belisted not because they are favorably recommended to serious read-ers but to warn that they are (in the editor’s opinion) either preju-dicially hostile to Swedenborgianism or untrustworthy as referenceworks. The basic reference works are categorized as follows: concor- dances and compendiums; indexes; dictionaries; documentary col-lections; bibliographies; doctrinal summaries; exegetical works;biographies; historical studies; critical studies, including theses anddissertations; periodicals; digests, outlines, and synopses; studies in 217"

Based on the original Latin writings of the author. 6 vols. London: Swedenborg Society, 1888–1902. Reprints. One of the hazards of compiling a work of this size is exhibited on the title page of volume 1, which states that it is “in four vol-umes.” In fact, it was issued in fascicles over a fourteen-year periodand has always been bound in six volumes. The introduction statesthat the compiler had already devoted “between thirteen and four-teen years” to the task before publication began. This work is without rival as a primary reference work for all seri- ous readers of Swedenborg’s theological writings. The volumes aver-age over nine hundred pages each, and—in addition to the mainalphabetical concordance—the set includes a wealth of valuabledata, both in the front matter of volume 1 and the back matter ofvolume 6. Careful students will thoroughly familiarize themselveswith this material. Potts (who also translated and edited a number of Swedenborg’s works) used his own translations of all entries in this work. Oneshould note that in later years he radically changed his mind aboutthe choice of a number of English renderings of the original Latin.Thus, for example, in the Concordance, one finds an entry for the English term “scientific truth,” whereas in the translator’s preface ofhis version of Secrets of Heaven (Arcana Coelestia, Swedenborg Foundation, Redesigned Standard Edition), Potts has by this timecoined the term “memory-knowledge” to translate the same Latin.Further, in the Arcana preface, he is quite intolerant of those who exhibit the “lamentable ignorance” of rendering scientia and scien- tifica as “science” and “scientifics”! Because this concordance has been so universally used as a basic reference work by Swedenborgians worldwide, it is probablyfair to attribute to it much “in-house” or arcane terminology (whathas been called, with some justification, “Swedenborgese” or“Swedenborgianese”). The reader should be aware that, although the Swedenborg Soci- ety is to be commended for keeping this basic reference work inprint, presently available volumes are unchanged from the originalCONCORDANCES AND COMPENDIUMS 219"

Also, references in the front matter to “worksnot accessible in English” are no longer true.

It examines Swedenborg’s experiences with spirits he encountered in hell and his findings about the nature ofevil and offers new translations of his narratives, usually brieferthan those found in Conversations with Angels. These narratives are taken from a variety of Swedenborg’s works, including True Christ-ian Religion (True Christianity), Arcana Coelestia (Secrets of Heaven),Heaven and Hell, and Divine Providence.

There is abrief annotated bibliography of Swedenborg’s works in the back.This edition has been kept in print. Although not called a “second edition,” this standard paperback- size edition is, in fact, a radically corrected and edited version of theoriginal 1970 edition published jointly by T wayne Publishers andthe Swedenborg Foundation.

New York: Swedenborg Foundation, 1979. Reprints. This compilation has a long history, dating back to its predeces- sor, compiled and published by W. Fernald in 1853. The first edi- tion of Warren’s version was issued in 1875 in London. It has theadvantage of much more extensive citations on a very broad rangeof topics than those of most of the compendiums of Swedenborg’sworks (such as Dole’s A Thoughtful Soul, listed above), but has the disadvantage of being in nineteenth-century English. The edition currently kept in print is the London edition.

Index Generale des Passages de la Divine Parole, cités dans les Écrits d’Emmanuel Swe- denborg (General Index of Passages from the Divine Word Quoted inthe Works of Emanuel Swedenborg). Saint-Amand-Mont-Rond,France, 1859. This was the first index compiled listing every passage of Scrip- ture cited in all of Swedenborg’s theological works. The work is inFrench, although the title page, preface, and list of abbreviations ofSwedenborg’s works appear in French, English, and German,respectively. The abbreviations used in the text are based on theFrench titles of Swedenborg’s works. In the opinion of this editor, this index (which was the basis for the later version of A. H. Searle, listed below) had invaluable informationthat was unfortunately omitted by Searle. It consists of a system ofsuperscripted references, appended where appropriate, to indicatenot only if the formal text of a Bible passage is quoted in full orsimply referred to, but—most importantly—whether or not Swe-denborg gave, along with his Scripture citations, any information asto their deeper or spiritual sense. These latter references are identi-fied either by the letter “i” (illustration) or the letter “e” (explana-tion). The disadvantages of Le Boys des Guays’s version are (1) it predates Potts’s Swedenborg Concordance and thus does not contain Potts’s subdivisions of Swedenborg’s long paragraph sections (some ofwhich run to thirty or forty pages in Apocalypse Explained [Revela-tion Explained], for instance) and (2) it uses the verse divisions of the Hebrew Bible, which in some books, such as the Psalms, may differconsiderably from those in the English Bible. These factors have ledthis editor always to research references in Le Boys des Guays’sIndex first and then to cross-check the results in Searle’s Index. [R ICH, E.].

In some ways, this work remains the only work of its kind ever produced, despite the hope expressed in the introduction: “ThisGlossary can be regarded only as a beginning. Much better workwill doubtless be done by other compilers in time to come.” Bogg has many inspired choices that truly qualify as entries in a glossary, but at the same time there are some entries that do not inany sense define or that are outright irrelevant (see, for example, theentry on page 21, “confasciculations”).

The only complete Swedenborg bibliography in print(prior to the publication of the first edition of this SwedenborgExplorer’s Guidebook ) was in the back of Posthumous Theological Works of Emanuel Swedenborg, Volume 2, published by the Sweden- borg Foundation, New York, as the last volume in its thirty-volumeset of the Standard Edition of the Works of Emanuel Swedenborg.It was arranged chronologically and divided into three sections: “I.Period of Education 1688–1715,” containing titles numbered1–28; “II. Period of Science and Philosophy 1716–1745,” contain-ing titles numbered 29–154; and “III. Period of Theology1745–1772,” containing titles numbered 155–237. This summary,however, was not annotated and was compressed into sixteen pages.It was deleted in the Redesigned Standard Edition of this book,published in 1996. In the three-volume Documents Concerning Swedenborg, R. L. Tafel compiled a 140-page document (#313), “Swedenborg’s Pub-lished and Unpublished Writings in Chronological Order.” This iscarefully annotated, giving many details about most of the works.Tafel settled on 150 separate titles for Swedenborg’s lifetime out-put. In some instances, he stated his own conclusions as to suchthings as the reasons Swedenborg may have had for not publishingsome of his works (such as Apocalypse Explained [Revelation Explained] ). He often worded such statements as if they were established fact rather than his hypotheses. In the American edition of Samuel M. Warren’s Compendium of the Theological Writings of Emanuel Swedenborg, published by the New Church Press, New York, in three printings dated 1879, 1880,and 1888, there is a condensed eight-page version of Tafel’s bibliog-raphy, using Tafel’s 150 titles, but in their English forms only, andwith brief annotations entirely in English.BIBLIOGRAPHIES 235"

These editors divided the works into 175 titles. Commenting on thisincrease in titles from Tafel’s 150, the editors note that the increase“is more apparent than real, being largely due to the method ofsubdivision employed, and to the introduction of items such asmemorials, which . . . were not included by Tafel.” Titles anddescriptions are given only in the language of composition or ofpublication.

The fol-lowing entries represent a very small fraction of the works of thistype. This section is divided into several parts. The first part repre- sents works that, in the opinion of this editor, deserve to be clas-sified as basic reference works and should be the first ones studiedby a researcher in Swedenborgian thought. The other sectionsoffer a selection of responsible, well-written works that are suit-able for a variety of readers, ranging from scholars to general-interest readers.

The preface to this book states that “the Divine Authorship of the Word is the fundamental principle underlying the view of theBible that is herein presented, and the main purpose is to show: 1. The Rationality of a Spiritual Sense in the Word, 2. And that theessence of the Inspiration of the Word is the presence of a SpiritualSense within the Letter.” The scope of the work is remarkable for a book of three hundred pages. It begins with an analysis of humankind as the purpose ofcreation and the development of the unique language skills thatmade a written Word possible. It then traces briefly how we got ourBible, describing manuscripts, source narratives, redactions, etc.The bulk of the work is then given over to how one discovers theinner sense, looking in detail at each of the books of the Word asthey appear in the Bible, using “an episodic rather than a continu-ous method.” E BY, S.

At the time of the publication of this 160-page paperback book, the author was president of the British Conference of the New Church and principal of New Church College, London. It was pre-pared in anticipation of the 1970 World Assembly of Swedenbor-gians held in London. A promised sequel was never completed. In this editor’s review of the book in The Messenger (March 1971), it was noted in part that “this is a short, provocative, well-written and disturbing book, one which should be required readingfor every committed New Churchman.” The first part of the book is an extended definition of revela- tion. The second part deals with problems of person-to-personcommunication or dialogue in the light of God’s self-revelation.The favorite platitudes of some Swedenborgians are trampled onquite ruthlessly. Vickers takes a brave stand on how to respond tothe problem posed by the general content of Swedenborg’s Earths in the Universe (Other Planets) (page 66). But his most sobering assertion is this (page 80): “It is when we talk of the Lord andHis work that we falter most . . . and fall back on terms from thewritings because ’we know they cannot be wrong.’” Vickers ana-lyzes that contention as a logical fallacy and concludes that whatmay be called for on the part of Swedenborgians is “changes ofthought, teaching, presentation and vocabulary, and eventuallychanges of attitude to the very life of the church and its activi-ties.”240 P ART2: S ELECTED COLLATERAL LITERATURE"

It fails tostate, however, that despite the allusion to the “first eleven chaptersof Judges” in the title of the book, there is, in fact, nothing in thetext of this work on chapters 5, 8, 9, and 10. Nevertheless, as Swedenborg said very little about the book of Judges, this collection of sermons is a valuable source of informa-tion on the inner sense of part of the book. This editor is not awarethat any other volume has ever been published with a Swedenbor-gian interpretation of a significant portion of the book of Judges.

The nineteen discourses—actually long, detailed sermons, cover- ing the full text of the book of Daniel—constitute a memorial pub-lication.

He was also one of thetranslators of Swedenborg’s Spiritual Diary (Spiritual Experiences).He shared a vision with other Swedenborgians of his day that grad-ually, through the combined efforts of serious readers, a “Sweden-borgian Bible” would be produced. Its main feature would be astrictly literal translation from the original. The format of this work is similar to that used by Clowes, with the Scripture text in the left-hand column and a running spiritualsense commentary in the right.

Wethought that if the substance of the Apocalypse Revealed and the Apocalypse Explained were cast in a somewhat different mould, and presented in an accommodated form, a bookmight be produced that would serve as an introduction tothe perusal and study of these great works. The presentvolume is the result of an attempt to effect this object. Ithas been my aim to draw out the practical lessons of thevarious incidents of this mysterious book more directlythan it was consistent with Swedenborg’s purpose to do. Ihave also dwelt at greater length on the bright than on thedark side of the magnificent Vision of the ApocalypticSeer, as unfolded by the Seer of the New Jerusalem, with-out, however, designedly leaving either the meaningobscure or the lessons uncertain of those parts which havebeen more briefly treated. The explanation of the addressto the seven churches I owe to the late Rev.

Rare in works of this sort is a unit onwar and weapons in the Bible, followed by a chapter dealing withcolors, numbers, weights, measures, musical instruments, etc. Theconcluding chapters deal in detail with narratives from both theOld and New Testaments. Barrett’s additions are too numerous and varied to list. Although they somewhat overlap Madeley’s selection, they also range farbeyond his choices. Possibly the energy level of the remarkable Mr.Barrett finally ran low, as the very last item he added, pages726–730, has a sentence of absolute nonsense worthy of EdwardLear (although it surely could not have been intentional)! The sen-tence (which directly contradicts an accurate etymology by Made-ley on pages 39–40) reads as follows: “Correspondence is derivedfrom three Latin words, cor, re, spondeo, and literally means to answer again from the heart.” Ingenious?

This is a companion volume to the one published earlier byMitchell on the Parables of the New T estament Spiritually Unfolded(see below). The same general format is followed in each. The particular parable under consideration is first quoted in full. Then the general underlying lesson or theme is explained. Follow-ing this, the historical setting is outlined, if it is relevant and theauthor felt it would help in understanding the deeper meaning ormeanings.

V ANDUSEN, WILSON .The Presence of Other Worlds: The Psychologi- cal/Spiritual Findings of Emanuel Swedenborg. 1974. Reprinted, West Chester, Pa.: Swedenborg Foundation, 1991. This popular work by a clinical psychologist is not a biography in the usual sense of that word—all the facts or events of Sweden- borg’s life are gathered together in chapter 1. The main body of thework is a psychological study of Swedenborgian ideas and their sig-nificance in personal lives. There is strong emphasis on the “innerworld” and on the symbolic nature of existence itself. It is well written and absorbing reading. The author is clearly a dedicated admirer of Swedenborg and his works. W HITE, W.Emanuel Swedenborg: His Life and Writings. 2 vols. Lon- don: Simpkin, Marshall & Co., 1867. Condensed and reissued in one volume in 1868. White had published a small, competent, and sympathetic biog- raphy of Swedenborg in 1856, reprinted in America in 1866. Heserved for some years as manager of the publishing operation of theSwedenborg Society, London. After some disagreement with hisemployers, who subsequently fired him, White then wrote andpublished this impressive two-volume work, which, astonishingly,proved to be a hostile biography. Apparently, he vented his angeragainst the Swedenborg Society by “taking it out” on Swedenborgand his works.

This fifty-page booklet was issued with no indication as to authorship, although it apparently was soon widely known that C. T. Odhner was the principal writer. It begins by stating that “inview of the long continued controversy in the New Church inregard to the real nature of the Theological Writings of EmanuelSwedenborg, their authority, and their relation to the Word of God,it is of the greatest importance that these Writings should beallowed to testify in their own behalf.” While the greater part of the text is composed of direct quota- tions, the subheads are editorial in nature and—perhaps not sur-prisingly—were subjected to the most severe criticism by thoseholding different views. For example, the third and fourth of thesereads: “That the Writings of the New Church are the Lord’s ownworks,” and “That the Writings of the New Church are from theLord’s own mouth” ranked high as targets for the acrimonious dis-agreements that ensued. ———.

From the perspective of half a century, Odhner attempted to eliminate the flaws of a booklet produced in a time of controversy.He added considerably to the contents and endeavored to let thepassages from Swedenborg speak for themselves, inviting the readerto consider them in context.

Apparently quite independently of the controversy outlined above, this book appeared. Seward, a strong voice in Convention, states that this work is not an attempt to attack the Academy but is ratherintended to defend Swedenborg’s writings. He further states that itwas written “without consulting any of his contemporaries in Con-vention, because he did not wish to commit the Convention or anyof its members to his view, but to let it speak for itself.” His con-cerns are almost entirely related to differing ways of interpreting thesecond half of Swedenborg’s work Conjugial Love (Marriage Love). 5HISTORICAL STUDIES 287"

This minor work of Kant, published in German in 1766 before the author had gained fame as a philosopher, constituted, accordingto Ernst Benz, “a deathblow for Swedenborg in Germany.” This English version, translated while Goerwitz was a student at the New Church Theological School in Cambridge, Massachusetts,was edited and footnoted by Sewall to such an extent that the orig-inal work was well nigh transformed into a positive statement con-cerning Swedenborg and his works.

New York: Vantage Press, 1969. In his preface, the translator notes that this is an entirely new translation and that when he began the project he had no idea thatit had already been translated by Goerwitz. He pays tribute to thepioneering work of Goerwitz and Sewall, but also notes some of theweak points of the earlier work. Interestingly enough, as a non-Swedenborgian, his assessment of Kant’s motives in writing thisstrange work is not far removed from that of the two Swedenbor-gians who produced the earlier version.

Suedenborugu was written after Suzuki had translated several works by Sweden-borg into Japanese and found him a worthy example for the Japan-ese to emulate.

Unlike some commentators on Swedenborg, Coleridge was without doubt well read in his works. Edmisten’s thesis reproducesthe bulk of Coleridge’s marginal notations found in several volumesof Swedenborg’s works. Further, Coleridge lived for several years in that section of London where the New Church organization wasformed by adherents to Swedenborg’s theology. He knew someeminent Swedenborgians, notably Charles A. T ulk and JohnFlaxman. Edmisten has performed a useful service in collecting these com- ments of Coleridge. Although some of the comments are unfavor-able, for the most part they reflect a strong admiration for both theconcepts and the philosophical outlook of Swedenborg. What mayseem disappointing is the seeming reluctance of the author to drawany conclusions of his own beyond those expressly stated inColeridge’s commentary.

Thisinfluence extended over Emerson’s life between the year 1826 (orwhen he was 23 years old) and the close of his life. Emerson owedmuch to disciples of Swedenborg, especially to Sampson Reed,whose Growth of the Mind gave Emerson his first inspiration for publication.” Not in any way to gainsay Hotson’s conclusions, it should never- theless be said in all fairness that much of this very long dissertationis concerned with attitudes about and approaches to Swedenborgby many individuals, in the course of which the author’s stronglypartisan attitude toward Swedenborg’s religious writings becomesevident.

First, Kant sets forth a philosophical reconstruction ofSwedenborg’s visions of the spirit world. Second, he ridicules Swe-denborg in order to clear himself of the damaging suspicions thathe took the ideas of an enthusiast and heretic seriously. Kantattained both ends by writing Dreams on two levels. To demon- strate that it is written on two levels, the author offers three types ofevidence. First, historical evidence establishes that Kant had suffi-cient motive to disavow any positive regard for or debts to Sweden-borg. Second, Kant’s discussions of Swedenborg outside of Dreamsestablish that he took Swedenborg much more seriously than thisbook would have one believe.

Kirven is a retired professor of the Swedenborg School of Reli- gion, Newton, Massachusetts. The main theme of his dissertation is that, when Swedenborg abandoned his scientific studies around1745–1747 to devote himself full time to theological pursuits, hisunique experiences led him to gain empirical knowledge of heavenand of God. The idea of such perception in turn forms the basis ofSwedenborg’s revolt against deistic restrictions on religious knowl-edge, and his use of this perception in his theological writings stim-ulated a variety of reactions from philosophers, churchmen, andliterati who were actively involved in the widespread revolt againstdeism. What the author calls Swedenborg’s “empirical revelation” is examined in relationship to the philosophical, ecclesiastical, andpsychological issues of that day, as reflected in the writings ofErnesti, Kant, Oetinger, Wesley, Priestley, Herder, and others. Thesecond part deals separately with these issues in English, French,and German thought up through 1840. L INEHAM , P ETER JAMES .“The English Swedenborgians: 1770–1840.

The movement had veered to and fro as it caught fresh gusts of interest from the side-winds of English intellectual history.” He goes on to conclude that the Swedenborgians’ need to survive in Victorian England forced many changes: their theology becameless inward; they became less theosophical and ceased to read Swe-denborg’s writings as thoroughly as they originally did. Then astime went on, the relevance of Swedenborg’s ideas, the authorposits, became less clear. “Progress” left the adherents to this faithbehind. Thus, only “a few people in the twentieth century continueto read Swedenborg. The New Church survives still. But so too dothe old questions.” On that somber note, the dissertation ends.

Positive evi-dence of William Blake’s exposure to Swedenborg’s visionary writ-ings and some of his London followers exists . . . but disagreementcontinues over both the extent of his exposure and the degree towhich he was influenced by the ideas of this Enlightenment seer.”Morley then states that he intends to demonstrate a more extensiveinfluence than some allow by exploring alternative paths to Blake’searly Swedenborgianism.

This thesis, although not in any sense directly concerned with Swedenborg and his works, does give considerable attention toone of the odd offshoots of his thought, which was an influenceon French freemasonry. The author, based on statements in herdissertation abstract, was apparently not at all knowledgeableabout Swedenborg when she submitted her thesis, as can be seenfrom numerous errors and misstatements.

In her introduction the author writes: “Sampson Reed was a tal- ented and prolific American writer who published over a hundredessays in his lifetime. His major work, a small book entitled Obser- vations on the Growth of the Mind, went through a successful run often printings, from 1826 to 1886, in England and the UnitedStates. He was applauded by Ralph Waldo Emerson and ThomasCarlyle and was avidly read by most of the New England transcen-dentalists. Yet he stands today as one of the most obscure figures inAmerican literature.” Shaw discusses in depth several of Reed’s literary works and also cites a letter he wrote to Theophilus Parsons, a Harvard classmateand fellow Swedenborgian. In this letter he wrote, “I can see norhymes in nature. . . .” The author comments: “For a literary stu-dent this is the most striking observation in the letter,” and sheconcludes that, in order to understand how Reed arrived at such aremarkable departure from the norm, one has to focus on twophrases: that the Word of God is essential poetry, and that poetrycan have but one essence, love, but one form, nature. These, shenotes, are to be understood in a strictly Swedenborgian context.

They refused to accept theliteral interpretation of the Bible and opted for an allegorical inter-pretation that supported Swedenborg’s doctrines. The height of thisexegetical frenzy was reached when Swedenborg’s followers appliedtheir own allegorical method to the work and life of the masterhimself. This effort produced the extremely odd but still revealingphilosophies of Swedenborgians like Henry James, Sr., and the spir-itualist Thomas Lake Harris. . . . Swedenborgianism as a method, asa way to speak about the external world, has a far more popularapplication in four principal areas: in American spiritualism, inAmerican medical theory, in American art, and in the public edu-cation movement of the antebellum years. . . . “The originality of this work lies in the discussion of these four subjects in the last four chapters. . . .” It may be that the author has properly pointed to the most sig- nificant part of his thesis, even though, in the eyes of this editor(and probably the majority of Swedenborgians), the author hasbased his conclusions on fallacies.

While the problem of this influence will be explored, I shall primarilyargue that both men derived their inspiration, expressed individu-ally, from a common source that I have designated as the ‘Gnosticthreshold.’ While mystical insight itself cannot pass from master todisciple, the pathways for approaching and attaining that insightcan be imparted, as we well know, from the world’s many mysticaltraditions. . . . Everyone feels at times the subtle stirring of that‘place’ beyond normal space that is analogical space. Gnosis is thekey to heaven (and hell); we have but to find out how the mysticsand poets turned the key to enter there ourselves. In this study Iwill use the new but ever-widening theoretical school of GnosticCriticism in order to make and approach into analogical space”(from the author’s abstract). CRITICAL STUDIES 311"

In this eighty-eight-page thesis, Mr. Studebaker lays no claim to anything approaching competence in the works of either Emerson or Swedenborg. As he expressed it, he limited his research to “typi-cal portrayals” of the relationship that he feels exists between theEmersonian and the Swedenborgian ideas of ontology, creativity,and poetry. Through what he describes as a cursory inspection oftheir philosophy and aesthetics, the author concludes that bothmen had much in common; further, that “both still have much tooffer man as he continues to think about himself and his exis-tence.” Probably neither Emerson scholars nor Swedenborg schol-ars would argue with that premise.

This study, which combines commendable research with first- rate and eminently readable writing (something of a rarity in aca-demic theses), was reviewed at length in The New Philosophy, October 1972. Swank, drawing on some little-used archives in the libraries of the Academy of the New Church, Bryn Athyn, Pennsylvania, andthe Swedenborg School of Religion, Newton, Massachusetts,picked a critical thirty-year period in the life of organized Sweden-borgianism in America. In chronicling this brief epoch, the authoraccurately identified and delineated three concurrent trends in theongoing movement, trends that led eventually to the formation ofthe General Convention of the New Jerusalem Church and also tothe Academy Movement. At the same time, it left a group of indi-vidualists who found no home in either of these frameworks.Swank gives them the perspicuous title of “free spirits.” Of these,the elder Henry James is probably the most celebrated. In order to put his thesis in perspective, the author first outlines the British beginnings of Swedenborgianism, noting that, within itsfirst generation, it stretched across the Atlantic.

Thus thelocale of Swank’s thesis spans the Atlantic seaboard, New England,and the Midwest. The primary criticism by this editor is that the author tended to aggrandize or exaggerate the numerical realities of the movement.For instance, a single protagonist may coalesce into a “party,” and afamily may become a “congregation.” But this is a minor matterand does not detract from the overall usefulness of Swank’s study; itmay even enhance its appeal for some readers.

The author of this thesis, a lifelong Swedenborgian, was for a number of years a director of the Swedenborg Foundation. As istrue of at least two other studies included in this section, this one isnot directly concerned with Swedenborg or his thought. However,the author has carefully traced the influence of Swedenborg on thepoet. In his preface the author states, in part, “Chapter III, ‘The For- gotten Purpose of Jesus,’ is the longest and most important one inthe dissertation. It attempts to state Markham’s ethics and at thesame time trace the sources from which he derived his fundamentalview of life. Jesus Christ, Emanuel Swedenborg, Thomas Lake Har-ris, and Victor Hugo emerge here as the most potent forces inmolding the poet’s thought.” There are, in fact, extensive remarks on specific areas of Sweden- borg’s thought that influenced Markham, including the seer’s ideason use, life after death, proprium, ruling love, free will, marriage, and regeneration.

There was need for a more open-ended growth model that also had room for a God that cared, whoeffectively related to man, and who continued to call man intobeing. The paper which follows is an effort to delineate a theologi-cal base for such a growth model.” The key word in T urley’s title, “Theotherapy,” is explained in the first chapter as a therapeutic perspective that is explicitly God-conscious. The theological undergirding is clearly defined as Swe-denborgian, on the thesis that that perspective provides a synthesisof philosophy, theology and psychology, which in turn offers afruitful, consistent and coherent base for pastoral counseling. Thereis ample evidence of wide reading in contemporary schools of psy-chotherapy and counseling, including such well-known names asMay, Maslow, Rogers, Sullivan, and his mentor Clinebell; but alsoAssagioli, Glasser, and Hulme. T urley’s conclusion notes in part that, if the pastoral counselor be a Swedenborgian, he has the good news to share of love’s purpose of“a heaven from the human race”—a perspective that prizes individ-uality for its inherent worth and for its participation in the perfec-tion of the whole.

But there is a real need for the study of Swedenborg’s exe-gesis, particularly in relation to the development of his thought,which was not only scientific and philosophical but also biblical. “The basic assumption of this thesis is, therefore, that Sweden- borg as exegete cannot be understood unless we get behind the for-mal ‘repellent’ exegesis to the wellsprings of his thought, hisexperience, and his understanding of revelation” (from the author’spreface).

The theme of this thesis is that there is a body of ethical theory in the voluminous writings of Emanuel Swedenborg that, althoughtheological in form, nevertheless has features of interest to thephilosophical student of ethics. Swedenborg developed a complex psychology. Three basic levels of mind are described. Innate qualities are free will and rationality.A middle area of mind serves as a communication link between theplane of sensation and that of thought. T ruth is the means to human fulfillment, giving form to a per- son’s affections. However, love is the life of a person. A person iswhat he or she loves and believes.

A person will choose one of three basic ruling loves: love of heaven, love of theworld, or love of self. The latter two are good only if they are sub-ordinated to the first (i.e., are not made ruling loves).

This dissertation was published in installments in The New Phi- losophy, starting in the issue of January–March 1990 and conclud- ing in the issue of July–December 1991. The aim of this dissertation is to show that, in the writings of Swedenborg, there is a unique philosophy of causality of interest tophilosophical students of metaphysics. In his student days, Swedenborg became aware of the historical development of causal theories, aligning himself with the conserva-tive medieval Christian position, which saw God as First Cause andthe physical universe as his purposeful creation. As a scientist he developed his own complex theory of causation, which embraced concepts of forms, of order and degrees, of seriesand society, of correspondence and representation, of influx, and ofmodification. However, a projected summary work that was todraw together and unify these doctrines was never written. Instead,he passed through a transition, an experience that left him con-vinced that he had been divinely commissioned to be a revelator.CRITICAL STUDIES 317"

His theological works poured forth from his pen for the next quarter century. Although one might think, there-fore, that his works now would hold little interest for philosophers,this did not prove to be the case. His causal theory, developed as ascientist, dovetailed precisely with his theological causal concepts;thus, his philosophy of causality proved to be a reliable tool for reli-gious investigations. This fact, unfortunately, has escaped the noticeof most scholars intent on linking in positive terms the findings ofscience and religion. This dissertation examines the relevance of Swedenborg’s causal theory to cosmology, with some commentary on his pioneering rolein the history of nebular hypotheses; the steps that were followedby the great Swede toward a solution of the perennial mind/bodyproblem; and finally some unique ideas in regard to philosophicnotions of matter, substance, and form. The identification of sub-stance with love and of form with truth constitutes the basis for oneof the primary findings of the study. The one only substance, the ultimate reality, is love. That by and through which it takes form is truth. The result or end product ofthat process is use. These three are discrete degrees separated fromeach other, being related by correspondence as end, cause, and effect.Love uncreate is God. The form or truth manifestation that Godtakes is the human form. All of creation, therefore, is related to andin some sense reflects the divine human form. The goal of creation isan endlessly increasing heaven of human beings embodying, so far asfinitude can mirror infinitude, this divine human form.

Indexes to Periodicals As noted above under “Current Periodicals,” since the first Sweden-borgian organization came into existence, partisans of variousaspects of Swedenborg’s thought have founded and publishednumerous periodicals. Most of these have had some sort of “inter-nal” indexing scheme, i.e., appended to the issue published at theend of a year or at the end of a “volume” unit will be an index forthe particular time period. These vary considerably in length fromperiodical to periodical. Although this is better than no index at all,the person researching a given topic in a periodical thus indexed isfaced with the tedious task of checking every annual or volumeindex. Much to be preferred is, of course, a cumulative index pub-lished separately. Unfortunately, few of the Swedenborgian periodi-cals are indexed in this way. The following list makes no pretense at being exhaustive, listing simply those indexes known to this editor. Faraday Index.

This handsomely produced set of small (4 1⁄4″×6″) hardbound vol- umes was intended by the author to present Swedenborg’s primaryteachings in an edited and definitive format. With the exception ofthe last volume, which is called a “compend,” the claim is that “thereader will find a full and complete statement, not what is com-monly understood by a compendium, of the author’s teachings onthe several subjects therein treated—generally more full and com-plete than is to be found in any one of Swedenborg’s own volumes,because of the relevant and supplemental passages added from sev-eral of his works.” The entire set was later reprinted by the Swedenborg Publishing Association, an independent publishing body founded by Barrett. The titles of the several volumes are as follows: 1. Death, Resur- rection, and the Judgement; 2. Heaven; 3. Freedom, Rationality,and Catholicity; 4. Divine Providence; 5.

Baker examines this relation-ship from both his own experience as a physicist and also his reli-gious faith—based upon the theological writings of EmanuelSwedenborg. B ERRIDGE , NORMAN .The Natural Basis of Spiritual Reality. Bryn Athyn, Pa.: Swedenborg Scientific Association, 1992. The ideas in this book began to develop in Berridge’s inquiring mind while he was studying biochemistry at Birmingham Univer- sity and first began to read Swedenborg’s theological writings. Thisled him on a philosophic-scientific odyssey that continued throughthe years of his professional development in a distinguished scien-tific career. His many published papers concerning biochemical andphysiological researches earned him recognition as a world author-ity in his field. Berridge shows that real, causal, and functional correspondences exist between natural and spiritual things: between the world ofnature and the world of the mind. In the first chapter, he says, “Ifall the world of nature is a representation of the spiritual world, ourscientific knowledge should enable us to . . . understand moreclearly what has been revealed concerning spiritual things.”332 P ART2: S ELECTED COLLATERAL LITERATURE"

At the same time, in compil-ing this list, this editor has tried always to get back to the originalmeanings the author had in mind, so far as that is possible. Swedenborg was acutely aware of biblical theological language and tended to use traditional terms found in the Bible. However,more often than not he redefined the familiar words to fit into thenew theology he was propounding. Thus, you will find in this glos-sary a number of well-known words, but often they will be rede-fined so as to take on entirely new meanings. English translations in this century have been mainly done either under the auspices of the Swedenborg Society (London) or theSwedenborg Foundation (West Chester, Pennsylvania). T ranslatorsworking for the former of these two organizations were, for aboutforty years, required to follow a set of rules prepared by the Lon-don-based society. For many years, these rules were called “Regula-tions and Code for T ranslators.” In 1975, a thoroughly revisedversion was issued and retitled “A T ranslator’s Guide.” It has threesections: (1) regulations governing the work of the board and theformat to be used in their publications; (2) Latin words used by Swedenborg for which translation rulings or suggestions aregiven; (3) miscellaneous memoranda that record various board 345"

The result has been a commendable uniformity in printing style and format; but at thesame time, use of the “guide” has created a degree of rigidity intranslating that, in the opinion of this editor, no competent transla-tor should be subjected to. Scholarly writers generally tend toward being either a “terminolo- gist” (one who consciously uses most of the terms of his language ina consistent technical way), or a “contextualist” (one who is littleconcerned with technical definitions of terms but relies on the con-text in which he uses a word or phrase to make his intended mean-ing clear). In a lengthy article in Studia Swedenborgiana 5, no. 3, this editor made a strong case for classifying Swedenborg as a con-textualist, as defined above. If this identification of Swedenborg’s writing style is at all accu- rate, then it is somewhere between unreasonable and foolhardy torequire his translators to superimpose a terminological consistencyon his works in English that simply was not there in the originalLatin. Yet the translator working for the Swedenborg Society, forexample, was faced up until quite recently with the following (andquite a number of other) regulations: Homo, vir. The distinction between homo and vir, unless clear from the context, shall be indicated by inserting theLatin word in brackets after “man.” 1 Scientifica, cognitiones. The word cognitiones (plural) is to be translated “cognitions” with a footnote calling attentionto it at its first occurrence in any volume. 2 Scientifica is to be translated “known facts” with the option of suppressing “known” in appropriate contexts. Scientia is to be translated “knowledge” when used in context withthese words.

Appearance Used to distinguish pure or divine truth from its accommodatedforms. Thus, everyone sees truth according to his or her finite state.These appearances of truth are not illusions because, if they areused with good intent, the Lord accepts them as true. As of Self As if by one’s own power, seemingly on one’s own. A critical con-cept in Swedenborg’s theology: one is to act “as if” self-powered,but at the same time to acknowledge that all power to act comesfrom God. Balance Used to refer to every person’s providential state in which the forcesof hell and heaven impinge equally, leaving one free to make moraldecisions, despite the appearance at times that one is overwhelmedby evil influences.

Contrast this with esse, the “soul” or essential nature of a thing. Being (esse) The essential quality of a thing, reality itself, God’s fundamental essence, that is, divine love.

A spiritual person is thus a “church.” Church of the New Jerusalem The most generally used name of those churches that draw theiressential interpretation of Christian doctrine from the theologicalwritings of Emanuel Swedenborg. Often simply “New Church.” Cognitions Sometimes translated “knowledges.” It is used to mean facts organ-ized into ideas, or deeper levels of knowing. Elliott retains it as anEnglish word in his version of Arcana Caelestia defining it as “items of knowledge relating to interior things.” Collateral Good A degree of goodness between natural and spiritual goodness,resembling each in part, but being essentially a natural love of spir-itual things, thus not genuine goodness, but related to it.

Discrete Degrees Distinct levels, one higher than the other, as in the relationships ofend, cause, effect. Also called vertical levels, degrees of altitude, anddegrees of height.

Doctrine Used to mean (1) the process of learning, (2) a branch of learningor science, or (3) the teaching of the church on a particular point.Generally, this will be a teaching vital to living a truly religious life,and thus will be essentially practical. Thus, a “doctrine” could bedefined as a set of truths for spiritual living placed in proper ororderly relationship to each other. Domestic Good Used to mean the good tendencies that a person derives hereditarilyfrom parents. It is not “saving” unless the person confirms the ten-dency in freedom. It is also called “domestic natural good” and“natural good.” Efflux Output, a flowing out. The good and truth that flow into personsfrom God should in turn flow out into the world in the form ofacts of love to the neighbor. God’s universal law is that influx isalways according to efflux. Emissary or Emissary Spirit An infrequent term in Swedenborg’s writings. Its use is sometimesconfusing as he says in some places that these emissaries are called“subjects” or “subordinates.” Chadwick in his glossary has thisentry at subjectum: “1.

These emis-sary spirits are called ‘subjects,’ for through them as subjects thesocieties speak.” End, Cause, Effect Used in the philosophical sense of goal or purpose, end is the loveor intention of the will; cause is the means through understandingto achieve the purpose; and effect is the resulting action, speech,sensation, or production thus achieved.

      "text": "SELECTED LIST OF KEY SWEDENBORGIAN CONCEPTS As observed in Part 1 of this book, Swedenborg’s lifetime literary output is generally divided by his followers into pre-theologicalwritings and theological writings. The first division—generallycalled his period of science and philosophy—comprises works writ-ten between 1716 and 1745. The second division—generally calledhis period of theology—comprises works written from 1745 to theend of his life in 1772 (although the work regarded by most Swe-denborgians as his first revelatory work, Secrets of Heaven [ArcanaCoelestia], was published between 1749 and 1756, in eight volumes). There is no universal agreement as to which of the concepts developed in his first period were carried over and adapted as partof the theological system in his second period. Some followerswould claim that there is no real connection between a pre-theo-logical idea and any apparently similar theological idea, arguingthat everything written by Swedenborg, and identifiable as “doc-trine of the New Church,” “was received from the mouth of theLord alone,” and thus is not properly classifiable as a further devel-opment of any of the seer’s own thoughts. One defense thatappears to be of this sort, for instance, cites a sentence from a lateposthumous and fragmentary work of Swedenborg’s (see Sketch for a History of the New Church, 1770), which reads, “3. The books are to be enumerated which were written, from the beginning tothe present, by the Lord through me [a Domino per me].” (Itshould be noted, incidentally, that no such enumeration was everdone by the author.) Probably the majority of Swedenborgians worldwide would not impose such severe restriction on the relationship between thethought content of the two major periods in Swedenborg’s life. 367"

The following entries are divided into four sections: (1) key con- cepts in the pre-theological works which are relevant to the historyof science and philosophy; (2) key concepts that bridge the twoperiods of the author’s life, mainly being those concerned with “lifeessence” and with “relationship”; (3) key concepts unique to thetheological writings; and (4) key concepts about humankind andour intended destiny. In compiling these, the editor has unabashedly drawn on a wide range of resources, both published and unpublished, with no effortwhatever to identify any or all antecedents (which would be diffi-cult or impossible to do in many instances anyway). The principalconcern is to offer to the reader the best summaries possible in themost concise compass. 1. Pre-theological Concepts Relevant to the History of Science and Philosophy The entries that follow are in roughly chronological order and are acareful selection of (1) what some biographers have sometimesoverzealously called “inventions” but which were more often thannot ingenious applications of well-known mechanical principles;(2) pioneering studies and practical applications in mathematics,astronomy, mechanics, geology, mining engineering, and chem-istry; (3) basic researches in human anatomy and brain physiology;and (4) rudimentary findings in various aspects of philosophy.

A useful illustratedreference work for thoughts on Swedenborg as an inventor is AlfredActon, ed, and trans., Mechanical Inventions of Emanuel Swedenborg(Philadelphia: Swedenborg Scientific Association, 1939), particu-larly pps. 16–17. Flying Machine (1716) A “sketch of a machine to fly in the air” was published by Swedenborgin Daedalus Hyperboreus, no. 4. A drawing of this was found among Benzelius’s papers, and a model made on the basis of this drawing byGustav Genzlinger is in the Smithsonian Institution, Washington,D.C. A small book about this machine was prepared by Henry Soder-berg, a retired vice president of Scandinavian Airlines: Swedenborg’s1714 Airplane (New York: Swedenborg Foundation, 1986). First Algebra in Swedish (1718)In 1712 Swedenborg had written, “I am now busy working my waythrough algebra and higher geometry.” The published work wasreviewed favorably in contemporary journals. Finding Longitude by the Moon (1718) This was a preoccupation of the author for a number of years, as itwas at this time for many naval engineers and sailors. It is not clearto this editor how valid his proposed method was. Docks, Canal Locks, and Saltworks (1719) As Christopher Polhem’s assistant, Swedenborg took an active partin the construction of naval docks at Karlskrona and the earlystages of the canal connecting the Baltic and North Seas. He pub-lished several short papers on these works. Height of Water and Strong Tides (1719) This is evidence of our author’s pioneering studies in the burgeon-ing science of geology.

One of the insightsin this work, which predates conclusions of later physiologists, readsin part as follows: “It frequently happens that a person falls into thethought of another person, that he perceives what another is doing andthinking, that is, that his membrane trembles from the tremulation ofthe other person’s cerebral membranes, just as one string is affected byanother, if they are tuned in the same key.” Chemistry (1721) At this time, chemistry was just emerging out of alchemy, and suchbasics as the composition of air and water and the nature of heatand fire were as yet unknown. All metals were regarded as com-pounds of salt, sulfur, and mercury. This, in part, was the back-ground of Swedenborg’s 1721 publication. Some of his initialassumptions—for instance, that in the geometrical relations of par-ticles, we have the complete explanation of properties of naturalsubstances and physical phenomena—cannot, of course, be main-tained, and the work in general is obsolete. But it has both interestand historical significance, if only for the evidence it gives of earlygrappling with problems of molecular physics and the genesis ofvarieties of matter.

In a commentary on Swedenborg’s formulation of a nebular hypothesis in his Basic Principles of Nature (Principia) (1734), Samuel Beswick wrote in part, “ . . . when Kant was only ten yearsold, Swedenborg had formally given the same ideas and views of creation—expressly calling his essay ‘The Theory of the SiderealHeavens.’” Svante Arrhenius wrote in his Cosmologica, 1908: If we briefly summarize the ideas which were first givenexpression to by Swedenborg, and afterwards, althoughusually in a much modified form—consciously or uncon-sciously—taken up by other authors in cosmology, we findthe following: The planets of our solar system originate from the solar matter—taken up by Buffon, Kant, Laplace and others. The earth and other planets have gradually removed themselves from the sun and received a gradually length-ened time of revolution, a view again expressed by G. H.Darwin. The earth’s time of revolution, that is to say, the day’s length, has gradually increased—a view again expressed byG. H. Darwin.

These works were recognized at once asstandard works of reference and received the highest commenda-tion in the scientific press. Cerebral Cortex and the Soul’s Activity (1740s) At the International Swedenborg Congress in London in 1910,Martin Ramstrom, professor of anatomy at Uppsala University,spoke on Swedenborg’s concept that the cerebral cortex was the seatof psychical activity. Later that year, Ramstrom issued a greatlyexpanded monograph to the university that went a step further,concluding that Swedenborg viewed the cerebral cortex as the seatof all the activities of the human soul. In his summary, Ramstrom states that Swedenborg’s hypothesis that the cerebral cortex is the seat of psychical activity has beenessentially corroborated. That Swedenborg, with a methodologythat did not include exact methods of investigation, had arrived atalmost the same result as had been attained in Ramstrom’s timemarked his work as a work of genius. An article in the Journal of the American Medical Association 206, no. 4 (1968) by John Harold Talbott, titled “Natural Scientist,Neurophysiologist, Theologian,” explains that Swedenborg was notonly a theologian but also a pathfinder in medicine. This laudatoryessay was once kept in print by the Swedenborg Foundation. Anticipation of Kantian Ideas Immanuel Kant published a curious diatribe against Swedenborg in1766. There is no clear agreement among Kantian scholars as to whyit was written. In a lengthy and informed introduction to his transla-tion of Kant’s Traume eines Geistersehers, John Manolesco states, near the end, “That Kant was a secret believer, perhaps even a would-bedisciple of Swedenborg is much more plausible than his alleged fear ofridicule. He would never have wasted his time on studying the bulkyArcana Coelestia (Secrets of Heaven), if, as Cassirer himself remarked, there had not been a direct and strange connection between Swe-denborg’s thought and his own.” The most complete monograph(including translation) of Kant’s Dreams of a Spirit-Seer can be found372 PART4: S WEDENBORGIAN CONCEPTS"

This editor, in his second Australian lecture tour in 1980, gave one talk on “Some Thought Affinities between Immanuel Kant and Emanuel Swedenborg.” The interested reader is referred to the pub-lication that contains this lecture: Swedenborg and 20th CenturyThought (Sydney: Swedenborg Library & Enquiry Centre, 1981). Here let it suffice to note briefly some of the concepts dealt with. (a) Time and space. Stephan Korner wrote that for Kant, “to use a very crude analogy, space and time are the spectacles through whichour eyes are affected by objects. The spectacles are irremovable.”Swedenborg wrote in Secrets of Heaven §7381 (Arcana Coelestia), “Man can in no wise think without the idea of time and space,which adheres to almost everything which he thinks; if the ideafrom time and space were taken away from man, he would notknow what he thinks and scarcely whether he thinks.” (b) Relationship of space/time to God. Swedenborg solved the prob- lem to his satisfaction by defining natural time/space and spiritualtime/space differently. Kant tentatively dealt with it by positing dif-ferent modes of intuition of time/space: only God has original intu-itions, while all creatures have at best derivative intuitions. (c) Definition of “good.” Under his proposition that “nothing can possibly be conceived in this world, or even out of it, which can becalled good without qualification, except a good will,” Kant wrotethat “a good will is good not because of what it performs or effects,not by its aptness for attaining some proposed end, but simply byvirtue of the volition.” Swedenborg wrote that “the internal of aperson, and heaven in a person is charity, that is, willing well toanother” (Secrets of Heaven §4776). And elsewhere, “‘goodwill’ is benevolence toward others; . . . ‘good works’ are good actions thatresult from benevolence; . . . goodwill and faith are transient andexist only in our minds unless . . . they culminate in actions andbecome embodied in them” ( True Christianity §421). (d) “Ideas concerning the summum bonum.” Kant, after noting that the realization of the summum bonum requires a progress ad infinitum, goes on to state that this endless progress “is only possi- ble on the supposition of the immortality of the soul.” There aremany very similar statements in Swedenborg.

Concepts Bridging the Pre-theological and Theological “Life Essence” Swedenborg’s developing idea of the nature of our “life essence” can be delineated into two distinct phases or stages. These corre-spond in general to the periods before and after his illumination,that is, the opening of his spiritual senses and the consequent accessthis gave him to the spiritual world. The doctrine of the formerperiod is found principally in works written in the 1740s, namely,the published work Dynamics of the Soul’s Domain (Economy of theAnimal Kingdom), published in two volumes in 1740 and 1741; and the posthumous works Draft on the Fiber (The Fibre) (written around 1742), A Draft of a Rational Psychology (Rational Psychology)(written before or in 1742), and several of the short works found inthe volume Psychological Transactions and Other Posthumous Tracts(1734–1744), trans. Alfred Acton, 2nd ed. (Bryn Athyn, Pa.: Swe-denborg Scientific Association., 1984). The various treatments of the life essence concept are all con- cerned with Swedenborg’s protracted search for the soul. In thissearch, the life essence and relationship concepts overlap becauseboth are germane to his quest. In the former of these, our authoruses the traditional term “animal spirit” (which dates back at leastto the middle of the sixteenth century), but redefined by him. Thecommon seventeenth-century adjective spirituous is used by Swe- denborg in the phrase “spirituous fluid,” often used seemingly assynonymous with “animal spirit,” and both terms often inter-changeable with “soul.” He also uses the multi-meaning word374 PART4: S WEDENBORGIAN CONCEPTS"

Relationship Under this subheading, it becomes necessary to add to the workslisted in the section above as sources of the ideas to be mentioned,the following treatises from this period: The First Draft of ThreeTransactions on the Brain, vol. 1, written in 1738; Draft on the Reproductive Organs, written around 1743; Draft on the Five Senses, written before or during 1744; and Draft of a Hieroglyphic Key,written around 1742 (all published posthumously); and The Soul’s Domain (The Animal Kingdom), published in 1744–1745. Universal mathesis, or a universal mathematical philosophy (dealt with briefly above) must be called the first and most persistent con-cept of relationship that was considered essential by Swedenborg inhis pre-theological period. At the same time, he became aware thatseveral other subordinate or coordinate concepts had to be devel-oped if he were to be enabled to “climb from effects to principles,from the body to the soul.” In the work on reproductive organs, Swedenborg names thesePART4: S WEDENBORGIAN CONCEPTS 375"

We find, however, in his laterthought development that both this list and the titles in the listwere pleonastic and that they proved reducible to three at themost—correspondences, degrees, and influx, these being terms typ-ical of the writings of the theological period. For a reasonably brief survey of the development of these com- plex concepts (which includes several references to other helpfulrelated studies), see William R.

The survey referred to here, chapter 2, may be found in vol. 93, no.2 [April–June 1990]). What seems clear is that much of the painstaking development of concepts in his pre-theological period proved fully usable andadaptable to the new revelatory content of Swedenborg’s theologi-cal period. What seems equally clear is that there is still ample roomfor a number of fruitful studies of this transition period in his lifethat could easily qualify as topics for academic theses. 5 3.

Swift’sManual of the Doctrines of the New Church, quite a small book, has sixteen major divisions, roughly paralleling the chapter topicsin Swedenborg’s True Christianity (True Christian Religion).Synnestvedt’s The Essential Swedenborg has only two main parts, the first having ten subdivisions, the second having seven, but oneof these latter is further divided into eleven sub-groupings. Dole’sA Thoughtful Soul: Reflections from Swedenborg, one of the mostrecent and a relatively brief compendium, has ten chapters, withtitles not in any way whatever resembling those of any of theother compilations named. Thus, I feel in good company to state that, in the very brief sum- maries of concepts that follow, I have chosen (in a not untypicalSwedenborgian mode) to go my own way and divide them intofour main categories of concepts revealed to Swedenborg: (1) aboutGod, (2) about the Spiritual World, (3) about God’s Word to us,and (4) about ourselves and our intended destiny. In doing this, Ialso notify the reader that I make no claim that I am presenting acomplete list of Swedenborg’s key theological concepts. As noted in the introduction to this part 4, a number of the words and terms used to identify the concepts will be quite familiartraditional and biblical terms. But the reader is again alerted to thefact that, although Swedenborg seemed to like to use such familiarterms, almost without exception he redefined them to be in essencenew and unique theological concepts. At the same time, this is not to argue that Swedenborg devised a new religion. The approach we find in his writings is clearly andidentifiably Christian. But what is heralded is a new Christianity, a renewal and purifying of the Christian religion, with the primarydoctrine that God is one, both in essence and in person, and thatthe Lord Jesus Christ, risen and glorified, is that one God.

There are two constituents in the essence of God, namely, love and wisdom. There are three properties that constitute the essenceof his love, namely, to love others outside of itself, to desire to beone with others, and to render them blessed from itself. Divine love and wisdom are not in their essence thinkable, for they are infinite and thus transcend comprehension. But in theircorrespondential appearances, they are thinkable. To the eyes ofangels, the Lord appears as a sun, from which spiritual heat andlight go forth. Thus, by analogy, angels are able to think and knowthat they are sustained by this spiritual light and heat, that is,divine love and wisdom that constantly emanate from God. By correspondence, this analogy is also usable by persons on earth, who are able to think that, just as nature is sustained moment bymoment by the heat and light of the physical sun, so they are sus-tained spiritually by the divine love and wisdom of the Lord. The Lord is the universal human. The Lord Jesus Christ, who alone is fully human and from whom angels, spirits, and earthlyinhabitants are called collectively “human beings,” by his influxinto heaven causes the entire heaven to represent and resemble asingle person. By analogy, only that which is heavenly in nature inpersons on earth is truly human. The God of the new Christian church is the one visible God, in whom is the invisible, like a soul in its body. No person could beconjoined with God if this were not so, for all conjunction betweenGod and persons must be reciprocal, and such reciprocation isimpossible except with a visible God. Similarly, in all the heavens, there is no other idea of God than that he is a person, and that person is the Lord. Paul’s insight in hisletter to the Colossians (2:9) was verified to Swedenborg: that inJesus Christ, risen and glorified, dwells all the fullness of the God-head bodily. People both on earth and in heaven can know this. Biblical passages concerning the trinity in God are phrased in symbolic language. There is a divine trinity, but it is in the one per-son of the Lord, its distinguishable aspects being understood assoul, body, and resultant activity. By analogy, there is a trinity ineach person, which taken together constitutes one person: the soul,378 PART4: S WEDENBORGIAN CONCEPTS"

In the Lord, the trinity is infinite and thus divinebecause the Lord is life itself even as to his human. Wherever, in the Word, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are referred to, the distinguishable aspects of God’s nature are involved. Theunity of God in which there is a trinity, or the one God in whomthere is a trine, does not exist separately in the Father or the HolySpirit, but in the Lord alone, since the “Father” or “soul” of Godand the “Spirit” or “activity” of God exist in and come forth fromthe Lord only. Therefore, any biblical account that seems to refer toGod, Christ, or the Holy Spirit as separate beings is to be under-stood symbolically and analogically. Thus, the insight will be intosome aspect of the nature and activity of the one only God, not tothat of two or more separate divine beings. Divine love is the source and sustainer of all creation. Spiritual things can come forth from no other source than love, and creativelove can come forth only from the Lord, who is love itself. The universal purpose of all creation is that there be an eternal joining of the Creator with the created universe. This would not bepossible unless there were in that creation beings in which thedivine nature can “dwell,” because of the affinity of such personswith the divine. Thus, everything has been created for the use ofpersons; consequently, the uses of all created things ascend bydegrees from outmosts to persons and through persons to God.This has been called the “circle of life.” The specific purpose of creation is that there may be an ever- expanding heaven of angels from the human race, capable of receiv-ing and returning God’s love to eternity. Contrary to one persistent theological idea, God did not create the universe out of nothing. Nothing can be made out of nothing.All things have been created out of a substance that is substanceitself. That substance is divine love. It is from this source alone thatall things are formed and sustained. God created the physical universe to serve both as “clothing” to spiritual realities and as a plane on which persons can, if they will,become of their own free will spiritual and potentially angelicbeings.PART4: S WEDENBORGIAN CONCEPTS 379"

The humanity the Lord “put on” from theamenable, completely normal human mother Mary had the samepotential infirmities that were afflicting the human race. But bydrawing on the divine potential dwelling within, Jesus gradually,methodically, and completely faced and overcame the powers of thehells, restoring for all time a balance between heavenly and hellishforces impinging on persons on the earthly plane. This lifelongprocess of the Lord is what constitutes redemption, making indi-vidual salvation possible now and for all time. Revelations about the Spiritual World There is a real and eternal spiritual world. Its three distinct divi-sions are heaven, hell, and an intermediate world of spirits. Death is an orderly and necessary step in life. When a person’s body is no longer able to perform its functions in the naturalworld, functions that correspond to human thoughts and affec-tions, the person is said to “die.” The person does not die, but ismerely separated from the bodily part given for use on this earthlyplane. The person continues to live, for a person is not a person because of the body but because of the spirit. It is the spirit or soulthat thinks in a person, and thought together with affection is whatconstitutes a person. Thus, death is merely a person’s passing fromone world into another. As soon as one’s life signs have ceased, the person is immediately resuscitated in the world of spirits. This is done by the Lordthrough the instrumentality of the highest angels. Then, the personis guided through a process of self-examination and self-under-standing and is finally able of his or her own volition to choose aneternal home, either in heaven or in hell. No one is “rewarded” bybeing given entrance to heaven; nor is anyone “punished” by beingcondemned to hell. All in heaven and in hell are in their respectivedomains by their own free choice. After death, there is granted to every person ample means to amend thoughts and affections. All are taught and led by the Lord380 PART4: S WEDENBORGIAN CONCEPTS"

But those who while living in this world did not acknowledge God and who made no effort to shun evils as sins against God soongrow weary of hearing truths and withdraw as a matter of choice.In short, providence makes it possible for all to be “saved,” that is,to choose heaven, and the person who does not so choose is aloneresponsible. The term spirit is used to mean one who is temporarily in the first state after death called the world of spirits. The term angel means one who has finished the process of education and self-emendation and has thus been enabled to find a suitable place inheaven. Those who choose a place in hell are called either satans or devils. When the spirit of a person first enters the world of spirits, his or her face and tone of voice closely resemble those the person had inthe world. But subsequently the face and other features and actionsbecome quite different, gradually changing to conform to the per-son’s affections or ruling love. When the exteriors of the life of thespirit in the body end and those exteriors are set aside, the outwardappearance and former affectations change, and one looks and actsin full harmony with one’s inner being. Too many details of heavenly life are given to outline here; let it suffice to say that it is a real life, with real family dwellings, with adiversity of occupations, and delightful community life and partic-ipation. There are many children there, for all who die early, ininfancy or childhood, come directly into heaven and grow up there. Hell is basically an inverse, negative reflection of heaven, grossly distorted by the destructive power of evil characteristic of thosewho choose this life. There is no fire and brimstone, no arbitrarypunishments; evil takes its own toll, and hell is objectively a state ofmisery. But those in hell want it no other way.

There-fore there is in every expression in that Word an internal sense relat-ing to heavenly things, which is of such a nature that it conjoinsangelic minds with human minds. Many Christians readily say that the Word is divinely inspired and therefore holy. And yet, prior to this revelation through Swe-denborg, it was not known where in the Word its holiness or divin-ity resided. For in its literal sense, it appears like ordinary writing,sometimes foreign in style, sometimes not seeming to be more loftyor brilliant than other contemporary writings. Thus those whoeither do not choose to worship God or who revere things of theworld more than God may easily fall into the error of denying thatthere can be anything holy about the Word. In short, such personsare left in freedom to accept the Word as divine or to reject it. Those, however, who place God before nature and who gen- uinely seek truth readily accept the many statements in the letterthat identify it as the Word of the Lord. The minds of these personsare open to insights into the reality and necessity of revelation. Forwithout revelation, there can be no knowledge and consequentlyno acknowledgment of God. It is, in fact, only through the revela-tions that have been given that people have been able to approachGod, to receive the benefits of influx, and from being natural tobecome spiritual. The books of the Word are all those that have a continuous and connected inner sense. The books of the Word in the Old Testa-ment are the five books of Moses, Joshua, Judges, Samuel 1 and 2,Kings 1 and 2, Psalms, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lamentations, Ezekiel,Daniel, Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Hab-bakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi; and in theNew Testament, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, and Revelation. The Gospels contain words of the Lord himself, all of which have concealed in them a spiritual meaning, through which communica-tion with heaven is possible. The writings of the apostles, althoughuseful books for the church, do not contain inner meanings. All the details of the outmost or literal sense of the Word are adapted to the comprehension of the sensory person, thus also tochildren and the guileless. For this reason, most things in the literal382 PART4: S WEDENBORGIAN CONCEPTS"

There are many such statements in theletter, such as that God is angry, that he tempts, that he casts intohell; also that at the Last Judgment the Lord is literally to floatdown to earth on the clouds, that the sun and moon will cease togive light, and that the stars will fall. It is only from a spiritual per-spective that these can be seen as symbols of inner changes that cantake place in any person, not predictions of natural calamities. Because the literal sense can be misunderstood in such ways, it serves as a guard to the genuine truths concealed within it, thatthese truths may not suffer injury. No lasting harm is done whenone person understands the sense of the letter in one way andanother in another way; but harm is done when false notions areadduced that are contrary to divine truth, and this is only done bythose who choose to confirm themselves in falsities. Every person, place, thing, and event in the Word is symbolic of some spiritual reality and corresponds to that reality. These corre-spondential meanings constitute the spiritual sense of the Word. Sothe spiritual sense is not apparent in the letter; it is within the literalsense, as a soul is in a body, as the thought of the intellect is in theeyes, or the affection of love is in the face. It is that sense chieflythat makes the Word spiritual and thus truly the Word of the Lord. However, in the literal sense, the Word is in its fullness, its holi- ness, and its power. For the literal sense is the basis, the container,and the support of the inner spiritual meanings. The Word is so written that the expressions in it, in their series, involve whole series of spiritual ideas—ideas that do not appear toa person unless the person is acquainted with correspondences. Inthis way, the divine lies hidden in the Word. Correspondences have all power, so that what is done on earth according to correspondence has a direct effect in heaven, for corre-spondences are from the Divine. Those who are living in the goodof love and of faith are said to be “in correspondence,” and theDivine is able to act in and through them. The Word of the Lord is such that it gives life to the person who thirsts, that is, who desires life. This is taught in John’s gospel.

Revelations about Humankind and Our Intended Destiny Love and wisdom, and therefore intention and discernment, makeup a person’s essential life. Hardly anyone knows what life is. Whenpeople think about it, it seems elusive, something that defies con-ceptualization. It seems that way because people do not realize thatGod alone is life and that his life is divine love and divine wisdom.So we can see that our own life is no different and that there is lifein us to the extent that we receive it. As love ebbs away from any-one, that person becomes sluggish; and as wisdom ebbs away, he orshe becomes dull. If both love and wisdom ebb away completely,that individual is terminated. Divine love cannot help existing and becoming present in others whom it loves and by whom it is loved. However, this could notoccur if those others (namely, human beings) had in themselvessomething of the infinite, or something of the essence and life ofintrinsic love, or something of the divine. If there were actuallysomething of the infinite and divine in us, God would not be lovedby others; he would be loving himself. For the infinite or divine isunique and indivisible. For this reason, mutual love can only occurwith others in which there is nothing of the intrinsic divine. A human being, regarded intrinsically and as to proprium (that is, sense of selfhood), is no different from a beast. The five senses arevery similar, appetites similar, natural desires similar, as well as allaffections. Even a person’s best loves are similar, such as loving com-panions, loving offspring, and loving one’s married partner. A per-son, however, is superior to beasts in having an inner life. That lifeis the life of love and the life of faith derived from the Lord. If these384 PART4: S WEDENBORGIAN CONCEPTS"

All people, in respect to the interiors that belong to their minds, are spirits clothed in this world with a material body. The body isunder the direction of the thought of the spirit and under the con-trol of its affections. The human race, as noted above, is the foundation on which heaven is based. For this reason, human beings were created last, forthat which is created last is the basis for all that precedes. Becauseall creation came from God, persons were created forms of divineorder. People are the means by which the natural world and the spiritual world are joined. It is, in fact, to the extent that a person becomesspiritual that he or she becomes a medium of conjunction. The human soul is a person’s inmost and finest essence. But an essence must have a form, and the soul is the form of all things oflove, called affections, and all things of wisdom, called perceptions. A person is not born into any knowledge, still less into any intel- ligence or wisdom, but only into a capability for receiving andbecoming imbued with them. This is effected in a twofold way: thedivine flows in by an internal way; the world flows in by an exter-nal way. These forces meet within the person, and then, to theextent that the person chooses to be enlightened by the Divine, theperson gradually enters into a state of wisdom. Every person has a sense or feeling of selfhood, an illusion of self- guidance necessary in the process of personal sanctification. Swe-denborg refers to this sense of selfhood with the word proprium; his usual word for personal sanctification is regeneration. It is a law of divine providence that a person act from freedom in accordance with reason; also that everything a person wills, thinks,speaks, and does should appear to be entirely from self. Withoutthis appearance, no one could feel that anything was his or herown, and thus the person could not be his or her own person.Without this sense of proprium, nothing could be imputed to the person, and it would become a matter of indifference whether theperson did good or evil, or had faith in God or a persuasion of hell.In short, the person would not be a person or be truly human.

What is more, the Lord maintainsthem in that state, for if he did not, they would not be able to bereformed. Indeed, if they were told before regeneration that theyare incapable of doing anything good by themselves or of thinkinganything that is true by themselves, they would either lapse into themistake of supposing that they must wait for an influx into the willand thought, and not attempt a thing without it, or into the mis-take of supposing that, if good and truth do not originate in them-selves, they would be like machines without a mind or any controlof their own. Therefore, they are allowed at first to think that goodand truth originate in themselves. But after the process of regeneration is under way, it is gradually instilled into them that the situation is different and that every-thing good and true comes wholly from the Lord. And as they growmore nearly perfect, it is also instilled into them that whatever doesnot come from the Lord is evil and false. Those who are beingregenerated are led, if not during their lifetime then in the next life,not only to know this but to see it with perception. Human free will is essential to regeneration. Unless a person is interiorly in freedom in respect to all affections and all thoughts,the person can never be set in order so that good and truth can takeroot. This freedom is maintained by the Lord in a way analogous toa balance scale in which equal weights are placed on either side. Ina similar way, the Lord maintains a constant balance of good andevil influences on every person. But the person is not conscious ofthis. It is one of God’s gifts that people should feel life as if it weretheir own, and it is God’s will that we so feel it. This is so that wemay feel that it is entirely of ourselves when we choose to live inaccordance with the laws of order in the Word, and thus disposeourselves for the reception of God’s love. Nevertheless, God perpet-ually holds his finger, as it were, on the cross bar above the scale,moderating our freedom of choice, but never violating it bycompulsion. God did not create evil but, in order that there might be real choices, permitted the human race to introduce it.

Thislove is truly human, for there is in it a spiritual element that distin-guishes it from the natural love that is found in brute animals. There is no such thing as “original sin” or “hereditary evil.” No one is born into actual evils but only into an inclination towardevils, with a greater or lesser proclivity toward particular evils. Con-sequently, after death, a person is not judged from any inheritedtendency toward evil, but only from the actual evils that the personhas accepted and acted in accordance with. It is also true that we do not inherit actual good but only tenden- cies to be good. There are many who enjoy a natural good and kinddisposition from inheritance and who seem naturally to enjoydoing good to others. But if they do not become imbued at thesame time with the principles of doing good from the Word, theydo not develop a conscience, for conscience does not come fromnatural or inherited good tendencies and a life in accordance withthese tendencies. If any persons come into the spiritual world inthis state, they have to go through a difficult process of testing andtrial, involving having principles of good and truth impressed onthem. It is only in this way that they can receive a heavenlyconscience. Leading a heaven-bound life is not as hard as people believe. Some people think it is hard to lead a spiritual life because theyhave heard that a person needs to renounce the world, give up theappetites that are associated with the body and the flesh and livelike spiritual beings.

Some original manuscripts are alsolocated in the Diocesan Library, Linköping, and some are in theRoyal Library, Stockholm. What may be of more significance to scholars in other parts of the world is that a great many of these manuscripts have beenreproduced photographically, and sets of these are in the collectionsof a number of libraries. In the order in which they were produced,these sets are called (1) Photolithographs, comprising ten volumes;(2) Phototypes, comprising eighteen volumes; and (3) Photostats,comprising twenty-one volumes.

T HEDUFTY DOCUMENTS . In his Swedenborg Birthday Lecture, London 1973 (printed in the April–June 1973 issue of The New Church Magazine ), Dennis Duckworth noted that six names stand out as eminent in the field of research in documents concerning Swedenborg: J. F . I. Tafel of T ubingen, Germany; J. H. Smithson ofManchester, England; R. L. Tafel, who served the church in bothAmerica and England; J. J. G. Hyde of England; A. H.

(T woother researchers, who worked almost exclusively in America, aregiven passing tribute: C. T. Odhner and A. Acton.) Stroh had proposed to the Swedenborg Society a new six-volume edition of all the known documents, to be arranged as follows: (1)prolegomena and memorial volume, (2) Swedenborg’s journals andscientific letters, (3) Swedenborg’s theological letters, (4) theGothenburg Consistory minutes, (5) the Gothenburg Consistoryand the Swedish Ecclesiastical Court, and (6) Minor documents,notes, chronological list, and indices. However, in 1919, the Swe-denborg Society expressed its “complete and final negation” ofinterest in the publication of these documents. That this decision was neither complete nor final is attested to by the fact that, in 1926, the Society appointed Dufty editor to carryon where Stroh left off and to produce a new edition of documents.He was also authorized to visit Sweden, if necessary, to collect asmuch of the Stroh material as he could find. He did not in fact goto Sweden, but, in 1927, a case of documents from Uppsala arrivedfor him in London. As time went on, the new editor was askedmore than once to present a contents plan, but there is no recordthat he ever did. Finally, in 1946, the Society decided to go aheadand make plans to publish all documents in hand at that time, bothin their original languages and in English translation, realizing itwould be a colossal task. It is not known to this editor how far this plan progressed. What is known is that, in 1948, the first of the two volumes of Letters and Memorials of Emanuel Swedenborg, edited by Alfred Acton, appeared in print, published in America by the Swedenborg Scien-tific Association. As Duckworth reports, this was a “bolt out of theblue” for Dufty, who complained of the action as “cutting theground from beneath my feet.” Soon after this, Dufty retired fromactive ministerial work and also relinquished his editorship of thedocuments. The results of his labors may be seen in the more than twenty large, tightly packed file boxes of papers, mostly handwritten, cur-rently housed in the Archives strong room of the SwedenborgSociety, London (my thanks to Nancy Dawson for this updatedPART5: D OCUMENTARY COLLECTIONS AND BOOKSELLERS 395"

They contain nearly one thousand distinct docu- ments, some of which fill from ten to thirty foolscap pages each.This editor arranged to photocopy and bring back to the UnitedStates both Duckworth’s notebook, listing in chronological orderand identifying all these documents briefly, and the complete 5″×8″ card file of the documents, containing detailed information about the contents of the documents. These reference materials arenow on file in the library of the Swedenborgian House of Studies,Berkeley, California. At the time Duckworth wrote his article in 1973, there seemed to be clear intent on the part of the Swedenborg Society to sort outand publish all the “new” documents that could be found in theDufty collection. To date, so far as this editor could determine, noactual publishing of any of this material has been done. (b) General Conference of the New Church, 20 Bloomsbury Way The General Conference and the Swedenborg Society share the same headquarters. The following is a description of some of thearchival items in the strong room of the General Conference exam-ined by this editor in July 1986. (1) A small (ca. 6″×8 ″) dark-green leather-bound book titled “Memoirs of Joseph Proud.” It notes that Proud was born March 11 OS, 1745, and married February 3, 1769. Ten children wereborn, 1770–1785. A second marriage yielded three more children. The “Memoirs” begin as of August 21, 1822, and cover ninety- five numbered pages in the first part, concluding on August 31,1822. This is followed by the second part, which begins as fol-lows: We now proceed to notice the more particular Circum- stances & Striking Events in which I have been concerned or which have come within my observation, the 33 years ofmy being in the New Church . . . the pleasant, & unpleas- antEvents which took place the first two or three years of my residence in Birmingham, I have already related.Therefore I shall only observe here that Dr. Priestley, who396 P ART5: D OCUMENTARY COLLECTIONS AND BOOKSELLERS"

(2) A volume of similar size to the above, of Rev. Edward Madeley, listing his Scripture readings and sermon titles, plus place of deliv-ery, from May 1819 through May 1876. His elevation to the rankof ordaining minister on October 30, 1842, is noted. (3) Reprints (twenty copies) of a “Circular Letter calling The First General Conference of ’The New Jerusalem Church,’” datedDecember 7, 1788. The inside front and back covers explain thatthese reprints were made in 1883—being the centenary of theorganization known as “The New Jerusalem Church.” (The appar-ent discrepancy in dates is dealt with.) This explanation is signedJohn Rabone, Birmingham, August 1883. The circular itself has forty-two numbered points, each being “validated” by a reference in the theological works. Signers of theoriginal document were Thomas Wright, President; Robert Hind-marsh, T reasurer and Secretary; John Augustus T ulk; Thomas Will-don; Richard Thompson; Isaac Hawkins; Manoah Sibly; SamuelSmith; and James Hindmarsh at Great East Cheap, London,December 7, 1788. (4) A leather-bound volume, ca. 6 1⁄2″×91⁄2″, titled on the spine “Stephani Lexicon.” The title page reads in part, “Lexicon Graeco- latinum, seu, Epitome Thesavri Graecae Lingvae . . . Ex Typis Soci-etatios Helv. Cladorianae, M.DC.XXIII.” On the title page, in what appears to be Swedenborg’s handwriting, is “Jesper Swedberg,” fol-lowed by an obscured date, and then, “Em. Swedberg, 14 Sept.,Anno 1700.” There are a few marginal notes and underliningswhich may or may not be in Swedenborg’s hand. On the inside ofthe front cover is an explanation of how the volume came into thehands of the Society. (5) A first edition of De Infinito (1734) by Swedenborg, bought at the auction of the library of Hermann Boerhaave, the famous Dutch anatomist. The date of the auction is not noted.PART5: D OCUMENTARY COLLECTIONS AND BOOKSELLERS 397"

Mennander.Later this set was separated and only the last two volumes foundtheir way into the library of the General Conference in London.For the unusual final destination of the first six volumes, see theaccount under “Berkeley, California,” below. What is unusualabout this set is that it contains a number of annotations in Swe-denborg’s own hand. 5 2.

There are archival records covering much of the Swedenborgian church and publishing activity in the north of England on file inthe North of England New Church House in Manchester. This building is also the locale of the Manchester Society of the New Church, and in their library there is a most interesting first-edition set of Arcana Coelestia (Secrets of Heaven), which is clearly marked as having been the property of Benedict Chastanier, No.62, Tottenham Court Road [London]. Chastanier, who (according to Odhner’s Annals) died in Scotland in 1806, has been called the father of the New Church in France. Itis known that he spent much time in Great Britain and was a pio-neer translator of Swedenborg into French. It is not clear to thiseditor how his annotated edition of the Arcana came into the pos-session of the Manchester Society of the New Church. It may benoted that a biographical sketch of him appears in the Tafel Docu-ments, volume 2, and a chapter is devoted to him in Karl-Eric Sjö- den’s study, Swedenborg en France (see “Theses and Dissertations,” Part 2, above). What follows are some of the particulars about Chastanier’s Latin Arcana observed by this editor. Written on the title page of volume 1 is “Autore Emmanuele Swedenborg.” Above the date [ MDCCXLIX ]i s “Londini” and below it, “e typis Harir Hart Typographi, in Crane- Court Fleet-Street.” Scattered through the eight volumes are a number of marginal notes.

Some years later, while the New Church TheologicalSchool was still located just off the Harvard campus, it was discoveredthat some of the volumes given by Hill had marginal annotations thatwere unmistakably in Swedenborg’s handwriting. It was also noted that Hill had not been able to procure a copy of volume 8, and so had painstakingly hand-copied the chapter sum-maries only, had the manuscript volume bound, and presented italong with the first seven volumes to Harvard. An arrangement was made with Harvard by the New Church Theological School to exchange a complete and perfect set ofArcana Coelestia (Secr ets of Heaven) for the incomplete but anno- tated set Hill had presented to the college. Later, it was learnedthat the first six volumes of this set were actually part of a set theauthor had presented to Bishop Mennander in 1762. For moreinformation on the Mennander set, see above under “London,The Swedenborg Society.” This editor was informed in a private communication from Nancy Dawson, of the Swedenborg Society, that another set of theArcana containing Swedenborg’s annotations was once owned by Raymond Pitcairn and is now housed and cataloged in the JohnPitcairn Library. THEWILLIAM JAMES TRUNK This trunk, given to the old Swedenborg School of Religion in 1964by John S. R. James, was originally owned by Henry James Sr. It waspossibly bought by him especially to serve as a sort of traveling libraryto house his Swedenborgian collection, which for a number of yearshe took with him from and to Europe. After his death in 1882,Henry Sr.’s trunk came into his son William’s possession. Its contentswere incorporated into his son’s library, and William then used thetrunk simply as a travel trunk for several of his trips abroad. William, however, was well aware of the trunk’s original function and eventually placed his father’s Swedenborg collection back in itand pasted a neatly marked label on the lid: “Henry James, Sr.Books by Swedenborg & Wilkinson. Annotated.” Subsequently, itremained for some time in the attic of the James residence in Cam-bridge, Massachusetts.PART5: D OCUMENTARY COLLECTIONS AND BOOKSELLERS 413"

J. G. Wilkinson. In a letter by Tomas Spiers, dated May 17,1973, it is noted that there were some eighty-six letters written byWilkinson to Henry James Sr. between February 1, 1844, and Febru-ary 28, 1858, plus fragments of three undated letters. The correspon-dence between James and Wilkinson has not been located. The Swedenborg Foundation arranged to have photocopies of these letters made and deposited sets at two major Swedenborgianlibraries in America, one at Urbana University in Ohio and theother at the former Swedenborg School of Religion (SSR). Thelibrarian at SSR felt the James T runk would be an appropriate placeto store these letters, and they were filed there, along with anno-tated books and pamphlets of the elder Henry James, until the col-lection moved to Berkeley. To better preserve the James T runkCollection, individual archival boxes have now been made for eachbook and pamphlet, and the letters stored in an archival box. Thecollection is currently kept as a separate special collection andshelved near the James T runk. For a detailed list and description of the contents of this trunk, see the article by Raymond H.
