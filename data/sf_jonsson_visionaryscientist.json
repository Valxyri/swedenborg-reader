      "text": "Preface to the first edition It is certainly not surprising that a great deal has been written about Emanuel Swedenborg ever since the end of the eighteenth century.Great authors normally attract a host of critics. But Swedenborgianspecialists comprise a rather unusual group in the sense of the words ofthe Master that he who is not with me is against me. Consequently,there probably is a need for a new study by someone who is neitherconvert nor maligner. It was thus especially difficult not to accept the offer of the pub- lishers of the Twayne World Authors Series to write about my remark-able compatriot—perhaps the most remarkable of them all—eventhough it would be preposterous to attempt to compress the entirestory of Swedenborg’s life and works into the limited space at my disposition. My main intention has been to approach Swedenborg’s writings from the standpoint of the history of ideas, to try to treat them as a rarefruit on the tree of European science. After an introductory biographi-cal sketch, Chapter 2 is devoted to Swedenborg’s philosophy of nature,with the emphasis on cosmology and the theory of particles. The third chapter discusses his shift from the mechanistic concept of nature to anorganic philosophy, which means that the great volumes and the evengreater aspirations of the years 1734–1745 are the focus of attention. Chapter 4 provides a more detailed examination of Swedenborg’s at-tempts to force his way into the concealed domains of the soul with the assistance of some metaphysical doctrines. The fifth chapter analyzes instill greater detail what Swedenborg called a mathematical philosophyof universals and his doctrine of correspondence. The reason for such detailed attention is that the theory of correspondence is one of theconcepts for which Swedenborg is most widely known and also because vii"

In Chapter 6, “The Religious Crisis,” I turn to Swedenborg’s activities after 1745, when the gates tothe spiritual world, to heaven and to hell, were opened for him; this sec-tion is primarily concerned with the Journal of Dreams and the superb drama of the creation De Cultu et Amore Dei (The Worship and Love of God). The seventh chapter cites a number of examples of the varioustypes of visions encountered in his manuscripts and published works;it also attempts to convey a sense of his completely humanized spiritualworld. Chapter 8 discusses Swedenborg’s concept of God and his viewof the Bible and other essential theological problems, and the last chap-ter traces some of the channels of his influence on Western literature upto our own times.

Returning to my text after thirty years hasbeen a rather complicated experience, including quite a few tempta-tions of substantial changes of some parts, but I have tried to confinemyself to making only necessary corrections and additions. There hasbeen very little time for systematic research work in later years becauseof other academic duties, so maybe my revision has unintentionally be-come too restrictive. Nevertheless, I hope that it may serve as an intro-duction to one of the most fascinating writers in Western literature.

Eliot coined the phrase “dissociation of sensibility” to define the impact on Western intellectual history of the scientific breakthroughof the seventeenth century. As a result of a tremendous expansion inknowledge combined with attacks on the closed medieval interpreta-tion of the world, the traditional view of humankind and of the worldwas thoroughly shaken and in its place came confusion and anguish.In his agonized The First Anniversary, John Donne bewails the fact that the new science “calls all in doubt” and demolishes all harmony—“allcoherence gone.” Nature’s great book was no longer open for all to readof the glory of the Creator, as the psalmist said, but was intelligibleonly to those who spoke its tongue, the language of mathematics. Thatgift, then as now, was reserved for the few, and the poet was rarely oneof them. A rift appeared between the exact language of formulae and the symbolism of poetry; in our time this rift has become what manyregard as a threatening abyss. The “century of genius” produced a miraculous development in the formulation of mathematics, to the point that the most remotemovements in the macrocosm could be explained by formulae similar to those that dealt with the behavior of everyday objects.

Eventhough the many attempts to realize the dream of a perfect universallanguage had not been successful, it is easy to imagine how vitally im-portant the dream might become to one who had experienced it withall the emotional intensity of youth. From this mathematical sensibil-ity sprang the new rational systems of thought, which strove to incor-porate the innumerable scientific discoveries into new syntheses. It is impossible to say who made the most significant contribu- tions to the intellectual life of the seventeenth century, but the answeris unequivocal in the environment that shaped Emanuel Swedenborg:René Descartes. Although he was by no means the first to attack Aris-totelian university philosophy, Descartes’s assault was the most de-structive one. Using radical doubt as a methodological tool, heshattered the exquisite edifice erected by the Scholastics, persistinguntil he had reached what he regarded as an absolutely stable groundfor thought: the existence of the thinking individual. It was upon thisground that Descartes’ system was built, but it differed in principlefrom the lost unity in its dualistic character. The material world withextension as its attribute was regarded as utterly different from psychi-cal reality in which thought rules, and there was no real communica-tion between these two worlds. This immediately created the problemof explaining the actually experienced interaction between soul andbody in man, which came to be one of the most actively discussedproblems in the succeeding hundred years. It was his attempts to find asolution that brought Emanuel Swedenborg to the gates of the spiri-tual world. Swedenborg received his academic training at the University of Uppsala during the first decade of the eighteenth century. AlthoughDescartes had been at the court of Queen Christina (1632–1654) dur-ing the last four months of his life—his delicate health could not standthe winter climate of Stockholm—his philosophy did not win accep-tance at the university until late in the seventeenth century and onlyafter harrowing struggles.

      "text": "theologians believed Cartesianism would inevitably lead to. This opin- ion was also shared by Voltaire in his book on Newton’s philosophy, is-sued as late as 1731, and La Mettrie honored Descartes as “theintellectual ancestor of L’homme machine.” 1In Sweden, the argument was terminated in 1689 by royal decree from the absolute monarch.The result, according to the most probable interpretation, was some-what of a victory for Descartes’s theological opponents: his principlescould only be applied to the natural sciences and to philosophy, andany encroachment on theological domains would be repulsed. 2 The battle about Descartes’s philosophy is an indication of the powerful position of theology and the Lutheran clergy in Sweden inthe days when the country was a great power, as well as of the hysteri-cal suspicion of all innovations. But the distrust of the new science onthe part of European theologians was not wholly unjustified. At thesame time, the great majority of the natural scientists of the day—many of them truly devout men—were extremely anxious to save themain tenets of the Christian faith. The host of anatomists includedsuch dedicated Catholic converts as the Danes Steno and Winslow, amystic like Swammerdam, and scientists like Méry and Heister, forwhom even the tissues of the body bore witness to the glory of God.For a number of geniuses, led by Isaac Newton, perusal of the book ofnature found its self-evident complement in study of the revelations ofthe Scriptures, an attitude that caused many of them to penetrate thetexts in their original versions and to contribute to their interpretation.The development of microscopic techniques revealed an unknown world, and from this encounter were born the most jubilant paeans tothe glory of the Lord. In ingenious philosophical syntheses, Male- branche and Leibniz, inspired by Descartes, were able to combine thenew science with profound religious experience. But the intellectual climate became increasingly chilly for ortho- dox Christianity during the course of the eighteenth century. In thelong run, skepticism and disbelief grew ever stronger in the wake of the new science. Enlightened European thought became ever less inclined to listen to a gospel that was often empty words with nopower to influence clerical conduct.

But the churches were attacked not only by radical elementsin the Enlightenment. In Protestant territory, an emotional protestagainst orthodoxy developed toward the end of the seventeenth cen-tury, taking the form of a series of new sects. At first these sects werepersecuted with the same harshness as in the century of the religiouswars, but with the passing years, the demand of the Enlightenment forreligious tolerance gained increasing acceptance. Radical pietisticgroups showed signs of an unhealthy exaltation, a repugnant obsessionwith the mystery of the stigmata, and grossly superstitious forms ofspiritualism. Martin Lamm, the great Swedish scholar who wrote an excellent book on Swedenborg in 1915, has coined the phrase “romanticism ofthe Era of Enlightenment” to characterize the many expressions ofemotional revolt against the worship of reason and the utilitarian ide-ology of that age. Lamm’s term allows us to stress that no absolutechange of climate occurred with the romantic breakthrough in thedecades on either side of the turn of the century in 1800. From ourperspective, it was more a change in nuance and a reaction against theideals that had guided the previous generation. It meant, among otherthings, that the rationalism of the seventeenth century was reassessedand won new disciples. We may recall that the central organism con-cept of Romanticism was inspired by a reinterpretation of Leibniz, as aresult of the publication in 1765 of his hitherto unknown Nouveaux Essais sur l’Entendement Humain and also that Spinoza—that feared and despised pantheist—was eagerly read and loved by the young Goethe, for example. In many cases, however, these connections are difficult to discern. It is particularly hard in Swedenborg’s case, due to his having assumed prophetic dimensions following his call in 1745. It may seem risky orpresumptuous to evaluate according to usual historical categories aman who saw himself as an emissary of God and looked upon his ac-tivities as an interpreter of the Scriptures as the return of the Messiah.

      "text": "support in the religious–historical view that the assumption of a reli- gious role is always dependent on the entire makeup of the individual,including his level of education. As we shall see later, the events of themid-1740s did not mark a complete break in Swedenborg’s develop-ment. It is true that he almost entirely gave up his research in the nat-ural sciences; but as an interpreter of the Bible, he was able to use thesame methods as before, namely, to annotate the texts and provide hispersonal interpretation. He retained more or less intact the philosoph-ical position at which he had arrived before his call, and for those whodo not adhere to the faith of his disciples, it is his vision of the condi-tions of mankind that are fascinating, not his biblical writings as such. From a profane point of view, Swedenborg’s theory of correspon- dence is of central importance. In his great essay on the poetry of Vic-tor Hugo, written in 1861, Baudelaire praised Swedenborg for havingtaught us that “heaven is a Great Man: that everything, form, move-ment, quantity, color, odor, both in the spiritual world and in nature, issignificant, reciprocal, converse, correspondent.” 3This may sound like an inexact variation of a Platonic interpretation of the universe, but ithas its principal sources in the thought of the times. To prove this, con-siderable attention will have to be paid to much that is bizarre and ob-solete in the beliefs and thinking of the seventeenth and eighteenthcenturies; and it can be stressed at this point that Swedenborg is nei-ther an easy nor an immediately appealing writer, not even if onetranslates his sometimes rather uninspired Latin. But thrilling experi-ences await those who have the patience to try to penetrate Sweden-borg’s environment. To the man himself, his decades of struggling withdisparate tendencies in the knowledge of the time yielded assurance and spiritual peace within the framework of a highly original form ofChristianity. Bearing in mind his point of departure, one can borrow Eliot’s phrase and assert that Swedenborg personally overcame the“dissociation of sensibility” of the seventeenth century. This may be the reason that so many great poets—from Blake to Yeats and Borges,Balzac and Baudelaire to Valéry, Stagnelius to Strindberg and Ekelund,to name a few—were attracted to him.

      "text": "literary history, Swedenborg is certainly the most influential of Swedish authors. The Man and His Work A few words need to be said about the facts of Swedenborg’s life. Be-cause many people around the world have long regarded him as aprophet of the Lord, whose every word must be retained, both bio-graphically significant documents and the great majority of his manu-scripts have been published. American Swedenborgians, in particular,have made a magnificent contribution in this respect, especiallythrough R.L. Tafel’s three great volumes of documents and through al-most twenty volumes of photostat copies of original manuscripts. Swe-denborgian research owes a great debt of gratitude to the generosity ofthese enthusiasts, but it is a pity that, to a certain extent, the work ofpublication was done in a way that does not meet scholarly standards.The documents have been translated into English for obvious reasons,but this entailed some misunderstandings of the texts; and, when man-uscripts were photographed, the enormous amount of material wasedited in such a way that the most important parts from the point ofview of historical research were often left out. To appreciate Sweden-borg’s erudition and to recognize his sources of inspiration, it is stillnecessary to consult the manuscripts, which have been kept in the li-brary of the Royal Academy of Sciences in Stockholm since December1772, when the permanent secretary paid the haulage cost for a chestcontaining some 20,000 handwritten pages. A tremendous amount ofwork still remains to be done before all of these manuscripts will havebeen analyzed. It is nevertheless easy to select the basic biographical data from Tafel’s collection of documents. It is an odd coincidence that the man who is perhaps the most widely known Swedish writer in the English-speaking world bore a name with a direct association to his mother country. However, the prefix actually derives from the ancestral estate,Sweden, in the neighborhood of the town of Falun in Dalecarlia.

Jesper Swedberg was born in 1656 and in the course of his long life attained the highest positions in the church, bishop in 1702 and doctorof theology in 1705. According to the custom of the day, Bishop Swed-berg’s wife and children were ennobled, after which the name waschanged to the more lustrous “Swedenborg” in 1719. Jesper Swedberghas become somewhat of a symbol for the type of piety prevalent atthe time and of the strong self-reliance and sense of power of theSwedish clergy. In his lively and colorful memoirs, he obeyed the Scrip-tures and did not hide his light under a bushel. Grandiose, blustering,self-assured, unquestioningly devout, and artlessly naive, an egocentricof colossal dimensions, but indubitably a man with a tremendous ca-pacity for work and an unusual feeling for the demands of his highcalling, manifested not least by his efforts to create a hymnal for theSwedish church—this is how one can summarize the impression madeby his autobiography, which is one of the most vivid personal docu-ments of the Sweden of a few centuries ago. Swedenborg had his roots in Bergslagen, the mining district, on both his mother’s and father’s sides; and, even though the father hadchosen a career in the clergy, it was natural for the son to become anofficial in the Royal Board of Mines. His maternal grandfather, Al-brecht Behm, was a prosperous mine owner, who also bore the sametitle that his famous grandson would one day be given, namely, asses-sor of the Board of Mines, the government agency that supervised theimportant mining industry in the country. When in 1683 the penniless regimental pastor Jesper Swedberg married Sara Behm, he acquired agreat deal of worldly goods into the bargain, and even though severalsiblings eventually arrived to share the Behm gold, it constituted to-gether with other inheritances the financial basis for Swedenborg’s ac-tivity as a writer; although he lived economically as a bachelor, hisextensive travels and the publication of his vast scientific and theo- sophical works required considerable expenditures.

Little is known of his studies and even less of his relationship with his domineering fa-ther: there was little interest in psychological analysis in those days,and Jesper Swedberg’s memoirs have nothing revealing to say about hischildren. Swedberg remarried in 1697, but Emanuel appears to havereacted entirely positively to his stepmother, a wealthy widow namedSara Bergia. At the same time, it is reasonable to assume that the pres-sure from his father was very strong, and certain letters written whenhe was in his twenties seem to reveal mild reactions of protest. Butthese date from a much later period, and it should be recalled thatEmanuel remained at Uppsala when his father moved to Skara asbishop in 1703. In the sensitive years of his puberty, he found a secondhome with his oldest sister and her husband, who could be seen as asecond father, a spiritual father. Swedenborg’s brother-in-law was Erik Benzelius, Jr., one of the greatest figures in the intellectual history of Sweden. In his home, theyoung student came into early contact with a many-faceted scholarlyideal, which had its roots in solid knowledge of the classics but also in-cluded the latest natural sciences. Benzelius could describe the Euro-pean centers of learning he had come to know during his studiesabroad in the last three years of the seventeenth century, and Emanuelprobably read the lively correspondence that Benzelius, as university li-brarian, maintained with the great scholars of the period. Benzeliuscould tell of his meetings with some of them, not least the brilliantLeibniz, on whom he had made a good impression, and he could point to the practicable results which could be reasonably anticipated fromthe scientific breakthrough of the seventeenth century. Benzelius him-self worked eagerly at spreading the new knowledge; and, in the tragic autumn of the 1710 plague, he took the initiative for the creation of Sweden’s first learned society, Collegium Curiosorum, the Society of the Enquiring, in Uppsala, a modest counterpart of the Royal Society in London and the Académie des Sciences in Paris. The basis for the discussions in this society consisted in part of re- ports from two correspondents, Christopher Polhem and EmanuelSwedberg.

His interests differed from theirs, however. Emanuel Swedbergtraveled first to England in order to familiarize himself with the newnatural sciences. In letters to Benzelius, he wrote that he had an “im-moderate desire” for mathematics and its applications to astronomyand mechanics. Before his departure, Emanuel had prepared himself by collecting material for an investigation in the advances of mathematics duringthe most recent centuries, and in the first of his interesting letters toBenzelius, he told of his daily readings of Newton. Writers on Sweden-borg usually claim that the young scholar met Newton and listened tohis discourses, although we have no proof of this. 4On the other hand, he did meet great men in the scientific world, including Flamsteed,Halley, Chamberlain, and Woodward. In addition to learning practicalmechanical skills from craftsmen with whom he was lodging, Swed-berg’s time was devoted to astronomical problems; and he was espe-cially absorbed by one question which, if he could have found theanswer, would have brought him fame and fortune—how to deter-mine longitude with the help of the moon, an assignment announcedby the Royal Society. The purpose was to make navigation at sea safer.The young Swede, however, like so many others, was unable to solvethe problem. It seems that his disappointment was so bitter that it be- came a kind of trauma: he returned to the problem on several occa- sions, even as an aged visionary in a paper sent to the Academy ofSciences in Stockholm; unfortunately, it met with as little success ashad all the previous ones. After about three years in England, Emanuel Swedberg moved to Holland, where he received his first impression of the scholarly envi-ronment that had meant so much to Swedish culture and learning inearlier days and still continued to do so.

His last letters from abroad were posted inthe German Baltic provinces of Sweden, which were in the process ofbeing lost in the final stage of the Great Northern War. These letters re-veal that the war was beginning to be a reality to the traveler, althoughhis dominant interests remained scientific and technological. In gen-eral, national tragedies occupied a surprisingly small place in this cor-respondence, even that part written at the headquarters of Charles XII,where Emanuel Swedberg served on several occasions. Meanwhile, his scientific work could be justified militarily to the extent that some of his many projects would have radically increasedhis country’s strength. The designs he brought back from abroad in-cluded sketches of submarines and airplanes, and history would nodoubt have been changed had they been realized. They were items ina long series of more or less fantastic plans, a list that not seldom re-calls contemporary satires on the technological planners known asvirtuosos. But the planner himself had a live example close at hand, a man whom even before his voyage he had looked up to as an ideal:Christopher Polhem (1661–1751), self-taught mechanic and inven-tor, had himself spent several years on the continent and in Englandin the 1690s in order to learn the latest developments in the practicalapplication of mechanics, and had made important contributionsafter his return, for example, in mining technology and the art ofwarfare. It is quite clear that while abroad Swedberg regarded himself as following in Polhem’s footsteps, and the superficial contact he had hadwith his ideal before his voyage was revived after his return in 1715through the intermediary of Benzelius. He wrote a treatise on some ofPolhem’s inventions, which was later published in Daedalus Hyper- boreus, which Swedenborg edited and which was Sweden’s first scien- tific journal, the first of six issues of which was printed in 1716.Polhem obviously had a high opinion of his editor’s mathematicalknowledge and mechanical talent, and the periodical was filled almost entirely with descriptions of Polhem’s inventions.

Daedalus Hyperboreus caused Swedenborg much trouble and some financial worry, but when the periodical came to the attention ofCharles XII at his headquarters in Lund, it opened the door to his ap-pointment as assessor extra ordinem at the Royal Board of Mines, with a special assignment as assistant to Polhem. Despite considerable op-position, Swedenborg was given tenure as assessor some years after thedeath of the autocratic king and remained in the position until 1747,when he resigned in order to devote all his energies to his research inspiritual subjects. Swedenborg’s relationship to Polhem was not wholly without fric- tion, and it appears from Polhem’s letters as if he was occasionallysomewhat suspicious of the learned “young Mr. Swedberg” and attimes displeased with inexact reviews and descriptions in the periodi-cal. But his mildly paranoid attitude scarcely went much below thesurface, and it is probable that Polhem would happily have acceptedhis assistant as a son-in-law if his daughter Emerentia had been will-ing. That Polhem was of great importance to Swedenborg’s scientificdevelopment is beyond all doubt. When Swedenborg strove to includeever greater domains, including psychical, within a mechanistic philos-ophy, he had many forerunners among natural scientists of the Carte-sian tradition in its broadest sense, but Polhem was the scholar towhom he was closest during several years of great significance to hisdevelopment. In addition to Daedalus Hyperboreus, Swedenborg published a se- ries of short papers during the 1710s and the beginning of the 1720s,mathematical, geological, and cosmological treatises, but also a collec- tion of poems in Latin. His activities subsided in the new political sit- uation after the death of Charles XII in 1718, and Swedenborg complained bitterly of the lack of understanding of the importance ofresearch shown during these early days of the rule of the Estates.

Until 1734 Swedenborg’s writing was almost en- tirely confined to questions relating to his position at the Board of Mines, including the first technological assessment undertaken in Swe-den (of a Newcomen steam engine), and to contemporary political andeconomical problems. 5 In 1729 when he was elected a member of Societas Literaria et Sci- entiarumin Uppsala, an offshoot of the Collegium Curiosorum of the 1710s, Swedenborg explained his silence in letters by the circumstancethat in the space of ten years he had “assembled all the facts which con-tribute to knowledge in Metallicis et regno minerali.” 6A few years later, the results of these efforts were incorporated in the three great folios,Opera Philosophica et Mineralia, with which the 46-year-old EmanuelSwedenborg appeared before the learned readers of Europe and whichsoon gained him a great reputation as a mineralogist. In a letter toBenzelius, written in 1736, the famous German orientalist ChristopherWolf called his brother-in-law a vir optimus et sagax with few contem- porary equals in natural history. 7 It is difficult to define the general impressions conveyed by the personal documents and scientific papers mentioned above, mainlybecause they are so unsensational. We find a man with an alert andagile intellect and an insatiable appetite for all the fare offered by mod-ern science, who through fortunate circumstances found himself in thecenters of European research during the period when a scientist ac-quires his methodological principles. The mathematical language that Galileo regarded as essential for the reading of the book of nature wasat its most advanced stage in the England of Newton. Swedenborg early understood the decisive importance of mathematics to modernresearch and tried both to learn and to disseminate the latest findings.It has been said that he actually had no great mathematical gift, butthat his knowledge after his return from abroad was vastly superior tothat of his compatriots. There is no question that he retained hisyouthful enthusiasm for the abstract beauty of the world of mathemat-ics even into his theosophical period, as will be shown in greater detaillater on.V i s i o n a r y S c i e n t i s t 14"

The traveler was extremely eager to point out how clever and diligent he was, and his many moreor less impracticable research projects fit into the same pattern. But itwould be unfair to over-emphasize this element and to interpret it as asymptom of instability. Instead it reveals a normal lack of confidence,as well as high aspirations. The letters reflect very little of Jesper Swed-berg’s boundless self-confidence and nothing of the father’s naive be-lief in miracles, but in general they make a sober impression: the levelof egocentricity scarcely exceeds what can be considered normal in ayoung scholar. The young Swedenborg was thus neither a bookworm without contact with reality nor a marked careerist. What is most striking—and in many ways impressive—is his appetite for knowledge in somany areas and his willingness to share what he learned. It is impor-tant to emphasize the practical streak in Swedenborg, since it is easy tothink of him as a mild dreamer, a converser with angels even as ayoung man. The heritage from generations of mining men predis-posed him for the tasks he was given as Polhem’s assistant and assessorat the Board of Mines, and even as an old man in his theosophical pe-riod, he continued to be concerned with political and financial prob-lems and with finding solutions for them. In addition, Swedenborgwas one of the most widely traveled Swedes of the eighteenth century,even though he never left Europe. Extant diaries from some of his voyages yield further information about the man Swedenborg. The more detailed of them cover the years1733–1734 and 1736–1739, the first in Latin, the second, strangelyenough, in Swedish (Swedenborg usually wrote even outlines and pri- vate notes in Latin). In Swedish literature, Carl von Linné’s descrip- tions of his travels became classics through their spontaneous charm,ability to capture swift impressions and moods, pure epical joy, andnaive observations; but Swedenborg, an older relative of Linné, neverachieved the same heights with his accounts of his travels.

There is nothing in these diaries to suggest that they were written by a man who within a few years would be initiated into mysticism. Onthe contrary, one is struck by the worldliness of Swedenborg’s life as atourist in Paris during the fall of 1736. He went to the theater repeat-edly and made careful notes of the names of the actors and dancers:one might ask oneself to what end. On the other hand, he scarcelymentions things that would interest today’s reader: the purpose of hislong stay in Paris (1736–1738), the people he met, the books he read,etc. Obviously some of this is revealed in other ways, particularlythrough the tremendous number of excerpts, which were either left inthe manuscripts or directly used in the great biological works resultingfrom the 1736–1739 voyage and the new expedition beginning in 1743;nonetheless, one would gladly have exchanged the names of Parisianhistrions for precise information about his learned work. A journal from the 1743 voyage is still extant, and there is no doubt that it was originally planned to include the same kinds of dataas the two earlier ones. However, the notes only relate facts about theroute from Stockholm to Groningen and Leeuwarden in Holland viaHamburg before they are broken off abruptly. Thereafter we depart al-most completely from the normal world of the senses and are givenshocking insights into the mundus subterraneus of a dream world. The notes from the years 1743–1744, which were written in a rather crude but expressive Swedish, are usually called the Journal of Dreams and constitute one of the most widely known and most frequently quoted Swedenborgian documents; they were discovered and pub- lished in 1859 and immediately caused a sensation, even something ofa scandal. 9 Obviously, Swedenborg never intended his diary for publication, but it gives us an exceptional opportunity to see Swedenborg, the man,V i s i o n a r y S c i e n t i s t 16"

Although the same is true of the earlier travel journals, this one is especially interesting since it permits us tofollow Swedenborg’s religious crisis during its most agitated stage. Weshall study this document in greater detail later on. An entry dated Oc-tober 18, 1744, illustrates how the dreamer suffered under the burdenof his ambition and self-love and how he interpreted his dreams in thelight of his sense of guilt: How a big dog, which I thought was fastened, flew at me and bit me in the leg; someone came and held its terrible jaws so that it could dono more mischief.

The Journal of Dreams was written during the years when Sweden- borg was struggling to realize his gigantic plans for an exhaustive de-scription of man, which was to be called Regnum Animale , or the Animal Kingdom (in the sense of “the realm of the soul,” i.e., thehuman body). The outline and several lists of titles show that the workwould have comprised seventeen volumes and that it would carry outthe tremendous assignment he had formulated in his short treatise onthe problem of the infinite in 1734: ut ipsis sensibus animae immortali- tas demonstretur, that the immortality of the soul may be proven to the senses themselves, i.e., empirically. 11The work on this truly heroic task is reflected both directly and indirectly in the Journal of Dreams. One of the reasons Swedenborg’s notes on dreams caused such a furor when they appeared in the middle of the nineteenth century was that they contained frank descriptions of sexual fantasies. These were aproblem for many high-minded reviewers who went to great length toexplain them away. But Swedenborg was not a product of the prudishVictorian era and therefore did not regard sexuality as the foremost work of the devil.

We must rememberthat Swedenborg lived in an age that was characterized by a remark-ably frivolous attitude to erotic matters; not even the most hard-working scholar could avoid seeing examples of this in the Paris of the1730s, and certainly not a frequent visitor to the theater as Sweden-borg. This is a general premise, but more specific factors were theanatomical studies of human procreation being carried on at the sametime. When a lonely bachelor in his early middle age is working on aninvestigation of the smallest details of the sexual organs, endeavoringto fit them into his comprehensive vision of the human microcosm, itis scarcely surprising that his speculations continue in more palpableform in his dreams. The Journal of Dreams is evidence of the psychical turbulence of the transitional period. The dreamer found peace in April 1745 whenhe experienced his illumination, a vision that commanded him to puthis scientific work aside and devote himself instead to interpreting theScriptures. With this transition, we find a new firmness in the descrip-tions of the visions as compared with the notes on dreams. At the sametime, the Journal of Dreams clearly prophesied what was to come, not least in the interpretation of the sexual dreams. Swedenborg’s explana-tions of the tempting—or repulsive—female figures are almostFreudian in reverse: he identifies them with various abstract concepts,the sciences, philosophy, etc. This strange combination of vividly concrete visions and dryly ab- stract interpretations is characteristic of Swedenborg’s theosophicalwritings. For scholars who are not among Swedenborg’s followers, reading his vast exegetic texts can be trying. The vigorous and colorfulepic of the Pentateuch and the Apocalypse is translated into a meta-physical and theological code that seems light-years remote from theoriginal. The memorabilia of the spiritual world, which he intersperses among the hermeneutic chapters, appear to the reader as oases in adesert. This interchapter material originates mainly in the notes made from October 1747 to the middle of the 1760s in the so-called spiritual diary, Diarium Spirituale . 12As his exegesis grew more assured andV i s i o n a r y S c i e n t i s t 18"

This applies not least to people who had been close to him or oth- erwise influenced his development: to Erik Benzelius who is picturedas the worst of infernal spirits, to Polhem and Charles XII—the latter,one of history’s typical bachelors, was doomed to the ludicrous fate ofa henpecked husband—and to a series of relatives. The comments onBenzelius are the hardest to understand, even if he, as archbishop ofSweden, represented Lutheran orthodoxy, which the visionary de-tested. To the modern observer, the bitterness of his reactions seemsincomprehensible, even pathological. At the same time, the fact thatSwedenborg so precisely and so calmly relegated the ideal and benefac-tor of his youth to the lowest regions of hell may derive from his pro-found innocence, his passion for consistency, and the emotionalaridity of the intellectual. Swedenborg’s hell was intended to illustratethe same belief as Dante’s Inferno, that God is love. Judging by comments of his contemporaries, it was easier to be aware of that belief in personal encounters with the visionary. When inSweden, Swedenborg lived very simply in his house in the southernpart of Stockholm, but he indulged in various exotic plants and otherattractions in his garden to amuse children and other visitors. Hiswork on the Scriptures kept him constantly occupied, but his workinghours were rather irregular and allowed him to go into society. This heenjoyed, and he always tried to behave like a correct elderly gentleman:that he did not always succeed depended on his being almost the pro-totype of the absent-minded professor. He conversed in a quiet anderudite fashion, but stammered badly when excited. Since he willinglyspoke of his unique spiritual experiences, Swedenborg was in great de-mand in society, and many people also sought his advice on practical questions which only spirits could answer. His fame spread all over Europe from the late 1750s; indeed, the cultural climate of the latter half of the eighteenth century was inmany respects favorable to mysticism and magic.

It was then that he had the decisivespiritual experience that drew him away from his scientific studies tohis work as an interpreter of Holy Writ. But his illumination did notlead to a denial of his earlier contributions or a rejection of their re-sults. On the contrary, it is essential to keep in mind the fact, as em-phasized by Emerson and others, that Swedenborg integrated hisscientific thinking and experience with his newly acquired religiousconviction, and this means that those who want to understand thefundamentals of his system should devote greater attention to his ac-tivities as a scientist than to his theosophical period. From the outset, Swedenborg was interested in a whole series of scientific disciplines, but there is, nevertheless, reason to begin with his speculations concerning physical questions in the broad sense up to and including his Opera Philosophica et Mineralia (Philosophical and Mineralogical Works, 1734), which mark both the culmination and the end. We shall then turn to his contributions in the fields of anatomyand physiology. His entire scientific ambition after 1734 was con - centrated on grasping the essence of the soul—as already said, the"

A tripartite disposition thus appears to be best suitedto the material, though we must remember that sharp lines cannot bedrawn between the areas of research, especially in the case of a manwith such a burning and early evidenced desire for synthesis asEmanuel Swedenborg. Cosmological Problems England was the natural goal for a young student with an “immoderatedesire” for mathematics, as Swedenborg described himself in one of hisfirst letters from that country. This passion could not be satisfied inUppsala, as was eloquently revealed by the observation made by PetrusElvius, professor of astronomy, to his former pupil in London in 1711:“What the learned mathematicians think of principia motuum plane- tarum Newtonii, since they appear to be pure abstractions and nothingphysical, namely, how one corpus planetarum shall exert gravity on an- other, etc., which appears unreasonable.” 13 But his stay in England did not convert Swedenborg into a disciple of Newton, despite his enthusiastic expectations. He was never able toaccept Newton’s theory of empty space, nor did he sympathize with the new demands for scientific self-restraint that lay behind the procla- mation hypotheses non fingo. Newton makes his statement in the Gen- eral Scholiumat the end of the Principia mathematica when discussing the cause of gravity, which he had not been able to discover from phe-nomena: “And I frame no hypotheses; for whatever is not deduced from the phenomena is to be called an hypothesis; and hypotheses,whether metaphysical or physical, whether of occult qualities or me-chanical, have no place in experimental philosophy.” 14To Swedenborg, the description of a process and the formulation of its law, no matterhow exact, were completely inadequate.

Three decades later, thissearch was to lead him across the boundary lines of the senses—and ofscience as well. The Cartesian philosophy that Swedenborg had adopted in Upp- sala was thus not disturbed in any decisive sense during his foreigntravels, and essential parts of it remained with him throughout his life.It is not particularly apparent in his early production, however, sincehe never completed the program formulated in the preface to a paperon the changes in the earth’s orbit (1718): One should begin with a Theoria Telluris, or a treatise on the first origin of the planets, on their separation from their chaos and on their course and resistance in their air: it would also be necessary tocompare Cartesii, Newtonii and others’ views, so that the reader him- self could judge which best follows reason and geometry, but sincethis would be too far-reaching, it requires its own treatise. 15 After preliminary attempts to define his standpoint in Latin papers at the beginning of the 1720s, Swedenborg presented this treatise in the first volume of his Philosophical and Mineralogical Works (1734), called Principia rerum naturalium (The Principles of Natural Things). However, it is typical of his general philosophy that, in the tract of1718, after having apostrophized the pioneers of the new science, heopened his presentation with a survey of the belief in paradise and thegolden age expressed in the Bible and in classical poetry and philoso-phy, according to which there was eternal spring in the beginning of tellurian time: Homer (the true ancestor of the poets) made so much of the same time that he likened it to a heaven, placed all gods and goddessesthere, made homes for Floram, Pan, Pomonam, assumed that Pallas,Venus, and all other deities of pleasure had their resort and theirmeetings with mortals there, so that gods and their sons lived to- gether with humans; which means that the earth likened a heavenand the age an era of celestial delight. 16Swedenborg’s Philosophy of Nature 23"

In Arcana Coelestia(Heavenly Secrets, 1749–1756), the story of Adam in paradise is interpreted as referring to the oldest society in which humans un-derstood intuitively the innermost essence of things and every materialobject bore witness to spiritual truths and were living symbols of thedivine. It is true that we can find a good many critical statements about Uppsala’s dogmatic Cartesians in the works of Swedenborg’s youth,but they should not be overestimated. These criticisms express thecondescending attitude of the scientist active outside the university to-ward the academic teachers, an attitude that was common in the daysof the Enlightenment and the learned societies. Swedenborg embracedhis mentor Polhem’s views as they were formulated in a letter in 1716: In summa, if the learned want to have pleasure and honor from what they teach others they should have better knowledge of much ofwhat is now taught, for Nature in many respects has qualities totallydifferent from what Cartesiusand almost all his followers mean, which can never be better proved than by a daily experience of me-chanics and a penetrating analysis of the causes. 17 Swedenborg also adopted this combination of empiricism and ra- tional analysis as his research program, but like Polhem he did not stray very far from Descartes. They both adhered to Cartesian viewsconcerning empty space and light, and they also retained his corpuscu-lar model for the structure of matter. When Swedenborg presented hisversion in Principia rerum naturalium, it might seem hopelessly out- of-date almost half a century after Principia mathematica, but it should be recalled that Alexander Pope’s planned epitaph for Sir Isaac needs tobe complemented on one important point: Nature and Nature’s laws lay hid in night God said, Let Newton be! and all was light.V i s i o n a r y S c i e n t i s t 24"

Even though Principia mathematica was in Swedenborg’s library, he remained faithful to Descartes and took the three main themes ofhis philosophy of nature from the French rationalist’s Principia philosophiae(Principles of Philosophy): (1) that matter consists of par- ticles that are indefinitely divisible, (2) that these particles are in con-stant vortical motion, and (3) that the earth and the planets sprangfrom the solar mass. In the world of material substances, of extension,Descartes distinguished no forces other than mechanical; externalform and motion are the only concepts needed to describe it. Matter isentirely uniform and consists of an indefinite number of divisible par-ticles, which group themselves in species forming the three elements:fire, ether, and earth. Empty space does not exist, but the extension ofspace is governed by the same laws as bodies and thus presupposes theexistence of material particles. Swedenborg admittedly tried to go further than Descartes regard- ing the divisibility of the particles; but when he was forced to conceiveconcretely of a limit to this divisibility, he did not arrive at any atomictheory but at a no-man’s-land between matter and spirit, namely, atthe mathematical point which is an abstract construction. This meantthat the series of particles led Swedenborg into the world of mathe-matics, but not, in his opinion, across the border to the Infinite—forthere our worldly geometry and algebra are not applicable. During his scientific period, Swedenborg was concerned with keeping this bound-ary clear-cut, and he frequently accused others of making impermissi-ble analogical leaps across it, as we shall see later on. In the Cartesian universe, motion within the material continuum can only be produced through the particles having different shapesand sizes. This thesis can best be illustrated by Descartes’s theory of the origin of the earth. He believed that it had originated in the fire of thesun and that the birth process had corresponded to the formation of sunspots, namely, that coarser particles found their way to the Swedenborg’s Philosophy of Nature 25"

In severe cases, a sun could be entirely eclipsed by this foam of particles, whereupon it could no longer remain separate from the sur-rounding element (the ether), but would be sucked into stronger vor-tices in the neighborhood. In this way our earth would have beendrawn into the enormous vortex of the solar system, in whose rotationit follows. The result is thus a kind of heliocentric theory with reserva-tions, in which the earth actually is at rest and only follows along in thesolar vortex. This brings us to the domain in which Swedenborg made his most renowned contributions as a natural scientist, namely, the planetarytheory. Among other things, he modified the Cartesian hypothesis byhaving the earth and the planets emanate from the mass of the sun it-self, from which they had been ejected rather than sucked in towardthe center of the sun. He thereby greatly simplified the hypothesis, andhis theory can be regarded as a precursor of the Kant–Laplace nebulartheory. The question has even been raised whether Swedenborg doesnot reserve credit for this renowned theory, and it has been suggestedthat Buffon’s Histoire Naturelle was the connecting link; there was a copy of Swedenborg’s Principia rerum naturalium in Buffon’s library. 18 There is no established connection, however, and it may have been a matter either of a relatively obvious modification of the generallyknown Cartesian hypothesis or of another text read by both men.Swedenborg did not refer in Principia either to Descartes or to Newton but rather to classical poetry and thought, including Ovid’s repeatedlyquoted description of chaos in the first lines of Metamorphoses. The words in Genesis about the deep over which the spirit of God moved in the beginning were also related to Ovid’s chaos—rudis indigestaquemoles,formless and confused mass. Furthermore, Swedenborg revived the concept of the great world egg formulated in various cosmogonies.This symbol, which to a man versed in biology offered a unique op-portunity to tie together microcosm and macrocosm, inanimate and animate nature, recurs with great poetic effect in the early drama ofthe creation, De Cultu et Amore Dei (The Worship and Love of God, 1745), which marked the end of Swedenborg’s career as a natural scientist.V i s i o n a r y S c i e n t i s t 26"

Thiswas Thomas Burnet’s Telluris Theoria Sacra (A Sacred Theory of the Earth), first published as early as 1681 but still the subject of heateddiscussion among the scholars Swedenborg met. Although the work iswidely known, it has not been observed by Swedenborg scholars, pre-sumably due to a misunderstanding in Tafel’s great collection of docu-ments. In his survey of the manuscripts, Tafel reported that Codex 86contained quotations on cosmology, etc., from an author calledRoumette. 19But the Latin rubric in the manuscript reads “ex Bour- netto” (from Burnet), and under it we find the classical and biblicalsources quoted in Principia(as usual without mentioning the primary source), together with notes on Burnet’s method of utilizing the classi-cal myth of the world egg. Swedenborg’s only direct reference to Bur-net was brief, polemical, and early—1718—and gave no indication ofthe scope of his influence. 20 Burnet’s influence should probably be regarded as a decisive stim- ulus for Swedenborg’s cosmology, even though he greatly expandedBurnet’s perspective. Telluris Theoria Sacra, as the title indicates, is a hypothesis of the origin of the earth, while Swedenborg’s aim, as al-ready stated, was to explain the origin of the entire planetary system.According to Burnet, God created chaos, which admittedly was acrude, incohesive mass, but nevertheless contained the laws for the de-velopment of cosmos; and in it the elementary particles were graduallyseparated into different layers. The heavier ones sank toward the cen-ter, the lighter ones rose to the surface, and the very lightest formed theair. Together with dust particles in the air, the oily outer layer of thewater particles in chaos formed the crust of the earth that at first wassmooth and uniform. The later changes in the surface of the earth, ac- cording to Burnet, were caused by the Deluge, which shattered thecrust. In general, Swedenborg agreed with Burnet, even though he hada different opinion of the actual technical workings of the Flood.

This is precisely what occurred according to Swedenborg’s plane- tary theory, and he thus made the planets the children of the sun,which unquestionably is close to Burnet’s view. Now, Buffon was agreat admirer of Burnet and analyzed his theory in Histoire Naturelle, which may explain the similarities between the Kant–Laplace nebularhypothesis and Swedenborg’s theory. The many references to classicalspeculations in Swedenborg’s cosmological contexts caused certainscholars to regard direct impulses from antiquity as decisive. An exam-ple of this is the assumption by Alfred Stroh, the respected AmericanSwedenborgian scholar, that Ovid’s description of chaos was his prin-cipal source. 21However, a comparison between Telluris Theoria Sacra and Principia rerum naturalium clearly shows that Burnet’s work holds that position. This applies both generally and in detail, and it is not unlikely that an even more profound influence than the purely cosmological shouldbe recognized. Coleridge once planned to transform Burnet’s workinto an epic poem, and he refers to it in his Biographia Literaria as proof that the noblest kinds of poetry need not have the outer form ofa poem. 22This poetic charm, noted by Coleridge, probably resulted from the author’s view of poetry and myths as media of an esoteric wisdom, in this case from an age before both fables and written his-tory, to use the somewhat schematic differentiation of the day. In anycase, one can state hypothetically that Swedenborg’s warm apprecia-tion of the cognitive value of the myths of the golden age and classicalpoetry is related to his reading of Burnet as a young man, and it isnoteworthy that he himself experimented with a poetic “mythical”form when he tried to summarize his knowledge in the natural sci- ences in the unfortunately—but maybe inevitably—unfinished De Cultu et Amore Dei.V i s i o n a r y S c i e n t i s t 28"

Thus they lay scattered like suckling masses near the burningbosom of their father, and, as it were, at his teats. But presentlywhen the sun, the folding-doors being unlocked and the gatesthrown open to the empty universe, had begun to cast forth fieryexhalations from his now full and swelling mouth, and to distend itwith his powers and forces, he first filled the neighboring andpresently the more remote distances with auras and thus withspaces. Hence arose ether, which being diffused around the sun, andat the same time also around the masses which encompass him,wrapped the latter, as it were, in swathings or spires, and encom-passed them with spheres suited to the mobility of each. In the cir-cumferences of their spheres he placed a pole, which he drew intoperpetual orbs, and from them produced a central gyration, inwhich the mass was involved. Hence it came to pass that those bod-ies, being as yet fluids, and as it were molten, assumed an orbicularform from the concourse of so many centripetal forces. These nowbecame orbs, and of no weight, as it were, because in centres, andbeing conveyed and put in rotation by the surrounding ether, theyfirst began to creep and then to walk around the sun, and presently,like little children, to dance and leap, and by quick and short circuitsto make a commencement of years, and a rotation of days, and thusto enter upon their periods. 23 The Mathematical Point, Particles, and Elements Even though Swedenborg never gave the same grand framework to his speculations on the beginning of the particle series as to its comple-tion, when Earth and the other planets were born, they called for atleast as great imaginative powers.

All geomet- ric figures could be restored to that point, if only motion existed, andthe Creator himself introduced motion into the universe. At the outset, this point obviously only served as an auxiliary con- cept, and Swedenborg soon left it behind him. However, he dwelt on itat greater length in the Principia. The Creator had introduced in the point a conatusto motion—the scholastic notion can be rendered as “striving,” and Swedenborg probably borrowed it from the great uni-versity philosopher of the day, Christian Wolff, a disciple of Leibniz,with whose metaphysics he had become acquainted just before thefinal editing of Principiain 1733—but it could not be described in geometrical terms. This lack of mathematical proof sorely triedSwedenborg, and he expressed a hope that others would find a moreadequate means of making it intelligible. Until someone did, he had tobe content with images and symbols that at times gave admirable re-sults. Characteristically, he once more returned to classical mythology.This time it is the Roman god Janus with his two faces who illustratesthe ability of the mathematical point to look at two worlds simultane-ously, at the infinite and at the physical universe. Janus was the god ofthe archway and of the door, and this is the function from whichSwedenborg proceeded when he described the purpose of the mathe-matical point in the following passage: By this point, as by a door, we are introduced into the world; and ad- mitted into a kind of geometrical field, where ample scope is af-forded for the exercise of the human understanding. As soon as,through the medium of this point, an entrance is found, into thefinited universe or the world, man instantly begins to have a knowl- edge of himself, to perceive that he is something, that he is finited,V i s i o n a r y S c i e n t i s t 30"

Wherefore the worldis incipient at this point, and with the world nature itself; or, whatamounts to the same, nature has its incipience by it, and the worldwith nature. On these grounds and considerations, our point may besaid to be the medium between what is infinite and what is finite. 24 This visually understandable description, which in its ability to give concrete life to an utter abstraction—and in its verbosity as well— is so typical of Swedenborg, is still grounded in the thought of a nat-ural scientist of the Cartesian denomination. That which existed at theother exit of Janus’ archway, the infinite, still lacked definition, but themethodological discussion in the introductory chapter of Principiare- veals how a melancholy Swedenborg imagined that the first human be-ings would have intuitively experienced the infinite. Nature in itself isnothing, did not create itself, but is only a product of the infinite viathe point and motion. In the age of innocence, when there was com-plete harmony between the physical senses and the soul, human beingswere constantly aware that nature is but an image of eternity; but thisharmony was destroyed by the fall of man, channels of knowledge werebroken, and the order of the universe was disrupted. Now we couldonly guess at the truth, and our obscure thoughts could only be ex-pressed in analogies and images. At the same time, Swedenborg had no reservations about devising an extremely detailed series of hypothetical particles and elements be- tween the mathematical point and the material bodies about which we learn from our senses. However, in this entire vast exposition only twoprinciples are active in constant repetition and variation, namely, the point and the force introduced into it. As behooved a disciple ofDescartes, he interpreted this force as the most perfect form of motion,the spiral.

It was passive in itself, nature’s cornerstone, but it had the ability to emit a free force called activum primi. From this force was created the second substance, which formed the first elementof nature. It in turn released a free force, activum secundi, and together these forces formed the solar ocean. The next stage was the third sub-stance and the second element, the magnetic. And so the process con-tinued up to the terrestrial bodies and the organisms, or possibly evenfurther. It is thus the natural point that is multiplied to ever greater powers in this all-inclusive series. The elements were assumed to be made upof a kind of bubbles (bullula), whose surface consisted of the next higher finite, while the interior was filled with the preceding activato- gether with the activumof the stage itself. The surface of the magnetic element was thus formed by the third finite and its interior by activa primi et secundi. In this way, each bullulumbecame a reflection of the entire universe. Even the most concentrated description of thisgrandiose system must convey the impression of a great imaginativegift, especially sensitive to uniform models, analogies, correspon-dences. Obviously a vision of such compelling force includes a ten-dency to cross boundaries, to appropriate increasingly vast domains.In Principia, however, Swedenborg merely gave a hint that the series might have a continuation. Perhaps higher orders of activaexist that our senses cannot apprehend. What he is referring to must surely beangels and spirits, in whose existence he shared the vague belief of his contemporaries. Not many years were to pass before these spiritualsubstances became the visionary’s subjects of research and his dailycompanions.

He presents a clearlydisposed and stringently executed argumentation, which begins by dis-cussing evidence that the infinite actually exists. Then, after acknowl-edging the physico-theological proof of the existence of God, he givesa critical survey of a series of different beliefs in God and philosophicalattempts to define the notion of the infinite. The principal objectionhere is that, by endeavoring to treat the infinite with the usual methodsof finite thought, one lands in pantheism or in nature worship. Theone who best survived this philosophers’ ordeal was Aristotle. Thismay seem strange in a thinker who otherwise adhered so closely toDescartes, the arch-enemy of Aristotelianism, but it illustrates a changein the intellectual climate, which there will be reason to discuss later. Finally, all philosophical arguments proved inadequate and Swedenborg was compelled to take refuge in Revelation. The ardentlydesired link (nexus)between the infinite and the finite was the Son of God who, together with the Father and yet separate from him, createdthe universe. No reference is made to any particular part of the Bible,but he must have had in mind the preamble to the Gospel of John, themost philosophical of the Gospels; the divine Logosis hinted at as the first link in the series of nature. For this alone, De Infinitorepresents one of Swedenborg’s most significant approaches to the spiritual worldduring the first part of his life. Before he could proceed, however, vast research problems re- mained to be solved. Significantly enough, the tract on the infinite waspublished together with a paper on the interaction between soul andbody. After 1734, Swedenborg turned against organic nature, in the lastresort towards man. This meant a shift from the origin of the series ofparticles to its final point and objective, from the birth of the planetarysystem to that of the organisms, from oscillating light and sound to vi- brating nerve fibers—a tremendous widening of perspectives in which the already structured model nevertheless remained intact.Swedenborg’s Philosophy of Nature 33"

Descartes in-cluded in matter the biological organisms, all of which possess the at-tribute of extension. It is therefore consistent that Cartesian biologycame to be marked by a mechanistic point of view and that it treatedthe organisms as natural phenomena, which did not differ in principlefrom inanimate objects; and it is equally logical that the Cartesian pre-sentations of the philosophy of nature were generally concluded withbiological and anatomical passages. The master himself in Traité de l’homme(Treatise on Man) applied his mechanistic physics to human physiology and to a certain degree to human psychology also. As a basis, Descartes used the results of the anatomical research initiated through Andreas Vesalius’ De fabrica corporis humani (On the Structure of the Human Body), published the same year as Coperni-cus’ macroscopic masterpiece De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres), 1543, and which, in Descartes’s lifetime, had as brilliant a representative as William Harvey.When Harvey unassumingly published the renowned Exercitatio de"

The growth, triumph, decline, and fall of mechanistic biology can be traced over the period 1670–1745. 25Descartes’s system began to gain general acceptance around 1670, and by the turn of the century,mechanistic biology had become irrefutable dogma for most Frenchscholars. In this area, as in many others, France set the pace for thelearned world of Europe. This view of the structure of the organismsobviously favored anatomy as a science. The mechanism of life couldbe determined only with the help of the concepts of motion and form.Hence, it was essential to determine the pattern of motion and geo-metrical figuration of the organism; the anatomists did their best todetect “machines” in the human body resembling those that could bemade from inanimate matter. This mechanistic dogma was one important stimulation for the development of biology, the endeavor to build on observation and ex-perimentation being another one. Microbiology became increasinglysignificant in the second half of the seventeenth century as a result ofthe work of a number of microscopists headed by the self-taughtDutchman Leeuwenhoek. With the help of ground lenses, fantasticviews of a hitherto unknown world were opened, and it is understand-able that many were intoxicated by the sight of the incalculable richesof nature and tried to find analogies and correspondences everywhere. During the latter part of the period, however, this empiric ambition began to lead to new theories replacing the mechanistic dogmas, atleast the purely Cartesian. The principal stumbling block of these the-ses was always the same: the explanation of the origin of new organ-isms. The laws of motion and the geometrical patterns introduced into matter proved untenable as explanations of the genesis of highly com-plicated organisms. Three main theories concerning the origin of organisms were dominant during the years 1670–1745. The first was “ovism,” the V i s i o n a r y S c i e n t i s t 36"

In 1677, he discovered spermatozoa, whichhe looked upon as a kind of tiny animals, animalcula. To begin with, however, he did not grasp their significance in regard to fertilization,but confined himself to attacking the current belief on one point, towit, the belief that the fetus is not developed in the egg before itleaves the ovary and that the sperm is merely a transmitter of the fer-tilizing spirit (aura seminalis). Instead, he believed that the fetus is pre-formed in the thicker parts of the seminal fluid and thereby im-planted in the uterus. This brought him into conflict with the ovisttheory; and, in heated debate with its proponents including membersof the Royal Society in London, he presented in 1683 an animalculisttheory, according to which the spermatozoa are pre-formed fetusesthat attach themselves to the uterus. As soon as a single one of thegreat mass has found a hold, which can only be done in two or threeplaces, it repulses all the others and immediately begins its longprocess of transformation. Leeuwenhoek’s theory was disseminated by the learned journals, which at that time began to play an important role as media for thediscoveries of the new sciences, such as Le Clerc’s Bibliothèque uni- verselle et historique, Journal des Savants, and the rest; but it was se- verely criticized on several points. Many doubted that these animalcula existed. The idea that the fetus was pre-formed in the egg was a hurdle,and it was difficult to grasp that such masses of spermatozoa were re-quired when only one would survive. This objection was of theological significance, since the theory seemed to imply that God would unnec- essarily create an infinite number of diminutive beings who wouldnever achieve independent life. Leeuwenhoek himself believed that thespermatozoa were formed in the testicles and that they constituted aspecial genus of animal—in French, his theory was called the vermist or worm theory—and that they thus were not infinitely tiny beings butonly bore such within themselves.

At about the same time, the interests of the anatomists were di- verted in other directions. However, the third generation theory, whichdeveloped from their discoveries, survived—namely, the notion thatthe seeds and eggs contain infinitely tiny individuals who merely growin size during the fetal period. This theory dated back to another greatDutch scholar, Jan Swammerdam (1637–1680), who formulated it inhis work Historia insectorum generalis (General History of Insects, 1669) and, with his religiously mystical temperament, drew several im-portant theological conclusions from it. The pre-existent human seedwas present in the egg, and all human eggs had existed in the ovaries ofEve, the mother of humankind. This also meant that the human racewould die out once the finite number of eggs had been exhausted, andthat Eve’s fall affected all her progeny in a biologically concrete sense,which provides an extremely tangible explanation of the concept oforiginal sin. The theory was based on microscopic observations, including those made by Marcello Malpighi (1628–1694), the scientist so fre-quently quoted by Swedenborg. It spread rapidly and was widely ac-cepted through the philosopher Malebranche, who included it as earlyas 1674 in his famous work Recherche de la vérité (Search for Truth), which also strongly influenced Swedenborg; the pursuit for truth wasstarted by the famous Oratorian father from Cartesian premises, whichwas not least important to Descartes’s disciple Swedenborg. The pre-formation theory exactly suited Malebranche in the sense that it de- prived nature of all independent activity. Only such things developedin nature as were implanted in it by the Creator before the beginningof time and in utter subservience to the immutable law of order. It fur-ther meant that the mechanical principles present in the world did notexplain its creation. The world, inanimate as well as animate, could nothave come into being from mechanical causes but presupposed a Cre-ator, who admittedly allowed all to take place according to the laws ofmechanics and geometry but who gave this conformity to law a fixed ultimate objective. 26The same teleological view was held by LeibnizV i s i o n a r y S c i e n t i s t 38"

Swedenborg’s Biological Speculations until 1734 It is natural that a versatile spirit with Swedenborg’s Cartesian trainingwould try at an early stage to penetrate the life sciences. Swedenborg’sfirst attempts were to explain the nature of human sensory percep-tions. The initial example was a short paper in the last issue of the pe-riodical Daedalus Hyperboreus (1718), entitled Bewis at wårt lefwande wesende består merendels i små Darringar thet är Tremulationer (Proof that Our Vital Essence Consists Mostly of Small Quiverings, i.e.,Tremors). Here Swedenborg extended his observations on the waves indifferent media to apply to the human body, and we see how heavily heleaned on Polhem’s studies of the nature of sound, which were pub-lished in earlier issues of the periodical. All sensory reports, both external and internal, consist of tremors of the nerve fibers that pass on to what Swedenborg rather vaguelycalls the brain membrane, and from it such “quiverings” in turn spreadto the entire body. He also believed that they could reach beyond theirown organism. He thus assumed the same effect as a vibrating stringon a musical instrument can have on the other strings tuned to thesame key: It often happens that a person joins another’s thought, so that he gets a presentiment of what the other does and thinks, i.e., that his mem-brane quivers because of the other’s quivering, as one string becauseof another’s, because they are tuned to the same pitch. 27 In these terms, the organism most closely resembles a complicated musical instrument with strings, membranes, and soundboard, which should, of course, be borne in mind when trying to evaluate theF r o m I n o r g a n i c t o O r g a n i c N a t u r e 39"

Swedenborg himself declared that this work stemmed from the Italian anatomists Baglivi, Borellus, and Cortesius. The last name hashitherto been misread as “Cartesius,” which is easily understood be-cause of the similarity and because the point of departure of the studywas a Cartesian theory of motion as the cause of life. Swedenborg con-siders tremor to be the most subtle of all the forms of motion in na-ture. There are various degrees of tremor, however, from the coarsestand most distinct as in the lungs, heart, and—characteristic of theanatomy of the day—the brain. Swedenborg distinguishes betweenthree types of tremor: undulation, true tremor, and contremiscens, or sensation. True tremor embraces the range of vibration that gives rise to sound effects, which Swedenborg fixes at approximately 30 to 200 vi-brations per second; as we know, modern measuring methods set theupper limit much higher, approximately 20,000 vibrations per second.The sensations, in his view, are movements of the same type but withsuch high vibratory levels that they cannot be measured or heard. Theessential point, of course, is not the measurability but the fact thatSwedenborg was endeavoring to interpret all sensory functions on the basis of a single mechanical model. The propositions were proved in a manner characteristic of Swedenborg’s entire methodology. He himself described this as “build-ing on an infinite number of experiments, taking advantage of the labor and expenditures of others; namely, working with one’s brain onwhat others have worked with their hands.” 28With the help of the great anatomists of the seventeenth century, particularly RaymondVieussens and Thomas Willis, he first described the nervous systemfrom the medulla oblongata and the medulla spinalis to the further-most extremities and then the various membranes of the body.V i s i o n a r y S c i e n t i s t 40"

This isparticularly applicable to the most advanced and most importantmembranes, the dura mater and pia mater, the hard and the soft cere-bral membranes. Here Swedenborg is uninhibited in his use of theanalogy with musical instruments. The skull, he claims, is porous forthe same reasons that porous woods, like cedar and pine, are bettersuited for use in string instruments than harder woods, in order moreeasily to give resonance to the vibrations of the cerebral membranes. Swedenborg was particularly interested in the lymphatic system, the origin of which he considered to be in the brain. In the same wayas the heart pumps blood, he believed that lymph flows from the brainand circulates via the nerves to the various membranes and from themback to the brain. The vibrations can thus emanate from this flow if itis a question of the brain’s giving orders to the body, or else be trans-mitted to it from the membranes around the lymph vessels in the caseof external influences on the body. This notion is, of course, closely re-lated to the Cartesian hypothesis of the “spirits of life,” spiritus ani- males, as mediating organs between body and soul. Purely locally, Descartes presumed that the exchange of reports and orders takesplace in the pineal gland (glandula pinealis), which was one of the sen-sational discoveries of the new brain anatomy. In his essay of 1719,however, Swedenborg was patently unwilling to accept the conven- tional view of these spirits of life and worked energetically to get awayfrom what he regarded as occult assumptions and to arrive at a thor- oughly mechanistic model. This becomes even clearer when we come to Swedenborg’s next at- tempt to create a new psychophysical theory. It appeared in 1734 and is based on the expanded propositions of the series of elementary parti-cles presented in Principia rerum naturalium the same year.

It proceeded from the daring premise that the soul is a finite entity and thus subject tomechanical laws like the body. This does not mean that the soul can beidentified with any of the subtle particles described in Principia, but in the draft manuscript, Swedenborg draws a parallel between the seriesof particles and the organism’s membranes at lower levels. Not eventhe purest and simplest of these particles is subtle enough, however, toserve as building stones for the soul. Despite this reservation Swedenborg was naturally aware that his mechanistic view of the soul might lead to misunderstandings andconsiderable difficulties, for example, in explaining the highest powersof the soul and ensuring its immortality. He found, however, that itwas even more dangerous to content himself with man’s ignorance ofthe nature of the soul and to resort to such solutions as offered by the“spirits of life.” That he regarded this as an empty phrase appears fromironic statements about earlier scholars’s efforts to bridge the abyss be-tween soul and body created by Descartes: It was on this account that they called these emissaries, “spirits,” adding also the predicate, “animal,” so as to have some words to ex-press the medium, and at the same time to convey that these spiritswere as thoroughly unknown as the spirit of man apart from thebody. They selected the expression because they could not deny thenexus, and yet were in the dark as to its nature. 29 Why not try, instead, to apply the mechanistic laws to this area also and in that way allow psychology to make the same progress achieved by geography and anatomy in recent times? The solution to that problem required a gigantic research pro- gram, which even today remains far from complete, if even begun, andSwedenborg was largely aware of this. His essay has, indeed, the char- acter of a test paper in a scientific seminar, a draft of a working hy- pothesis.

Diderot’s Conversations between d’Alembert and Diderot and D’Alembert’s Dream often bring to mind Swedenborg’s quivering nerve fibers, which is understandable, ofcourse, in view of the common Cartesian background. Even though Swedenborg’s intent was the direct reverse of the ma- terialists, the associations with them are justified, since their consis-tently sensualist method corresponds to an important degree withSwedenborg’s own ideal at the time. As he then experienced the prob-lem, the chief risk of using unproven “spirits of life” was that modernscientists would be tempted to deny the independent existence of thespiritual. To avoid such disasters, Swedenborg set up the incredible ob-jective for his own research that we have met twice before: ut ipsis sen- sibus demonstretur animae immortalitas, so that the immortality of thesoul may be proven to the senses themselves. The outline of this enormous research program was presented in the form of thirteen propositions. The first seven give general episte-mological premises, repeating, among other things, the general theoryof elements from Principia, but with the eighth Swedenborg proceeds directly to the human body. He begins with the construction of the sense of hearing, referring clearly back to the tremor essays of fifteen years earlier. Every part of the body is assumed to be covered by a membrane. This is a repetition of the proposition of his studies as a young man, but it must be based in part on analogies, since not even the strongest microscope could yet reveal the most delicatemembranes. After emphasizing the part played by the bodily fluids in distend- ing these membranes, Swedenborg sets forth his tenth proposition:that exact harmony must exist between the membranes and the ele-ments if the elements’s movements are to be transmitted to all parts ofthe organism. Here he states outright, although the details were left fora later investigation, that “the vibratory or undulating motions in theF r o m I n o r g a n i c t o O r g a n i c N a t u r e 43"

As established in the eleventhproposition, these laws are characterized by harmonious propor-tions, and the movements are transmitted quickly and surely to theextent that the bodily membranes are in harmony. If this is not thecase, the soul can only be reached by obscure and painful reports, towhich it can become habituated; as a result, the body’s influence onthe soul will become increasingly strong. This is extremely danger-ous, the reason being that, when a soul in this state is finally releasedfrom its body, it can only experience discomfort and pain in contactwith an otherworld existence of incomprehensible perfection andharmony. This warning is a most interesting harbinger of Swedenborg’s theosophical period. The distribution of spirits between heaven andhell in the spiritual world, to which souls come after the death of thebody, is determined by the choice of the spirits themselves: an impurespirit cannot exist in the realms of the blessed, but must voluntarilyseek out its sullied peers. The question then arises as to the extent to which an individual can influence his own membranous system. The thirteenth and lastproposition treats the problem of the soul’s site in the body. Sweden-borg explained that it is not to be found in any special gland or singlemembrane but that it must be in the organ in which the membranehas achieved the highest level, in other words, in the brain, primarily the cortical substance but also parts of the marrow such as themedullaoblongata.Such a relationship to the brain would inevitably mean that souls are not identical, but vary according to the physiological founda-tion. It should be mentioned, however, that Swedenborg, in a shortsketch of the same period entitled Generaliter de motu elementorum (Generalities on the Motion of the Elements) claimed that the shape of the fibers and the muscles of the body and the cerebellum areV i s i o n a r y S c i e n t i s t 44"

Against that background, we can sense the earnestness withwhich Swedenborg was searching for the truth about the soul: theknowledge he could acquire would finally determine the course of hiseternal life. The extremely detailed discussions and the tremendous ac-cumulation of facts are comprehensible in the light of his need to cre-ate a line of reasoning based on as solid associations as the elements orthe membranes of the body—otherwise the brain would be structuredin a way that would allow the soul to cultivate dangerously unharmo-nious errors. The short essay obviously had a very concrete intellectual founda- tion, even though Swedenborg refrained from presenting especiallyprecise details. Meantime, several of his manuscripts go much further;but it is difficult to decide how convinced he was of the truth of hisspeculations—like other scholars, he should be allowed the right to bejudged according to the works he felt he could publish. Nevertheless,they are of great value as illustrations of the force of his purely naturalphilosophical inspiration. One sketch experiments with the construction of the soul—called here anima rationalis, an Aristotelian term that later became Sweden- borg’s usual designation of the highest spiritual function—proceedingfrom the actives of the first and second finites that, according to thePrincipiamodel, form small spaces on whose surfaces the passive ele- ments are collected. These spaces and surfaces together form an extra-ordinarily subtle membrane, which he thus believed enclosed the soul. Animals possess the same membrane, according to the sketch, buttheir “soul space” is made of grosser material, one of the ingredients ofwhich is the magnetic element from Principia. This explains their in- stinctive recognition of north and south, their miraculous sense of di-rection, an opinion that Swedenborg maintained in published worksalso.

When the body dies and turns into dust, these soul ballsare removed by angels. Swedenborg does not specify, however, whetherthey later regain their former appearance in a particular locality, butthis would be quite in line with his other reasoning, at the same time asit is an early augury of Swedenborg’s notions of the spiritual worldafter 1745 and the “substantial” bodies of the spirits. 31 In another manuscript, consisting of annotated excerpts from the philosopher Christian Wolff’s newly published Psychologia empirica (Empirical Psychology, 1732), Swedenborg went furthest in concre-tion, so far, in fact, that he even drew a sketch of the membranes of thesoul. He assumed that the innermost parts of the soul are spiral inform and can thus be regarded as a sort of rigid Cartesian vortex. Thereason for this shape is that it permits different influences, dependingon the nature of the tremor that reaches it. This means that there areinfinite possibilities of individual variations, in the same way as there isno such thing as two exactly identical musical instruments, eventhough their mutual harmony is perfect—still another example ofSwedenborg’s tendency to describe the activity of the soul in musicalanalogies. Above the spiral convolutions of the soul, there is another exces- sively sensitive membrane, said to enclose the first element of nature,created by the first force according to Principia, and then still another containing the second magnetic element. On top of that there is a thirdmembrane consisting of the third element of nature that, according to Swedenborg’s reinterpretation of Descartes’s physics, constitutes ether,and after that follow two more membranes filled with subtle fluids.The whole is assumed to be enclosed in a membrane composed ofblood vessels. Finally, Swedenborg asserted that future research wouldconfirm his hypothesis, and his train of thought is well illustrated inthe following passage: “If we had the microscope, we might be able tosee the entire structure both of the soul and of the spirit” 32—a micro- scope of sufficient strength and clarity, that is!

Judging by a dispositional outline in onemanuscript, it would lead up to a theological perspective or, more pre-cisely, to the purpose of the creation so self-evident to a scholar withSwedenborg’s background, namely, the kingdom of God. 34But it is not hard to grasp the enormous work implied by the title, and it is equallyclear that the plans were impracticable. The period up to 1745 was filled with hectic work on at least three different projected publications. Besides the Oeconomiaseries already embarked on, Swedenborg had a plan for a number of short treatises,which would take up one problem at a time, and a great project tocomprise not less than seventeen volumes, which would be given thetitle proposed for the original plan—Regnum Animale, “The AnimalKingdom,” in the sense of the human body—and which would presentthe entire physiological and psychological structure of man based on detailed investigations of each separate organ. Swedenborg had time topublish only three volumes of this series before he was diverted fromthis work and set out to summarize his philosophy in poetic form inDe Cultu et Amore Dei (The Worship and Love of God). This work, too, remained unfinished. In April 1745, the author received the deci- sive call to devote the rest of his days to interpreting the Bible accord- ing to such principles as prevailed in the golden age of paradise. 35V i s i o n a r y S c i e n t i s t 48"

It will be necessary to confine ourselves to what seems to be par-ticularly essential, and this means that we must examine howSwedenborg carried out his psycho-physical speculations by profoundstudies of the anatomy and physiology of the brain. That we are justi-fied in doing this appears from a quick look ahead at a theosophicalwork from 1763, Sapientia Angelica de Divino Amore et Divina Sapien- tia(Divine Love and Wisdom). The book ends with the following statement on the human fetus, which is based on what the angels hadtold the author: The initiament or primitive of man as it is in the womb after con- ception, no man can know, because it cannot be seen; and also it is ofspiritual substance which does not fall into vision through naturallight. Now because there are some in the world whose bent it is toexplore even the primitive of man, which is the seed from the father,by which conception is effected; and because many of these personshave fallen into the error of supposing that man is in his fulness byhis first conception, which is but his beginning, and that afterwardshe is perfected by mere enlargement of growth; therefore it has beendiscovered to me what that inchoate or first thing is in its form. Thiswas discovered to me by the angels, to whom it was revealed by theLord. They, because they had made it a subject of their wisdom, andit is the joy of their wisdom to communicate to others what theyknow, by permission presented the initial form of man in a type be-fore my eyes in the light of heaven. Which was as follows. There was seen as it were a least image of a brain with a subtle delineation of somewhat of a face in front, with no appendage. Thisprimitive in the upper gibbous part was a compages of contiguousglobules or spherules, and every spherule was compacted of othersstill more minute, and every one of these in like manner of spherulesmost minute. Thus it was of three degrees. In front, in the flat part, a kind of delineation for a face was apparent. The gibbous part wascovered round with a most fine membrane or meninx, which wastransparent. This gibbous part, which was a type of the brain on theleast scale, was also divided into two as it were beds, as the brain onF r o m I n o r g a n i c t o O r g a n i c N a t u r e 49"

Moreover it was shown in the light ofheaven, which shone with favouring effulgence, that the compages ofthis little brain within, as to make and fluxion, was in the order andin the form of heaven, and that its outer compages was in direct op-position to that order and that form. After these things were seen and pointed out, the angels said, that the two internal degrees, which were in the order and in theform of heaven, were the receptacles of love and wisdom from theLord; and that the exterior degree, which was in direct opposition tothe order and the form of heaven, was the receptacle of hellish loveand insanity; because man by hereditary corruption is born intoevils of every kind; and that these evils reside there in the extremes;and that this corruption is not removed unless the higher degrees beopened, which, as was said, are the receptacles of love and wisdomfrom the Lord. And because love and wisdom is very man, for loveand wisdom in its essence is the Lord, and this primitive of man is areceptacle, it follows that thence in that primitive there is a continualtravail into the human form, which also it puts on successively. 36 This is one in an endless row of examples of how Swedenborg’s re- searches on the physiology of the brain gave his spiritual experiencesan extremely concrete character, and it also indicates his evaluation ofcontemporary generation theories, for example, Swammerdam’s pre-formation theory. Swedenborg’s contributions in the area of brain research are among the best known of his scientific works, and it has been claimed that his theories on the location of the mental processes in the cerebralcortex were far ahead of his time and, in part, deserve high praise. 37 However, what little he himself published of his brain studies drownedin the mass of more sensational material, and it was not until Rudolph L. Tafel published a kind of anthology of manuscripts in the 1880s that it became clear how far-sighted Swedenborg had been. 38It should nev- ertheless be stressed that, in this field also, he adhered to the methodmentioned earlier: he applied his brain to what others had worked onV i s i o n a r y S c i e n t i s t 50"

Swedenborg himself did not publish any brain studies other than the introductory chapters to Part II of Oeconomia(1740–1741). The motif for the entire work, which was based on investigations of thecomposition of the blood, is presented in the first sentence of the firstvolume: The animal kingdom, the economy of which I am about to consider anatomically, physically, and philosophically, regards the blood as itscommon fountain and general principle. In undertaking, therefore,to treat of this economy, the doctrine of the blood must be the firstpropounded, although it is the last that is capable of being broughtto completion. 39 This is quite logical in view of the emphasis on the elements’ move- ments in the body, which appeared in the treatise on the mechanism ofsoul and body in 1734. Swedenborg now believed he could distinguishthree different degrees of blood, from ordinary red blood via a purerform to the highest, which is identical with the spirit of life, and hebased his views mainly on Leeuwenhoek’s microscopic discoveries ofthe blood corpuscles. This classification created entirely new possibilities for weaving the physiological and mental processes into an all-inclusive circulation,which appears not least clearly from a glance at the description of thecerebral cortex, the point of departure for the study of the brain in Oe- conomia. In the very first manuscripts on the physiology of the brain,roughly dated by Alfred Acton at 1738, Swedenborg concluded fromhis sources that the cortex is the noblest part of the brain and that it consists of innumerable small parts held together by the finest fibers emanating from the outermost arterial vessels in the pia meninx, thevascular membrane that lies closest to the surface of the brain. 40 Through the arteries in this membrane flows the purest blood, the spirit of life, into the cortical substance, and from there it moves on tothe fibers that form the medullar parts of the brain, the spiral marrow,and the nervous system.F r o m I n o r g a n i c t o O r g a n i c N a t u r e 51"

Here it occupies the same place and marks the border betweenphysical and psychical in the body of man. But in contrast to the math-ematical point, the cortex of the brain is exceedingly complex. Itssmallest parts, the brain cells— cerebellulaor sphaerulae, to borrow Swedenborg’s own terms—are admittedly products of branches ofblood vessels, although they cannot be regarded as vessels themselvesbut rather as a kind of membrane enclosed in spheres. Once more wefind ourselves very close to the mechanistic model of 1734. Armed with microscopes, Leeuwenhoek and Malpighi had already reached this point, but Swedenborg’s imagination would not let himrest there. He conceived of cells of even more advanced and more per-fect form, comprising a kind of cortex cerebelluli, a cerebral cortex of the brain cell. Each one of these brain cells he regarded as a miniaturebrain, which gives rise to an indefinite number of “brain particles,” in the same way as the physical particles are indefinitely divisible in Prin- cipia. To make these subtle materials more concrete, let us look ahead to the anatomical demonstration which Swedenborg let an angel make, when he gave his imagination free rein and poetic shape in De Cultu et Amore Dei in 1745.

It was also rendered visible, in what manner thisform taken from little spheres, by the variations of itself and changesof state, produced ideas called material; and in what manner each lit-tle sphere sent forth a diminutive fibre with its little duct and cov-ered it with a small coat; and how natural life was infused into itfrom the lowest spiritual fountain which inhabits that sphere with itsgenii, and excites its organic principles. . . .

A consistent characteristic of his writings after the crisis of his conversion is that he describes the world of spirits inhuman biological, not least cerebro-physiological terms; as early as inArcana Coelestia, heaven is seen as a great human being in whom allorgans are represented through innumerable spiritual societies. A gen-eral inspiration for this vision may have been Plato’s The Republic ; of greater importance, obviously, are the decades of study and specula-tion centered on the most subtle structures of the organism. By com-bining his experiences of these years with the most audaciousanalogical reasoning, Swedenborg’s imagination finally succeeded inbridging over the Cartesian abyss between matter and spirit. Nevertheless, when the time came to edit Oeconomiaat the end of the 1730s, Swedenborg still had a long road to travel. This extensivework has in no measure received the attention it deserves from thescholarly community, but it has much to offer, not least on the prob-lem of the spirits of life. In the mechanistic essay of 1734, we saw thatSwedenborg was striving to get away from a concept which he foundinexact and “occult,” and to replace it by a realistic, empiricallyfounded understanding of the movements of the elements in the body.It might seem that he himself was now guilty of the same occultism.After all, he presents here a rather definite hypothesis to the effect thatthe spiritual fluid, which appears to be identical with the spirit of life,is produced by the innermost degree of brain cells and flows out intothe organism through two channels, partly via the nerves and partly incombination with the blood. The theory is new to the extent that itpresupposes a more universal circulation than that of the blood, and it is thus unquestionably more sophisticated than Descartes’ concept ofthe epiphysis as an exchange center for information between soul andbody. Above all, it provides some sort of an explanation of the vitalfunction of the cerebral cortex. But it does not give an answer to thequestion of how spirituality can be combined with an organic fluid,and this, of course, is the crucial problem. Nor did Swedenborg believe that this theory provided the answer. He still did not master the language that would make possible the all-inclusive formulations required to solve the problem.

The cells ofthe brain undergo changes according to environmental variations, thatis, primarily according to the condition of the blood, and this meansthat they adapt themselves to the auras or elements of nature. The earis influenced by modulations in the air, and the eye adapts itself tochanges in the ether. Hence, the same must be true of the inner sen-sory organs in relation to the higher auras in nature, which have amuch greater ability to penetrate tissues than the physical media ofsound and light. Characteristically, Swedenborg looked for support to two great scholars, Swammerdam, who described the air passages in certain in-sects in a way that Swedenborg could associate with blood vessels inhigher beings, and Leeuwenhoek, who showed that the movements ofthe blood corpuscles can be influenced by air currents. It was on thisfoundation that he constructed his analogical conclusion: red bloodrepresents air in the organism, the purer blood the ether. The spiritualfluid must then be affected by the highest auras of nature, in animalsby the next highest, that is, the magnetic, which, as already said, wouldexplain their sense of direction, and in man by the highest. It seems clear that we must not take this to mean that Swedenborg believed in an automatic influence by the natural elements on man.This is inconceivable by the very fact that the brain itself can changethe trends of its reactions, which is a physiological way of establishingfreedom of will, something that Swedenborg never wished or dared toquestion. But, in addition, the influence of the auras is modified to suit the specific qualities of the organism, the most important of which, of course, is life. These modifications include heat in nature equivalent to anger in man, cold to fear, expansion to pride, motion to action. 43 Obviously it became more difficult for Swedenborg to establish these connections the further he reached in psychical complexities, buthere he repeatedly refers to a sort of mathematical universal language that could formulate psychical and physical phenomena with the helpof the same system of symbols.

In the famous remarks ofthe old Sir Isaac Newton, the great idol of the Enlightenment: “I do notknow what I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem to havebeen only like a boy playing on the seashore, and diverting myself innow and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordi-nary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.” 44 The Concept of the Formative Force We shall return to the problem of a universal language later on, but be-fore we do so other biological phenomena must be discussed. As men-tioned in the introductory survey, Cartesian mechanistic biology wasespecially vulnerable when it came to explaining the origin of new liv-ing organisms. It is thus quite natural that Swedenborg exceeded hisCartesian limitations in the section of Oeconomiaconcerning the gen- esis of an organism. This section treats one of the favorite topics ofcontemporary biology and proceeds from the work of the great Italiananatomist Malpighi issued in 1672 under the same title as Sweden- borg’s chapter, De formatione pulli in ovo (On the Formation of the Chick in the Egg). The real purpose was to prove that it is the brain that is first formed in the egg, while the heart and the blood vessels come next. The consequences are important enough in themselves, but even more significant is another principle advanced quite unexpectedly, namely,that a formative force, vis formatrix , is present in the organism.

This is called by some the plastic force, and the Ar-chaeus; by others, simply nature in action; but I think it will be moreintelligible if in reference to the work of formation we term it theformative force and substance. 45 Swedenborg did not closely define this force, however; and when he refers to it once more in the drama of creation De Cultu et Amore Dei in 1745 in connection with the genesis of plants, he again evaded hisobligation to give a definition: The first generating or plastic force, innate in the very seeds of veg- etable foetuses, may be likened to a soul. . . . But what the quality ofthis seminal force is, cannot be known but by unfolding the forms ofprior nature, both those which have reference to active and thosewhich have reference to passive powers, also in what manner thesolar rays operate to join them together, to evolve which, from laststo firsts, would be too vast an undertaking. 46 There is, however, a highly respectable reason for this unwillingness to spell out a definition, which is also significant in evaluating the influ-ence of Descartes. A strict definition simply cannot be achieved withthe language at our disposal, since the phenomenon is beyond thesphere of words; once more what is needed is the artificial philosophi- cal-mathematical language for which Swedenborg so frequently ex- pressed a need during his last decade as a natural scientist. It isimportant to bear in mind that this desire for a mathematical lan-guage, which he shared with so many of his predecessors, had one of its roots in Descartes. For this reason alone, Swedenborg need not have regarded his theory of the formative substance as a radical breakwith the past, but rather as a new attempt to arrive at a more subtle,mechanistic system than his teacher’s. His choice of terminology alsopoints in that direction. He speaks of a formative force, vis formatrix,F r o m I n o r g a n i c t o O r g a n i c N a t u r e 57"

It is another matter that, ever since Aristotle, the concept of form has been so fraught with meta-physical import that it led his thoughts to other domains than the geometrical. The other terms Swedenborg mentioned, vis plastica, Archaeus, natura agens , caused certain scholars to draw conclusions concerning his affiliation with a “mystical” philosophy of nature of ancient vintage.Archaeusbelongs to Paracelsus (1493–1541) and John Baptiste van Hel- mont (1577–1644) and thus is associated with Renaissance medicineand the iatrochemical principles of the seventeenth century. Vis plastica is a term belonging to the Cambridge Platonists, and recalls Cudworth’sand Henry More’s aspirations in the England of the end of the seven-teenth century to combine Christianity and philosophy into a kind ofmodern Platonism. Listing the terms, however, tells nothing of themore profound influences. It is probable that Swedenborg acquired hisknowledge in some handbook or another, e.g., Johann ChristopherSturm’s Physica electiva sive hypothetica (1697), a long and eclectic text- book in physics, where he could acquire broad knowledge of the olderas well as the more recent philosophy of nature; all the terms andsources to which he refers are thoroughly reviewed and analyzed in it. 47 It is less rewarding to attempt to put Swedenborg in a framework of “mystical” philosophy of nature with direct connections to the Re-naissance than to examine his relationship with the intellectual dia-logue of the times. Oeconomia Regni Animalis was prepared during his years of foreign travel and begun in Paris. Swedenborg found the in-tellectual environment of France familiar and attractive in many re-spects. It is true that Descartes had been severely criticized onimportant points, though not more severely than by himself, but the Cartesian rationalistic methodology was nevertheless still thefoundation of French natural science. The Anglophile Voltaire com-plained at this very time about what he considered the backwardnessof French science, both in his banned and burned Lettres philosophiques and in the tolerated but controversial Eléments de la Philosophie de Newton .

Voltaire contrasted such representatives of seventeenth-century ra- tionalism as Malebranche and Leibniz with his English ideals, Newtonand Locke. (I shall return later to Locke’s significance to Swedenborg.)From this distance, both Malebranche and Leibniz appear to have beenmore important than most as sources of inspiration for Swedenborg.True, he had known of them earlier via different handbooks, but heappeared not to have begun a systematic study of their works untilafter his stay in France. Considerable space is devoted to both of themin the philosophical and psychological excerpts, which were collectedin the manuscript 36-110 beginning about 1740. 49 It cannot be proved that it was Voltaire’s books written in England that stimulated these studies—scarcely anything can be proved aboutSwedenborg’s activities in Paris, except that earlier allegations abouthis studies at l’Ecole de Chirurgie are completely unfounded. 50On the other hand, the intellectual milieu unquestionably provided numerousexamples showing that the rationalism of Malebranche and Leibniz was still alive, not least when applied to biology. In his great study on the influence of the biological sciences on French thought in the eigh- teenth century, Jacques Roger repeatedly refers to these two great menand their relations with the natural scientists: For Malebranche as for Leibniz, God subjected Himself to order and did not act without an adequate foundation, and this foundation,F r o m I n o r g a n i c t o O r g a n i c N a t u r e 59"

Great scientistslike Malpighi, Tournefort, Vallisneri, and Réaumur believed in aGodgiven order which science can come to understand. 51 This is the tradition to which Swedenborg belongs. It might ap- pear antiquated in a situation where the deistic attacks from England were becoming increasingly violent, with their demands that naturalscience should confine itself to describing and formulating laws asaccurately as possible and forget its ambition to explain the mostprofound causes, Newton’s statement hypotheses non fingobeing the leading model. At the same time, it is important to recall that Leibnizexperienced a sort of renaissance in France during the years immedi-ately following 1735, due in part to the spread of Wolffianism in Ger-many; and even those who rejected Leibniz’s metaphysics retainedhis monad concept in both organic and inorganic contexts as a basisfor an atomistic approach to nature. Roger even speaks of a “néo-Leibnizianisme” during this period, that is, when Swedenborg wasliving in Paris. 52Thus we have every reason to study Leibniz’s influ- ence in Oeconomia, which means that we can pick up the threads from the beginning of this chapter, beginning with the genesis of theorganisms. Swedenborg quoted Leibniz’s theodicy in the Latin edition of 1739. In the preface, Leibniz refers to Cudworth’s vis plasticain a con- troversial sense, asserting that he could not find it necessary to resortto special formative powers to explain the origin of organisms. It canbe explained to complete satisfaction within the framework of a mech- anistic system, assuming that one accepts pre-existence in seed and eggs. But the embryological theory is placed in a greater context, whichis the essential one: To explain this miracle, the formation of organisms, I employ a pre- determined harmony, that is to say, the same means I used to explainanother miracle, the correspondence between soul and body, where Iproved the uniformity and fertility of the principles I myself haveused. 53V i s i o n a r y S c i e n t i s t 60"

      "text": "As is well known, the question of the relationship between soul and body became a problem of crucial importance after Descartes and was of constant concern to Swedenborg. In Leibniz, Swedenborg dis-covered an attempt to solve it together with the problem of the originof organisms within the framework of a single intellectual model,namely, the concept of a harmonia praestabilita , a predetermined harmony. At first glance, it might seem unjustified to draw a parallel with Leibniz, since Swedenborg flatly rejected the idea of preexistence, theidea that an infinitesimal model of the complete organism is present inthe egg, which simply increases in size. Despite the fact that he pro-ceeded from Malpighi, he seems to have adopted the opposite opinion,according to which the organism develops from a completely chaoticmass in the egg, a notion that is often attributed to Aristotle and thatwas shared by both Harvey and Descartes. 54However, the essential point is not this technical difference, which is of subordinate impor-tance, but rather the idea of the concept of force, the force thatSwedenborg identified with the soul in organic contexts. Here the cor-respondence with Leibniz is striking. In Système nouveau de la Nature et de la Communication des Sub- stances(1695), Leibniz described the development of his thinking. He tells how, after he had discarded Aristotle, he became engrossed inideas of empty space and atoms. But these ideas did not suffice to ex-plain the existence of unity; the principles of unity could not be tracedexclusively to matter, to whatever is passive. Nothing then remainedbut to resuscitate the substantial forms so maligned at the time, whichled to a pronounced Aristotelian renaissance in the Leibniz tradition.Leibniz found the true essence of these forms in the force concept,which was regarded as related to human feelings and passions, hence analogous with the soul concept. But the soul cannot be used to ex-plain every detail of the utilitarian construction of the body, nor canthe substantial forms be used in analyzing each individual problem innature. Instead they simply comprise the essential prerequisite for the creation of true general principles, while the rest of nature must beF r o m I n o r g a n i c t o O r g a n i c N a t u r e 61"

These forms and souls would have to be indivisible, like the human soul, but this posed new and difficult problems. Every sub- stance that comprises a true unity can neither come into existence norcease to exist except by a miracle, and the forms must therefore be theresult of an act of creation, in the same way as Genesis taught us aboutthe human soul. It was precisely in this connection that Swammer-dam’s, Malpighi’s, and Leeuwenhoek’s observations were so useful toLeibniz, since he saw in them the opportunity to interpret that whichappeared to be the birth of an organism not as a truly new creation butas a transformation of an organism created in the beginning. As hasbeen pointed out, Leibniz, by regarding seed as possessing a kind ofsoul from the beginning, constructed a biological entity equipped withits specific energy. Thereby he achieved an outline of a dynamic theory,which, in the long run, defeated the mechanistically rigid system hewas trying to save. This is especially noticeable in his treatment of Leeuwenhoek’s an- imalculist theory. (Swedenborg’s knowledge of this and other contem-porary theories of procreation is clearly revealed in many of hisworks.) The discoverer himself had assumed that the spermatozoacontained a motor principle, or a kind of soul, from the creation, andthey therefore represented in Leibniz’s eyes the perfect example ofthose bodies with which every soul—or every monad, to use a morespecifically Leibnizian term—is constantly united and which them-selves are subject to the conditions of constant change. At the momentof conception, each animalculum takes on a new shape, which allows itto absorb nourishment and to increase in size and, after the fetal stage,to emerge into a new and greater arena. To sidestep Leeuwenhoek’s difficulty in explaining how humans can develop from diminutive animalcula, Leibniz tried one or twolines of reasoning. According to one, the souls possessed by human spermatozoa have no intelligence until after fertilization, but this is a transformation that requires divine intervention. He also enter-tained another notion, namely, that only the spermatozoa intendedV i s i o n a r y S c i e n t i s t 62"

Both solutions, nevertheless, have the same fa-vorable result in one important respect: they dispense with the trou-blesome idea of a mass death of human Anlage,since those “worms” that do not develop into beings remain worms and nothing butworms. This result is in line with a basic tendency in Leibniz’s entire ideal- ism: there is actually neither birth nor death in nature but only trans-formations and changes in forms of manifestation. 56The parallel with Swedenborg is remarkable in this respect also, in fact so close that wehave reason to see his final vision of spiritual societies concentrated ina universal human figure as a concretion of Leibniz’s monad theory, asa realization of the uttermost consequences of the system of pre-estab-lished harmony in the imagination of a poet and prophet. Leibniz could thus make excellent use of Leeuwenhoek’s micro- scopic discoveries in developing his thinking, but he was not inclinedto harness his philosophy to a scientific theory that could be disprovedby later research. In the long run, it turned out that Leibniz’s philoso-phy led away from the pre-existence theories, both the ovist and theanimalculist version, and toward a dynamic point of view. It has beenquestioned whether Leibniz was on the verge of such a radically newconcept as evolution. 57However, the texts that would justify this spec- ulation were not found until 1765, almost fifty years after Leibniz’sdeath, when Nouveaux Essais sur l’Entendement humain (New Essays concerning Human Understanding) were published. The result was a renaissance for Leibniz, this, again, being an important factor in the genesis of the philosophy of German Romanticism. From our point ofview, it is essential to note that the innate dynamism of Leibniz’s sys-tem had long before that time belonged to the essence of Swedenborg’sbiological thinking, and it occasionally seems as if too little attention has been paid to Swedenborg as a link between seventeenth-centuryrationalism and the natural philosophy of Romanticism. In any case, it is unquestionable that he further advanced Leibniz’s dynamistic ideas.F r o m I n o r g a n i c t o O r g a n i c N a t u r e 63"

Not until then could one visualize the se- quence of autonomous psychic entities, each one, according to its abil- ity, a reflection of the entire universe—a concept that allowed Leibnizto transform the Cartesian machine into a spiritual organism. In theperiod between Leibniz’s death in 1716 and the publication of Nou- veaux Essais , the principal advocate of Leibnizianism was Christian Wolff (1679–1754), the prototype of the solid German scholar, who, ina long series of handbooks, reduced Leibniz’s constantly evolving phi-losophy to a rigid system that could be taught to large numbers of stu-dents in the classroom. At least this is the usual view of Wolff, spicedwith the absurd optimism of Voltaire’s caricature, Doctor Pangloss inCandide. But like all popular evaluations, this too is one-sided and mislead- ing, and even Voltaire had expressed his appreciation of Wolff in ear-lier works: in the famous biography of Charles XII, for example, hecalled him “that renowned and eminent connoisseur of all branches ofphilosophy.” 58In Swedenborg’s time, Wolff was regarded both as a preacher of dangerous heresies—in 1723 he was expelled from the uni-versity in Halle by the pietistic faculty of theology, which was asadamantly opposed to freedom of thought as its orthodox foes—andas a bold pioneer, the formulator of a highly attractive modern ratio-nalism. As has been shown by Tore Frängsmyr, Wolff’s philosophy wasregarded with great suspicion by the authorities in Sweden in the be-ginning of the 1730s, but at the end of the decade it came into favor instead. 59 Even if he thus had to be rather cautious in public, both in Prin- cipiaand De Infinito , Swedenborg became fascinated by Wolff and his psychological, ontological, and cosmological series of handbooks inthe early 1730s. It is true that he later changed his opinion—in cer- tain memorabilia from the spiritual world, Wolff was pictured in humiliating situations and always subordinate to Leibniz; still, thereis no doubt that Wolff was of great importance to Swedenborg, particularly in his psychophysical thinking during his last decade as a scientist.

He felt himself calledupon to clarify his own stand by reading Leeuwenhoek’s self-asssuredand somewhat aggressive presentation, and this makes the oft-quotedfinal lines more understandable, at least on one point. Leeuwenhoekfrequently expresses himself hypothetically and uses the formula si verum est(if this is true), and one has the feeling that Swedenborg replied to the dead microscopist: haec vera sunt quia signum habeo (these things are true because I have the sign). The meaning of this reference to “signs” will be discussed later, but the episode itself is a thrilling presage of what will be so common inthe descriptions of the spiritual world contained in the theosophicalwritings.

The first time he took up the question was in the final chapter of OeconomiaI, entitled “Introduction to Ra- tional Psychology,” and it is by no means only the title that recallsWolff’s writings. Swedenborg presents three hypotheses to explain the relationship between soul and body: (1) the traditional view as it was developed by Aristotle and Scholasticism, which asserts that there is a direct exchange of bodilyreports and spiritual orders; Swedenborg employs the usual term, in- fluxus physicus (bodily inflow). (2) Occasionalism, the notion that each transfer from spiritual to physical and vice versa can only be explained by divine intervention;Swedenborg ascribed this view to Descartes, as was usual at the time,although it was actually elaborated by his disciples Guelincx and Male-branche and others. (3) The harmonia praestabilita theory, Leibniz–Wolff’s idea to the effect that there is actually no relationship between soul and body, butinstead that predetermined parallel events occur in such a way as togive the impression of relationships. The psychophysical parallel the-ory developed by Spinoza is never mentioned by Swedenborg, and itspantheistic motivation was naturally inconceivable to him, as it was tohis contemporaries. His own final solution, however, closely resembleda parallel theory, as we shall see later. In Oeconomia, however, Swedenborg was dissatisfied with all three theories, considering that they assumed that the soul immediately flows into the sphere of bodily effects, whether this originates in itsown inherent principles or in some superior ones, and he found thatthis would be to draw premature conclusions. 64What was needed was a more profound understanding of the order of life. and before he pro-vided his own solution he tried to formulate a doctrine of the coher- ence of things. He calls this the theory of series and degrees: later he defines it with the doctrine for which his name became best known, namely, the theory of correspondence.

In direct connection with clarissimus Wolffius, the renowned Wolff, Swedenborg explained that the most extensive of these series naturally consists of the naturaluniverse itself. Within this universe there are, in turn, six great series,three higher and three lower. The first of the high series originates inthe first substance of nature. The second consists of the substances ofthe first—Swedenborg uses the term “substance” at several levels,which scarcely contributes to clarity—when they have been released togyrate in Cartesian movements, which gives rise to the element fire.And the third comprises the four auras of nature. The three lower se-ries consist of the three kingdoms of nature, mineral, vegetable, andanimal. 65Each one of these great series consists, in turn, of a multitude of subordinate series, just as the cerebral cortex constitutes a seriesmade up of an indefinite number of brain cell series. It is not difficultto recognize Swedenborg’s pattern from Leeuwenhoek’s attempts toexplain what he saw in the microscope. Thus, the only exception to this universal affiliation with series is the first substance of nature. However, as was first asserted by Aristotle,we can have no certain understanding of this but can draw only someanalogical conclusions. Swedenborg also quickly dropped this problemand instead concentrated on the first substance in each series, that is,“substance” in a transferred sense. All series have a first substance ofthis kind, as many scholars have established, and terms like monadand simple substance have been used to define it. But Swedenborg disap- proved of all earlier terminology, about which he had learned partlyfrom Wolff’s textbooks in ontology and cosmology and partly from apre-Cartesian handbook of 1636, for the reason that all terms that tryto suggest simplicity for these first substances give the inaccurate and dangerous impression that they originate directly in the first substanceof nature. 66In this way, one could be misled to believe that all the im- perfections and flaws in nature are directly caused by nature’s first sub-stance or were contained in it at creation.

Obviously, he himself experienced one of the great problems inherentin the idea of pre-established harmony at this very point, and he tried in various ways to evade the static, the pre-determined in theLeibniz–Wolff model. In Oeconomia, Swedenborg suggests that harmo- nia praestabilita be replaced by what he calls harmonia constabilita, a successively developing harmony, in which the substance of each se-ries, according to decreasing capacity, tries to carry out the intentionsof the first substance. 67Here we see most distinctly Swedenborg’s strong dynamism, at the same time as his close kinship with Leibniz isvery apparent. To some extent, naturally, the contrast with Leibniz is illusory, and it can probably be explained largely by the fact that Swedenborg pro-ceeded from Leibnizianism in the rather scholastic form Wolff gave it.Swedenborg also must have believed that the highest form of harmonywas predestined in a specific phenomenon, namely, in the first sub-stance of nature, which is beyond and above the entire system of seriesand degrees in the Creator’s first realization of himself in his nature. Inbiological contexts, Leibniz, in turn, had the same idea as Swammer-dam—that original sin could be interpreted as a concrete fact withinorganic nature. It is indisputable that Swedenborg tried hard to learnWolff’s system and terminology, but it is equally clear that he did not want to do so slavishly; his irritation is unmistakable on many occasions. The theory of series and degrees was developed in close relation- ship with mathematical terminology, and Swedenborg clearly pro-ceeded from Wolff’s definition of the concept of series and degrees,although at times he went further in mathematical concretion than theGerman philosopher. For example, Wolff refrained from using Leibniz’sterm monadwhen referring to the simple elements of the body, proba- bly because he wanted to avoid the mathematical associations of theword and of its Latin translation, unitas, unit.

Even at its preparatory stage,his struggle with a mathematical language may have helped to lay theground for the symbolization of reality, which slowly took shape duringthis period. It is noteworthy that Swedenborg’s terminological observa-tions end in a reminder of the ancient scholar for whom the world offigures became the world of mysticism: “The Pythagorean philosophyseems to have acknowledged similar units, having their harmonies andconcords, which it compares with the units of numbers.” 69 As he moved toward ever higher levels of complexity, Swedenborg constantly sought support both in the wisdom of the ancients and inthe sciences based on modern experience. In the struggle between les anciensand les modernes—the debate over many decades that in French intellectual history is usually called la querelle, “the quarrel”— Swedenborg thus took an intermediary stand, which is also apparent inhis treatment of the soul concept. As we have observed his way of han-dling it so far, it is a relatively simple and uniform concept: the soul incontrast to the body, the soul in coordination with the body, the soulas a spiritual being—all this sounds fairly comprehensible and intelli-gible. Contemporary authorities, who were still his mentors, were alsocontent with relatively simple concepts, although there were of courseexceptions. The situation changed when Swedenborg began to penetrate the problems of the soul in greater depth. Now he needed a much moresensitive and precise conceptual battery. Swedenborg himself indicatedthat the final chapter of Oeconomia Regni Animalis II, entitled “On the Human Soul,” represented the first fruits of his psychological endeav- ors; but even in the first part of Oeconomia,he had reached the point of identifying the soul fluid with the formative substance of the organ-ism.

In a posthumously published essay on thefibers of the body, which was intended to constitute part III of the Oe- conomiaseries, he expounded a doctrine of form that clearly reveals his tendency for hypostatic thinking; we shall return to this doctrine atthe end of the chapter. When in OeconomiaII he calls the spiritual fluid the form of forms, Swedenborg is nevertheless careful not to confuse it with whatAristotle called pure form—a kind of god concept—but stresses thatthe term should be regarded as a parallel to what Wolff called a repre-sentation of the universe. This obviously means that the fluidum spiri- tuosumincludes things that we cannot comprehend rationally. The spiritual fluid seems further to be identical with what Cartesian psy-chology called spiritus animalis, the spirit of life, but Swedenborg now tried a more daring approach: he identified fluidum spirituosum with the soul itself, with anima, to use his own Latin term. This is the most extreme expression of his original aspiration to regard the soul as a fi- nite being, capable of being penetrated by mechanistic methods. In itsphysiological manifestation, the spiritual fluid could thus be captured for analysis in a future which would have microscopes more powerfulthan Leeuwenhoek’s. To understand Swedenborg’s later development, we must obvi- ously retain this image of the soul as a constantly pulsating fluid in theorganism.

In its corresponding psy- chological gestalt, the spiritual fluid represents the highest form ofthought and emotion, a medium for life and wisdom as they flow fromthe divine source. Swedenborg makes a few pious observations on thisin the last chapter of Oeconomia, although still without crossing the line into theological domains. Of greatest importance, however, is thefact that during his work on ontological problems after 1736—a studyconducted primarily with the help of Wolff’s Ontologiaand two older handbooks, Scipion Dupleix’s Corps de Philosophie (1636) and Robert Baronius’s Metaphysica generalis , which provided Swedenborg with practically all his references to classical antiquity—he came increas-ingly to dissolve the boundaries between matter and spirit. 71Identify- ing the soul with the organic spiritual fluid seems to imply that thesoul must be regarded as material. Swedenborg had been warnedabout this in a review of De Infinitoin a learned German journal in 1735, but he was now inclined to consider the materiality of the soul asmore or less a question of terminology: if matter is defined as an ex-tended substance with inertia as an attribute, the soul is clearly imma-terial; but on the other hand everything substantial in nature can besaid to be matter. 72 Here Swedenborg alludes to Wolff’s distinction between transcen- dental and physical matter, but he completely disregards Wolff’s ad-monitions not to mix up these different meanings. The reason for thisself-assured attitude is that, with the help of the series doctrine, hecould distinguish a supreme level of existence, where it is no longer possible to speak of matter in the true sense of the word. This level islife’s, and, in its role as the receptive organ for life, the soul cannot becalled material, something that also applies in lesser degree to the other mental functions and even to the body: For all these live the life of their soul, and the soul lives the life of the spirit of God, who is not matter, but essence; whose esse is life;whose life is wisdom; and whose wisdom consists in beholding andembracing the ends to be promoted by the determinations of matterand the forms of nature.

The Psychological System Swedenborg expounded his psychology for the first time in Oeconomia and developed it in detail later in several unfinished essays in the 1740s;he also retained it in somewhat simplified form in his theosophicalwritings. 74He distinguishes between four different functions of con- sciousness. Highest is anima, the soul, the first and formative substance in the human series. Since animais beyond our actual intellectual life and thus beyond language too, we can have no knowledge of the soulexcept through analogy or through miracular experiences. Our intellec-tual process has its seat in reason, mens intellectualis , which comprises the second function of consciousness. On closer examination, it alsoforms a series of coordinated activities, which is particularly clear in thedraft of a psychological analysis written by Swedenborg for the Regnum Animaleseries, probably in 1742, and generally known as De Anima. 75 The third function he calls animus, and this corresponds rather closely with what Aristotle named the vegetative soul: Swedenborg regarded itas the seat of the passions. Finally we have the fourth function, whichconsists of the sensory organs of the body. The explanation of this classification is that it permits a parallel between the psyche and the four auras of nature, a combination thatearlier was tested in connection with the analysis of the blood and thespiritual fluid. In that way the following scheme could be constructed: (1) fluidum spirituosum or anima, the soul, corresponding to the highest aura of nature: its purpose is to represent the universe, to dis- cern ends intuitively, to be the highest form of consciousness and toconstitute the determining force of the whole organism;V i s i o n a r y S c i e n t i s t 76"

Thesensory structure also corresponds to the motor, the last degree ofwhich comprises the muscles. Naturally, these parallels are not intended to be all-inclusive. When the spiritual fluid is said to correspond to the highest aura of natureand to be counter to the law of gravity, this applies only to its organicaspect, its quality as the highest motor principle of the body, but not toits task of carrying the life of the organism, which presupposes a divineinflux. As a psychical phenomenon, animais unaware of its true great- ness, its ability to possess all the highest principles of human knowl-edge, since it is identical with its own behavior. Animacan acquire such awareness only by reflecting on the qualities of its subordinates,primarily reason. Mensseems from the very outset to be able to follow certain rational principles and to possess logical acuity, which deter-mines its way of perceiving the sensory reports transmitted by animus. But this presupposes the presence of the superior capacity that isanima. What Swedenborg achieved here is a kind of compromise between the rationalistic belief in innate ideas in man and the empiricist theory that our consciousness is entirely formed by sensory experiences. This means that, in this great controversy in contemporary philosophy also, he was striving to create a synthesis of opposing views. Aristotle wasthe father of the empirical thesis to which Locke, the radical philoso-pher of the day, gave the full support of his authority: “nihil est in in- tellectu quod non fuerit in sensibus,” nothing exists in the reason that has not previously existed in the senses.

It is significant that when he quotes Locke directly, he does so in order tofind support for his own view of anima’s function in connection with his description of our intuitive understanding of, for example, mathe-matical propositions. This is a type of insight that, according to Locke,is possessed by the angels and “the spirit of just men made perfect . . .in a future state. . . .” 76 The preface to OeconomiaI contains a passage of great interest in this connection. Swedenborg describes here two different types of re-searchers: those who are born with a capacity for observation and alust for experimentation––those like Malpighi, Leeuwenhoek, Harvey,and Winslow––and those whose strength lies in their ability to unearththe true causes of phenomena by rational analysis of the empiricalfindings of others. 77Swedenborg clearly counted himself among the latter category, which is also evidenced by what he wrote about hisworking methods as a young man. In his description of how this typeof researcher experiences a mystical vision of light when, after a pro-longed intellectual struggle, he finds a truth—how a mystical radiationpenetrates a holy temple in the brain—one is tempted to follow Mar-tin Lamm’s example and interpret it as a personal testimony, a reflec-tion of a sign such as resulted from the reading of Leeuwenhoek inAmsterdam. 78Although nothing contradicts the presumption that Swedenborg in fact was alluding here to Locke’s theory of intuition, which could provide a rational explanation of his experiences, it does not mean that Locke was the principal source of his entire psychologi-cal thinking. One should perhaps not attribute too great importance tothe statements in a rhetorical text like the preface, since they do notnecessarily represent more than Swedenborg’s characteristic way of de-scribing in mystical and dramatic terms an experience not unusual in a scholar.

Swedenborg also stated outright that he found him-self in conflict with the prevailing opinion when he placed anima above reason, but that he was compelled to do so on psychophysicalgrounds. Reason grows with the years; we can all observe this in our-selves. The newborn child has no reason at all, but acquires it through-out life by study and experience. The bodily functions proceednormally in the insane, which would not be the case if there were not asoul separate from the sick mind, an animathat determines the growth of the organism during the fetal stage when reason does not exist andthat functions regardless of the reason being diseased. 79 It is this implantation of the soul as the developmental principle of the fetus, in accordance with Leibniz’s philosophy, which served asSwedenborg’s point of departure. Locke’s argument should probablybe regarded as a decorative support borrowed from the English com-mon-sense philosophy that, as a result of Voltaire’s propaganda, was soen voguein the French environment in which Oeconomiafirst saw the light of the day; it is symptomatic that Swedenborg quotes Essay con- cerning Human Understanding in French translation. 80 If the existence of animacan thus be regarded as physiologically confirmed according to Swedenborg, its position in relation to reasonmeans that no being can form any distinct conclusions about the soulas long as he or she is living in the flesh.

As soon as they are trans-ferred to the intellect, however, they lose these delimitations. In cere-bro-physiological terms, one might say that animusis the body’s sensory center in the brain, while mensis the soul’s activity in the cere- bral cortex. Since both these functions of consciousness are situated inthe same organ, the boundaries between them will obviously be indistinct. This becomes increasingly clear as Swedenborg’s psychosomatic analysis grew more detailed during the years between the publicationof Oeconomiaand his call to interpret the Bible in 1745, primarily in the posthumously published De Anima, where he distinguishes be- tween higher and lower subfunctions in mens and animus. It is there- fore logical that, during his theosophical period, he came to simplifythe system by combining animusand mensin a common function with different levels. This gave him another advantage, namely, the fact thatthe tripartition of all existing phenomena into natural, spiritual-ratio-nal, and divine, which was beginning to emerge in the first draft of thetheory of correspondence, could be applied universally. Before the spiritual world was opened to him, Swedenborg thus worked with four degrees of consciousness, and Augustine occupiesthe place of honor among the authorities to whom he refers. 81 Swedenborg calls Augustine “illuminati judicii patrem,” a Father of the Church of enlightened judgment, and this agrees well with what he had learned from contemporary natural scientists, for example, the anatomist Winslow, to whom he so frequently refers and whom hemay possibly have met during his long stay in Paris. These allusions to Augustine are thus of dual interest: they stress Swedenborg’s general tendency to seek support from the greatest ofclassical writers, and they illustrate his affinity with the natural scien-tists of his day.

Such an influence was as- sumed by even the earliest Swedenborg commentators at the end ofthe eighteenth century, and it gained even greater currency fromLamm’s basic research in 1915, not so much in the shape of a direct in-fluence by Plotinus, but primarily through the intermediary of thescholars of the Renaissance and their followers, not least the Cam-bridge Platonists. 82 Obviously, there are many important points of agreement, but there is no evidence in Swedenborg’s large production of any penetrat-ing studies of a “mystical” natural philosophy of Renaissance–Platonictype. In reality, Swedenborg’s reading of Augustine and Leibniz, for ex-ample, explains a great deal; but first and foremost we must alwaysbear in mind the research program of 1734. The objective of this studywas to prove the immortality of the soul to the senses themselves, thatis to say, with factual arguments provided by research in the naturalsciences, which would give general validity by way of analogy in caseswhere language failed. Swedenborg’s philosophical studies, extensive as they may have been especially in the 1740s, were aimed primarily at building an onto-logical foundation for a systematic investigation of the human bodyand soul, but he never evidenced any interest in philosophy for its ownsake—on the contrary, it is clear that he looked on Descartes, for ex-ample, as a natural scientist and never discussed his epistemology. Toregard Swedenborg as a link in a philosophia perennis with its roots in the esoteric wisdom of antiquity is justifiable to a certain extent, forexample, when it comes to his presentation of the doctrine of corre-spondence, but it should not be thought that Swedenborg was basicallyinterested in theoretical philosophy: he was a pronounced philosopher of nature in the seventeenth-century sense of the term, a searcher for the secrets of nature who, with enormous industry, studied the reportsfrom anatomy classrooms, microscope benches, and observatories. The psychophysical pattern can be summarized as follows: Anima, the soul, is implanted with the father’s semen in the mother’s egg,which means historically that all human souls are descendants ofAdam, who received his soul directly from the Creator, as we knowO n t o l o g y a n d P s y c h o l o g y 81"

      "text": "from Genesis. An unfinished essay on the generative organs, intended for the Regnum Animale series, reveals that Swedenborg imagined the soul to be the innermost essence of the sperm, formed in the cerebralfountainhead of the spiritual fluid; it is enclosed in a type of corpuscles(globuli)in the sperm, the surface of which consists of the spirit of life. The function of the testicles is merely to extract this essence, which islater given its form by the epididymides. At this juncture, Swedenborgcategorically asserts that Leeuwenhoek was wrong when he believed hehad seen tiny animals or “worms” in the seminal fluid: what he actuallysaw were formations of these globuli. What is transformed is thus a product of the father’s brain, and its first deposit in the egg consists of the first cells of the brain. AlthoughSwedenborg uses the Aristotelian term punctum saliens for the first sign of life in the egg, he did not share Aristotle’s belief that the heart isthe first to enter the egg, but attributed this property to the brain. Thetransferred soul is the determining life principle of the organism andalso possesses its entire store of wisdom from the very outset. 83 Animais thus fully informed from the beginning, but mens, its first offspring in the organism, is correspondingly ignorant. Its emptypages are filled with the writing of experience throughout life.Through upbringing and living, mensproceeds from universal experi- ences to the particular and individual, and the more richly individual-ized its conceptions, the better the human being will understand his orher universals. In this way, the child’s sensory life comes closer to itssoul, which in turn tries to reciprocate, and the meeting place of the two is mens rationalis, the intellect that is humankind’s privilege. What happens then is that communications are opened between the lowersenses of the body and the highest function of its consciousness. Physiologically, Swedenborg visualized this communication as es- tablished with the help of fibers and fluids. All bodily fluids, includingthe spiritual, flow through fibers of various kinds. This means that they are influenced by the structure of the fibers. Anatomical discoveries have taught us the general properties of the fibers, but we are still de-pendent on reasoning for the details of their origin. By reasoning wefind, in the first place, that the fibers derive from the spiritual fluid V i s i o n a r y S c i e n t i s t 82"

Swedenborg’s explanation is that thespiritual fluid is able to undergo endless mutations, that it can expandand contract to adapt itself to every conceivable purpose. But when ithas been compressed to the point that it has become a sort of congealedtissue, it loses its distinctive form, which allowed it to live its life in astate of perfection and transfers to a more obscure form of existence. The smallest fiber that has developed in this way constitutes the last intermediary link between the a posteriorisensory reports and the a prioriorders from the soul. For communications via this link to pass as smoothly as possible, it is essential that there be the greatestpossible harmony between the two types of information. In the case ofsensory reporting, this means that it should correspond to the natureof the soul, which is order, knowledge, and truth. Consequently, thesensory reports which are best received are those that follow scientificprinciples—order, knowledge, and truth. When such reports are re-ceived, the innermost fibers expand so that they almost regain theiroriginal fluid state, though not entirely, since that would break the del-icate communication. 84 In Swedenborg’s mind, these scientific principles clearly comprised a sort of classification system, in which individual events are placed intheir correct universal categories. The fibers must, therefore, be soformed as to allow for such classification, and this must mean that thechild’s upbringing is of extreme importance, as already hinted at in De Infinitoand related draft manuscripts. He does not actually say so, but it is reasonable to suspect that he believed that children should be givenan understanding of the theory of series and degrees, which he envis-aged as the most perfect classification system, nature’s own method ofsubordination and coordination. A good example of Swedenborg’shabit of including trivial observations in important contexts is pro- vided by his interpretation of the young child’s desire for knowledge. He claims that if the individual finds learning a pleasurable activitiy, hislevel of vitality will be raised and the passage of information through the fibers will thereby be facilitated.

In De Cultu et Amore Dei(1745), he expresses this thesis in charming idylls that de- scribe and interpret the learning games of the young Adam.85 The fiber system that grew out of fluidum spirituosum could obvi- ously not be entirely uniform. If it were, the organism would only be able to experience a monotonous continuum, since the spiritual fluid is a uniform force in itself. Instead, what is required is a harmoniousvariation between the fibers, which gives rise to different effects of thesame force, according to the conditions of reception. We know fromanatomy that the fibers of the brain are softer and more fluid thanthose of the rest of the body and thus allow for much greater changesin position. The ability to think is also, in Swedenborg’s view, locatedin that part of the brain that is most capable of expansion and con-traction, namely, the frontal lobe: in choosing this location, he un-doubtedly was inspired by one of his most important anatomicalsources, Neurographia universalis (1683) by the Frenchman Raymond Vieussens. 86In this way, the spiritual fluid is able to exert an influence corresponding to the receptivity of the fibers; and it is this form of col-laboration between soul and body that constitutes harmonia consta- bilita, the harmony that gradually develops in man. 87 Clearly the step from this continuous psychophysical flow to its macrocosmic counterpart in the shape of an influx of divine life in theuniverse was not too great for an ardent reader of anatomical andphysiological works, who in addition had been convinced from theoutset that existence is a system of analogies, to quote from one of theDaedalusessays. 88One should not without good reason cross the anatomical river to fetch Neo-Platonic water. Furthermore, the term harmonia constabilita recalls Leibniz, the second basic influence in this connection.

In the first place, Swedenborg said hedoubted that humankind in that case would have submitted to theconditions of the natural process of birth or of death. If our knowl-edge were so complete that we could ourselves determine our basicconditions, the effect could have been either that no race would everhave emerged or that the universe would soon have become over -populated. 89Today, when conditions of the kind imagined by Swedenborg appear to be within the reach of biological and medicalresearch, his second alternative is well on the way to becoming areality. In the second place, language could scarcely have developed, since the exchange of thoughts would have been completely organized fromthe very beginning and no outer means of communication would havebeen needed; thus Swedenborg in Arcana Coelestia imagined that the first human beings possessed a telepathic gift like the angels. Third, the soul would soon strive to be greater than God himself, and this wouldbe the most horrible of all. Such a sin could never be forgiven, since it would originate in the nucleus of the soul and not from an unenlight-ened intelligence: there would be no room for mercy.

All this corresponds closely with the notion of the world ex- pressed by Leibniz in various essays, for example, in the widespreadtheodicy of the beginning of the eighteenth century: Swedenborgstudied this carefully in the Latin translation of 1739. Innumerableindividuals all have their given task to make the whole a perfect har-mony, even if our imperfect reason cannot apprehend this in the indi-vidual case. And how could we do this, when each unit, each monadin Leibniz’s terminology, in the last analysis represents one of God’sviews of his creation? God in his infinite wisdom and perfection re-garded this creation from an infinite number of aspects, and eachsuch aspect results in a specific monad. One monad can never beidentical with another, according to the axiom that Leibniz calledprincipium identitatis indiscernibilium , the law that indistinguishable things are identical. Thereby an indefinite number of individual unitsdevelop, which God has predestined to perfect harmony and whichreflect his own being. 90This notion of individuality, which is one of Leibniz’s many normative gifts to Romanticism, was embraced bySwedenborg, even though he did not in Oeconomiaappear to have perceived its full import. The fall of man also occupies its inevitable position in this harmo- nious system, and one is reminded of the old liturgical formula “O felixculpa” (Oh, happy guilt). It was eternally presaged though not prede-termined by God, since God obviously could never positively wish for evil. Sin is the fruit of free will, and this will power was an absolute prerequisite if God were to be able to grant redemption. In this diffi-cult theological question, Swedenborg combined Malebranche andLeibniz, the former in the notion of a redeeming God as the highest ofall divine concepts and of the glory of God as the ultimate end of existence, the latter in his vision of a congregation of souls as themani festation of the glory of the Lord. Life on earth is a seminary to prepare God’s people for this congregation.

In his thinking about redemption, a person’s actionsplay a greater part than in orthodox Christianity; and the Lutheran be-lief in redemption through faith alone (sole fide)was repellent to him. This is both a logical result of his early belief in the importance of thebrain’s being formed in the right way and an indication that his reli-gious upbringing by his father had made its mark: Jesper Swedbergwas a stubborn opponent of solifidianism. In general, it may be as-serted that in his dynamic system Swedenborg came to attributegreater importance to humanity’s active will for redemption than didLeibniz in his more rigid and more optimistic structure of harmony. On the other hand, this is to a great extent a question of presenta- tion and of points of departure. This is clearly revealed in one sectionof De Anima, Swedenborg’s unfinished attempt to produce a counter- part to Wolff’s Psychologia rationalis. Here, for the first time, Sweden- borg applied the notion of correspondence on a large scale to theproblem of the connection between soul and body; we have alreadyseen that Leibniz used the French corréspondance in a similar con- text. 91But by his Latin term correspondentia , Swedenborg meant something more technical and concrete. He worked with two types ofcorrespondence, a natural agreement between, for example, musicalharmonies and our feeling of pleasure when we listen to them—hisearly notion of the harmonious relations between the vibrations ofstrings and the sensory membranes is still valid—and an acquired cor-respondence, a correspondentia acquisita, by which is meant the har- mony between, for example, the spoken word and ideas.

Since the harmony in animapredates the second, Swedenborg is prepared to speak purely chronologically of a harmonia praestabilitain humanity; but this can never be realized as long as we live in our body, for reason and soul never achieve full harmony dur-ing mortal life. However, with the help of his notion of correspondence, Sweden- borg was able to reach agreement in principle between his own viewsand those of Leibniz and Wolff, and he also believed that the most pro-found meanings of the other hypotheses of psychosomatic interaction,influxus physicus andcausae occasionales, could be embraced in the same notion. This would provide a way out of the deadlock, whichSwedenborg regarded as primarily a battle of words. His argument is afine example of his struggle for synthesis; the fact that at this stage itresulted in a model closely related to the Leibniz–Wolff intellectualstructure is important and irrefutable. 92 The Doctrine of Forms The theory of correspondence is the most important of the doctrinesthat Swedenborg believed would enable him to carry out the researchprogram of 1734: to prove the immortality of the soul to the sensesthemselves, to establish a psychological science based on natural sci-ence. But it is not the only one, and Swedenborg’s theory of form, hisdoctrina formarum , deserves comment before we examine in detail the origin and meaning of the theory of correspondence. It was firstdeveloped in the treatise on the fibers of the body, which was in- tended as transaction III in the Oeconomiaseries but was never completed. 93 The point of departure was one of Swedenborg’s many attempts to combine anatomy and ontology, and the motive was his desire to de-termine the form of motion that characterizes the simple fibers of thebody. The anatomical evidence derives from Leeuwenhoek, whose views on the form of the blood vessels and the nerve fibers, circular orspiral as in a shell, Swedenborg found especially interesting.

The lowest form is the angular, which is bound by straight lines with no common center. It is found in nature in the primitive poly-gons, which are the principles of salts and which influence our sense oftaste and smell. The next form is the circular or spherical, which is theprincipal form of material motion. The third form is the spiral, or, to be consistent in terminology, the perpetuo-circular. For an element of infinity is added here in compar-ison with the immediately preceding form, which in this case meansthat the focus of these forms constitutes a spherical center correspond-ing to the position of the earth in the atmosphere. This third stage of form comprises the active forces, and we have already reached so high that words or figures can no longer provide anadequate description. Obviously, it becomes even more impossiblewhen we arrive at the perpetuo-spiral, the form of vortical motion. Inthis connection, Swedenborg explicitly expresses his acceptance ofDescartes’s theory of vortices, even though he admits that it has beenabandoned by several modern authors. He regarded this vortical formas the higher form of the active forces, that is, the form of the conatus within the active forces; he thereby tried to accommodate the notionof conatus, so important in Wolff’s works, to the scale of forms, and we shall soon find it again in the various presentations of the correspon-dence theory. As in the theory of series and degrees, Swedenborg stresses that each form contains a repraesentatio—this is Wolff’s terminology; and, true to his synthetical ambition, Swedenborg also refers to exemplar, the term of the ancients—of all the lower forms, hence a reflection orimage of the succeeding ones. The higher one comes on the scale, themore rich in meaning the forms will be. Immediately above the vorti-cal form, we find the perpetuo-vortical, also called the celestial form. This is the natural principle of the active forces and is the highest of allnature’s forms. Swedenborg regarded it as identical with what Plato inO n t o l o g y a n d P s y c h o l o g y 89"

But the ladder is still not complete. At the top, there is the per- petuo-celestial or spiritual form, which too can be perpetuated to thesupreme stage, the Divine. The spiritual form can obviously not be de-scribed in words, but it seems that, in Swedenborg’s imagination, italso represented a broad spectrum from the highest abstraction downto the borderline of the form immediately below it. Its primary func-tion is to communicate the Divine to human souls, a task it has incommon with the Word of the Lord. 94 In his description of the Jacob’s ladder of forms, Swedenborg worked from physics, but there are also corresponding forms of vitalcharacter, biological and psychological. The construction was carriedout analytically, but Swedenborg also attempted to observe his formscale from the synthetical angle—he often uses the terms analysisand synthesisin the same sense as Newton, to differentiate between induc- tive and deductive reasoning, and he constantly stresses that the ana-lytical approach is the only one open to humankind since the Fall. From the synthetical perspective, the form scale appears to em- anate from the Divine, but this does not mean that the Creator is re-sponsible for the existence of imperfections and deficiencies at thelower levels of the scale. What has happened is that the nature of anoriginally perfect form has undergone a change. This is a fate that canonly befall the vital forms, which have been accorded freedom of ac-tion, namely, angels and human minds; but it may produce secondary effects, a transformation of the elements of nature—the Apostle Paul teaches us that the whole creation has been groaning in travail together(Rom. 8:22). Such essential transformations are tragic consequences of human evil, but they are by no means unique.

The power of accidental changes is an integral part of the perfec- tion of the higher forms and enables them to create new substancesthat are given the closest lower form. Swedenborg uses an example atan elementary level: a particle of steam consists, in part, of a combina-tion of air and ether masses, in which the ether, normally vortical,takes on the spiral form as long as it moves within the steam; as soonas the combination is dissolved, the constituent parts return to theiroriginal forms. The highest forms are thus always present in the inner-most conceivable part of the innumerable combinations, and all thattruly exists in them is the highest form of nature, the celestial or, to usehis own terminology from the theory of series and degrees, the firstsubstance. In order that all lower forms will not disintegrate, a fixedorder is required in which each and every thing occupies a given position. 95 Swedenborg’s doctrina formarum can be traced to his own spec- ulations on corpuscles and particles and to the evidence from ancientand modern metaphysics which he himself cited, but its foundation isobviously the same as for his entire system, his certainty of universalorder. What is interesting, however, is not this certainty as such—it wasshared by the majority of his contemporaries—but its individual for-mulation. Swedenborg’s ambition to reach a synthesis of old and newis striking here as in the psychophysical interaction discussions, but al-most equally apparent is the inspiration from what Swedenborg him-self in a moment of exasperation likened to obscure oracularpronouncements, the Leibniz–Wolff system. 96The scale of forms is Swedenborg’s version of the crystalline universe of the monads, theirhierarchy from the petrified life of the stone to God’s all-inclusive consciousness.O n t o l o g y a n d P s y c h o l o g y 91"

He was prepared toacquire these insights regardless of the effort it cost him, but this wasnot the basic problem.

Bearing in mind Swedenborg’s mentality, we can easily understand that he would first search for these instruments in the realm of mathe-matics.

This imaginary science he called philosophia mathematica univer- salium, a mathematical philosophy of universal concepts. Without itshelp, we might as well try to reach the moon as to dissect the soul,since it constitutes the very analysis that makes it possible for the soul(anima) to comprehend its own nature. 97The theory of series and degrees represents an attempt to formulate this philosophy. As was es-tablished in chapter 4, Swedenborg regarded this doctrine as a repre-sentation of universal order, a means of assigning phenomena to theirright categories; and it thus constituted a prerequisite for a logical andnatural means of expression. In his desire to construct a language as exact as that of mathemat- ics, Swedenborg adhered on the whole to the central ideas of the mas-ters of the seventeenth century. The hope of overcoming the drearyconsequences of the Tower of Babel through logical-mathematical ar-tificial languages is, of course, older than the seventeenth century. Itcan be traced back to the linguistic logic of Scholasticism, particularlyRaimon Lull’s Ars magna from the end of the thirteenth century, but it waxed stronger with the great mathematical advances of the 1600s.Descartes, one of the greatest mathematicians of the century, believedin principle in the possibilities of creating a universal mathematicallanguage. The newly founded Royal Society engaged in various effortsto increase the precision of language, the most interesting of which is John Wilkins’ great work A Real Character and Philosophical Language (1668). This study was the most advanced attempt ever made to achieve both a logical system of classification and an ideographic writ- ing related to the interpretation of Egyptian hieroglyphs and Chinesecharacters at the time. 98 Wilkins’s artificial philosophical language proved to be no more than a new approach and a challenge.

In this connection, he obviously proceeded from the samebasic concepts as in his monadology, namely, that the predicate is con-tained in the subject, or, as expressed in terms of the monad theory, themonad is a repraesentatio mundi, a representation of the universe. To Leibniz, definition became the principal task for all science; and, if it is true that every subject contains within itself all its possiblepredicates, definition is an attempt to make these predicates manifest.In addition to nominal definitions, which unequivocally differentiatethe defined from other things, Leibniz worked with real definitions,which describe the construction of the phenomenon defined in such away that it can be concretized: geometrical definitions belong to thiscategory, as do chemical formulas. These real definitions are a part ofwhat Leibniz called ars inveniendi, the art of invention, and play a cen- tral role in the so-called ars combinatoria , the art of coordinating concepts. Thereby we have come closer to the formalization of the language that Leibniz tried to achieve with his characteristica universalis, the spe- cific system of characters that would permit calculation with conceptsin analogy with algebra. The system of characters is a prerequisite forthe art of combination, which is dependent on the monad theory insubstance. According to it, the world is a vast system of independententities, which change their relationships to one another but remain unchanged in their essence; what is new qualitatively develops when quantitatively comprehensible elements form new combinations. The aim of philosophic analysis is to disclose the simplest basic notions,which shall not be purely intellectual constructions but shall be ab-stracted from a concrete experience of reality, to the extent possible:most of our thinking is concerned with concepts, which cannot begiven concrete form or be established with material norms, for exam-ple, God, spirit, intelligence, will, substance, force.

Leibniz’s project of a “con-ceptual algebra” assumes that simple concepts can be expressed by nu-merical symbols and thus composite concepts can be regarded asadditions of the simple ones. But he soon discovered that such simpleoperations were not adequate; it was essential, for example, that theorder of priority between the concepts themselves be determined. Henever doubted, however, that it would be theoretically possible to in-vent a mathematics of concepts, and he even believed that this hadbeen partly achieved in the Chinese system of characters—Leibniz wasone of the numerous Sinophiles of his day and entertained an exagger-ated belief in the wisdom of the Chinese. Naturally he never succeeded in achieving his dream of character- istica universalis, and modern critics have had no difficulty in provingthat there exists only a handful of branches of science in which an ex-tension of the conceptual apparatus from a few simple basic conceptsis possible: geometry and mechanics were Leibniz’s own models. 101 What is essential and what was decisive for Swedenborg, however, isthat Leibniz worked so intensively to construct a method with whichone could imitate the monad’s quality of a repraesentatio mundi, and a language that unequivocally and completely would represent the psy-chic laws as mathematics represent those of nature. There is no doubtthat the philosophia mathematica universalium , which would make possible the soul’s self-analysis—the soul that is repraesentatio mundi for Swedenborg—is a direct descendant of the Leibnizian dream. It is not difficult to detect the relationship, but what about the de- tailed genealogical connections? To begin with, we must recall thatSwedenborg was fascinated by mathematics at an early stage, the sci-ence for which he confessed “an immoderate desire” in a letter of 1711.Soon after his return from his long stay abroad in the 1710s, he pro-duced a number of small mathematical papers, one or two articles inV i s i o n a r y S c i e n t i s t 96"

Experts have pointed out that Swedenborg was well-informed in contemporary mathematics and that his knowledge of the subject was probably superior to that of his countrymen at the beginning of theeighteenth century. At the same time, even a layman can see that thetextbook contains so many arithmetical errors that it is completelyuseless for its purpose. Even more serious, he seems to have put far toogreat stress on analogies. 102On the other hand, it is probably this very tendency to regard nature as “one complex of analogies” that preparedthe way for his later attempts to construct an all-inclusive system ofmathematics. Swedenborg learned from his great masters Descartesand Leibniz the elements of analytical geometry and differential andintegral calculus, the greatest discoveries of seventeenth-century math-ematics that seemed to have revealed intoxicating approaches to infin-ity and to new worlds of symbols. In his studies of the physiology of the brain and of psychology, Swedenborg was constantly forced to work with infinitely small andephemeral materials, and he was indeed soon drawn to the brink of in-finity. It is scarcely surprising, therefore, that one often finds referencesto infinitesimal calculus in his writings between 1734 and 1745, and itis equally natural for a disciple of Descartes to refer to analytical geom-etry. In the first cerebro-physiological work, probably written in 1738,he speaks of a mathematical universal philosophy or a philosophia graduum, which will lead us to ever more profoundly hidden phenom- ena and with whose help we shall be able to see things and their seriesin almost the same way as geometry can detect what is hidden in a fig- ure through algebraic analysis. In another passage in the same text, he states that it is essential to distinguish the degrees of organic nature and their mutual order justas we regard the infinite as higher than the finite or differentials ashigher than integrals. 103In the final psychological chapter of Oecono- mia, the theory of series and degrees is considered as a vital premise for all science, but it cannot in its own terminology express anythingabove the level of ordinary things.

The most strikingexample is found in a partly extant tract on the harmony between souland body written in the beginning of the 1740s, in which Swedenborgseverely criticizes the harmonia praestabilita model. 105To this criticism he adds an assumption that Leibniz and Wolff had found decisive in-spiration in differential and integral calculus. Arguments based on thatsort of calculus and on pure analysis are inapplicable to real entities, heclaimed on this occasion. Criticism of this kind coming from Sweden-borg sounds like an exceptionally flagrant example of inconsistency,but what he wanted to say was probably a variation of his chronic ob-jection to scholars who construct theories based purely on rationalconsiderations without making sure that they correspond with the ev-idence of experience. In the introductory chapter of Principia, he stresses that geometrical and philosophical arguments must rest on asolid empirical foundation, and to these basic principles he consideredhimself to be faithful. 106 The Search for philosophia mathematica universalium It is obvious that Swedenborg was aiming at a mathematical languagefrom the very outset, but there are also ways of determining the imme-diate sources of his obscure words about a philosophia mathematica universalium. The three last propositions in the final chapter of Oe- conomiaI, which bears the Wolffian title “Introduction to Rational Psychology,” are of great interest in this connection.

Thelast two propositions are supported by a quotation from Wolff’s On- tologia, which in the original contains the following passage: “Sincemathematical knowledge of things consists of knowledge of theirquantity, and qualities have quantity, i.e., degrees, which are madecomprehensible with the help of numerals, it is clear that mathemati-cal knowledge of qualities is possible.” 107 Wolff’s proposition is clearly a direct portent of Swedenborg’s in- tentions with his theory of nature’s series and degrees, but Sweden-borg’s quotation is—as quite frequently—inaccurate. In hiscommentary, Wolff begins by giving a few examples to show that thisqualitative mathematical knowledge was already established in certaincases and mentions some of his own many textbooks as sources forsuch phenomena as the intensity of light, the gravitation of solid bod-ies in fluids, the weight and elasticity of air, all of them measurable.The problem, according to Wolff, is to discover dimensions for quali-ties in general, as well as laws governing variations of the phenomena,which can be described by curves. This presupposes an established andunequivocal understanding of the qualities. All this is summarized in the following reflections, which Sweden- borg quoted in part: Among the desiderata is a science which would deliver the general principles of the knowledge of finite things; a science from which thegeometricians might draw their measures, when desirous usefully to exercise their calculations in the mathematical knowledge of nature,exactly as they turn to Euclid’s Elementato find the principles of cal- culus.

Ah, would they put theirminds to such a task, they who in their search for glory in literarymatters are convinced that nothing remains for them than to deni-grate the efforts of others and blacken their reputations!” 108 It is not clear how Wolff envisaged this coveted discipline in detail, but his aim was clearly to construct certain universal principles for the measurement of qualities, whereby they could be defined in compre-hensive terms, along the lines of the correspondence between air pres-sure and the length of the column of mercury in a barometer. The goalof Wolff’s desideratum is nevertheless as distinct as it is lofty: theachievement of the true mathematical principles of psychology andthe philosophy of nature; or, expressed in another way, Newton’s pro-gram could be applied to the psychical universe and be expandedwithin the physical world to reveal the innermost causes of existence. Bearing in mind what we know of Swedenborg’s scientific ambi- tions ever since the 1710s, it is not surprising that he diverted hissearch for literary laurels in the direction of universal science thatWolff had pointed out to him. There is no doubt in my mind that herewe have the essential text among his sources, but it must be comple-mented by others of Wolff’s many works to which Swedenborg so fre-quently referred during the busy and restless years up to 1745. Since itmay be questionable whether Swedenborg actually studied Leibniz’suniversal language project in the original, it is important to note that itis reproduced in considerable detail in the psychological work by Wolfffrom which Swedenborg was taking extensive notes in 1734. 109 There the disciple defines the master’s concept of ars characteris- ticaas the science that explains the use of symbols to indicate things or the sensations they evoke. This science was still mainly in the develop-mental stage, according to Wolff; but, when completed, it would em-brace the universal principles of mathematics and grammar, both working with symbols. Through this art, humankind would acquiresymbols for qualities, just as algebra offers symbols for quantities.

In that function the imagined universal science is known as ars characteristica combinatoria.

With the help of the art of combination, we could also, accordingto Wolff, trace the causes of things to their source in the invisibleworld, and we could unearth hidden truths through a kind of algebraiccalculation. But before this can be done, we must establish certain in-dissoluble basic concepts in the same way as mathematics did in thenumerical unit of arithmetic—still another reminder of Swedenborg’sterminology in Oeconomia, when he tried to apply the term unitas, unit, to the simple substances of the series. Finally, this science wouldenable us to transform our present symbolical knowledge into intu-itive or direct perception of the truth. Swedenborg almost certainly read this summary at the very signif- icant point in time when he was beginning to prepare for his biologicaland psychological researches. In all likelihood, it was Wolff’s summarythat caused him to try to construct the Wolffian desideratum. This ef-fort can be found in a small manuscript, probably finished in the be-ginning of 1740, immediately after the completion of Oeconomia I. 110 The most remarkable feature of this fragment is its title, Philosophia universalium characteristica et mathematica , which reveals that the author was trying to achieve an unequivocal system of symbols without having to invent new words. The symbols would have to rep-resent concepts with absolute clarity, and Swedenborg tried the easiestapproach, namely, by using the initial letters of the Latin words in question.

Incidentally, it is in this fragment thatSwedenborg used the word correspondentia for one of the first times. He also added a few designations for quantity and connections withinthe various series. The brief fragment is difficult to understand, partly because it was broken off before Swedenborg arrived at any arithmetical operationswhich might indicate how he planned to continue. Obviously, it is akind of combination art, in which the coordination of symbols reflectthe fundamentals of Swedenborg’s interpretation of the organism andits origin, and so far it is clear that he wanted to apply what he hadlearned from Wolff to a limited area. He certainly was aware that theseproblems were still far from solution. In the last chapter of Oeconomia II, he reverts to his universal philosophy, “which shall be enabled notonly to signify higher ideas by letters proceeding in simple order, butalso to reduce them to a certain philosophical calculus, in its form andin some of its rules not unlike the analysis of infinites; for in higherideas, much more in the highest, things occur too ineffable to be repre-sented by common ideas.” 111 Here, however, there is a difference in nuance compared with ear- lier statements. In the first place, Swedenborg complains about thedifficulty of the task, which is quite understandable in view of his re- cent experiences; second, he refers not only to Wolff but also to Lockewho, in his Essay concerning Human Understanding , included a brief section on what he called semiotiké, the doctrine of signs. This reference may indicate a trend away from conceptual algebra in ab- stractuand toward speculations concerning languages already in exis- tence, thus a step in the direction of his future exegetic activity.

The last noteworthy discussion of philosophia universalium mathe- maticais also presented in a psychological context, namely, in the un- finished tract De Anima. Here Swedenborg develops an idea hinted at in Oeconomia II: that this mathematical philosophy of universal con- cepts is identical with the language of the angels—this is actually a log-ical result of the reference to Locke’s theory of intuition justmentioned. In De Anima, Swedenborg tried to make a detailed analysis of the psychic functions, divided into the principal groups defined inthe psychological chapter of Oeconomia: anima,the soul; mens,the mind; animus,the lower mind; and the sensory organs of the body. Each of these includes subfunctions—in mens, for example, imagina- tion, thought, and pure intellect. It should be noted that now, after the intensive studies that one can follow in the excerpts, Swedenborg had arrived at certain shifts inthe boundaries between the levels of consciousness in relation to thepreliminary determinations in Oeconomia. Imaginatio, imagination, is an inner and higher sense of sight, a simultaneous reproduction ofmemories of a succession of sensory reports. Cogitatio, thinking, forms new ideas from these recollections in such a way as to reactivate themathematical analogies: the recollections are compared with figures ina calculus, from which the mind creates equations through a kind ofanalysis related to infinitesimal calculus. 112These equations are treated at a higher level as simple ideas, just as entire equations in algebra can be handled as units. In Swedenborg’s imagination, types of parenthesesare apparently formed around the mental sequences; and this is un-doubtedly both a characteristic and suggestive way of expressing thesame conviction that, in his theosophical writings, caused him to at- tribute innumerable inner meanings to every word, indeed every letterin the Bible. The more complicated these equations, that is, the more ideas that form higher units, the closer we come to the sphere of pure intellect.Physiologically, this occurs as changes in the fibers and membranes of the cerebral cortex; we recall that Swedenborg had come close to theU n i v e r s a l P h i l o s o p h y a n d C o r r e s p o n d e n c e 103"

Pure intellect has thus been interposed between animaand mens according to the original design, and one of its functions is to haveaccess to the science of sciences, that is, mathesis universalium . 114The associations with Wolff’s Psychologia empirica already described be- come even more confirmed by using the term intellectus purus , which in this context represents a mental function so abstract and subtlethat it is only attracted by pure mathematics; but Swedenborg mayalso have been inspired by Malebranche’s use of the term. 115The pure intellect contains the principles of science from birth andthereby determines our entire experience of the world, but it doesnot possess either the purest intelligence or the immediate connec-tion with the Divine, both of which qualities are still reserved foranima, the soul. Obviously, Swedenborg felt a need to introduce a connecting link between the soul and the mind which would lessenthe distance between the two functions: to use his own mathematicalanalogies, one might say that he wanted to work with more preciselimits than previously. In this way, he was also able to accommodate the simple cortical substance of the smallest cerebral parts in his psychological scheme. Not the least important aspect of this observation is that the reader isreminded of the fundamental premise for Swedenborg’s psychologyand later for his experience of the spiritual world, namely, that he was constantly haunted by more or less precise ideas of the behavior of theV i s i o n a r y S c i e n t i s t 104"

A note in the Diarium Spirituale (Spiritual Diary) in August 1748 tells how he had seen the thoughts and speech of the spirits gyrating in a mannerhighly reminiscent of the convolutions that exist in the human brainbut that can never be understood by the mind, since the form of thebrain corresponds with that of the spiritual world. 116This note ex- poses Swedenborg’s special dilemma: the brain and the psyche cannotbe thoroughly analyzed without an understanding of the spiritualworld, but the form of the spiritual world is clearly incomprehensiblewithout some knowledge of the physiology of the brain. In Swedenborg’s eyes, which saw the spiritual fluid as identical with the soul without implying any materialism or subjective idealism,all ideas comprise changes of condition in the brain. Hence, since suchchanges can be understood only through a description of their forms,it is theoretically possible to capture the conceptions of the mind in acalculus, i.e., a system of universal mathematics is conceivable. Thusfar, Swedenborg maintains his old position in De Anima, and he even writes that he has made certain experiments in that direction. We havealready seen how inadequately they met the requirements for microbi-ological precision and conceptual clarity. But having said that, he introduces a new element. The tremen- dous problems involved in the work no longer seem to be worth over-coming, since the results that could be anticipated are uncertain, andthe most insignificant error in calculation could lead to innumerablemistakes. For this reason he declared, “I forbear making the attempt,and in place thereof I have desired to set forth a Key to Natural and Spiritual Arcana by way of Correspondences and Representations which more quickly and surely leads us into hidden truths. Since this doc- trine has hitherto been unknown to the world, it behooves me furtherto dwell on it.” 117With these words, Swedenborg intimated the doc- trine that made his name best known, particularly in literary contexts,namely, the theory of correspondence. Bearing in mind how this doc- trine was used by symbolist poets to justify poetry’s aspirations to ex- press truths that cannot be formulated by science, we find it indeedironic that the original theory of correspondences to such a greatU n i v e r s a l P h i l o s o p h y a n d C o r r e s p o n d e n c e 105"

Before we study the basic text of the doctrine, it is only fair to alle- viate the irony with other passages from Swedenborg. In the pure intel- lect in De Anima, Swedenborg had found a temple courtyard, where the speech of the angels resounded in the algebra of the universal phi-losophy of which he dreamed, but how could this seraphic tongue bemade intelligible to the human mind? Previously, Swedenborg reliedentirely on the artificial mathematical language of the future, but nowhe suggests other possibilities: it can be done through images such aswe see in our dreams, through parables, and through fables like thoseof the period immediately after the golden age; and it will then be thetask of the mind to interpret these representations, as the ancients in-terpreted the obscure sayings of the oracle, communicated by thePythian priestess from the Delphic tripod. 118Thereby Swedenborg himself indicated that poetry can convey knowledge inaccessiblethrough other media. The relationship between pure mathematics andthe highest form of poetry in Swedenborg’s theory of correspondenceis one of the elements of the visionary’s interpretation of life thatbrings us to our own century, and the doctrine deserves more detaileddiscussion. The Concept of Correspondence If we are to establish the import of Swedenborg’s concept of corre-spondence, the obvious source is the treatise in which he first dis- cussed it in a relatively thorough manner. This was done in anunfinished essay, probably written in 1741 or 1742, entitled A Hiero- glyphic Key to Natural and Spiritual Arcana by way of Representations and Correspondences (Clavis Hieroglyphica to quote the initial Latin words of the title). Swedenborg never published this essay, and it wasnot printed until 1784 in London in a highly inaccurate Latin version. 119 The title may sound obscure, but it reflects rather adequately the extremely complex background that Swedenborg was trying toV i s i o n a r y S c i e n t i s t 106"

The phrase “hieroglyphic key” arouses asso- ciations with the antique tradition of mysticism and magic, related tothe interpretation of ancient Egyptian writings, and thereby also to thespecial combination of poetry and graphic art that flourished duringthe Renaissance and the Baroque era, namely, emblematics. The term“natural and spiritual arcana” indicates the juxtaposition of nature andspirit and is the hallmark of Swedenborg’s scientific approach; theword arcana, secrets, alludes to his lofty ambitions. The concept “rep- resentations” belongs to rationalistic psychology and immediately re-calls the basic monadologic notion of the monad as a repraesentatio mundi; from there it is a short step to Leibniz’s speculations concern-ing an artificial language of which we have already heard. 120 The mathematical associations come very quickly to those who read this little essay with unjaundiced eyes, while the literary ones arealmost nonexistent: readers are probably at a loss to understand howso many poetical trees could sprout in such an arid desert. The frag-ment consists of twenty-one examples, in which propositions fromthree areas are compared and discussed. The domains are the natural,the spiritual-intellectual, and the divine; and the author tries todemonstrate that, by exchanging the central terms, the validity of thesepropositions can be transferred to their correspondences. The sixth example can serve as a prototype. The first proposition, which belongs to the sphere of nature, reads in translation: “From ef-fects and phenomena, a judgment is made concerning the world andnature, and from the world and nature, a conclusion is made as to ef-fects and phenomena.” This proposition, which is a description of the inductive and the deductive method or, in Swedenborg’s Newtonianterminology, analytical and synthetical, is then contrasted with the sec- ond one from the spiritual sphere: “From actions and inclinations, a judgment is made concerning man and the rational mind; and fromman and his mind, when known, a conclusion is made as to actions and inclinations.” Finally, we have the third proposition, which belongs to the spiritual life: “From works and the testimonies of love, a judg-ment is made concerning God, and from God, a conclusion is made asto his works and the testimonies of his love.” 121U n i v e r s a l P h i l o s o p h y a n d C o r r e s p o n d e n c e 107"

Here he follows a principle to which he hadadhered on many other occasions, namely, that one cannot use thesame expressions, the same words, when one moves from the inanimateto the animate or from the sphere of the senses to that of the mind. Inthis very example, he drew an analogical—or, in his words, harmo-nious—conclusion from the three propositions, which he expressed asfollows: “As the world stands in respect to man, so stand natural effectsin respect to rational actions. As man stands in respect to God, so standhuman actions in respect to divine works.” In his comments on his lineof reasoning, he suggests that we call the world M(mundus), effects E (effectus), humankind H(homo), and actions A(actiones), whereby we can formulate the analogy as M:H=E:A. He states categorically that this constitutes the first foundation of mathesis universalis and promises to demonstrate later how these terms can be combined with others andmultiplied and create an analytical equation. 122 This demonstration never materialized, but there is no doubt that Swedenborg was referring to what Wolff called ars characteristica com- binatoria; all the same criteria are present. He took a small step for- ward by pointing out that still another analogy can be drawn from thepreceding ones: “As the world is to man so man is to God.” Man isthus the proportional mean, which is a mathematical way of express-ing a belief that God’s relationship with nature can only exist throughman and that the perfection of nature depends on man’s and viceversa. Later we shall encounter more stimulating expressions of thesame thought, which is one of Swedenborg’s fundamental proposi-tions—one may ask whether anyone else ever carried the idea of hu-manity further than he did in his completely humanized spiritualworld. In the same way, the other examples in Clavis Hieroglyphica for- mulate central correspondences between a conceptual apparatus ofnatural philosophy and the terminology of the higher levels, but they have no new observations to offer.

Theessential, of course, is to produce the interchangeable key words, thetrue linguistic correspondences; and the author does append such a list to his manuscript. This is probably what he hinted at when he published for the first time his ideas of correspondence in a more spe-cific sense; the examples cited hitherto all derive from posthumouspublications. This occurs in a very interesting and, in part, surprising context, namely, in a chapter on the human kidney in Regnum Animale (The Animal Kingdom), vol. I (1744). After long physiological dis-cussions based on reports from his scientific authorities, Swedenborgstresses that humankind undergoes constant regenerative processesin body and soul, in the same way as the blood is cleaned and rejuve-nated during its circulation. Thus, the spiritual life is always repre-sented in the corporeal, which is the import of the words concerningsearching of “the reins and the hearts” in the Revelation of St. John(2:23). These words were written by Swedenborg’s most exalted predeces- sor, who described what had been revealed to him in visions, in thesame manner as the Lord was to command Swedenborg to do in a verynear future. It is not unusual for him to seek support from the Scrip-tures in his scientific works; on the contrary, this happened quite fre-quently and is in line with the research program outlined in 1734.However, the situation was quite different at this juncture, which isparticularly evident from the commentary; being a crucial text, it de-serves to be reproduced at length: In our Doctrine of Representations and Correspondences, we shall treat of both these symbolical and typical representations, and ofthe astonishing things which occur, I will not say in the living body only, but throughout nature, and which correspond so entirely tosupreme and spiritual things, that one would swear that the physi-cal world was purely symbolical of the spiritual world: insomuchthat if we choose to express any natural truth in physical and definite vocal terms, and to convert these terms only into theU n i v e r s a l P h i l o s o p h y a n d C o r r e s p o n d e n c e 109"

I intend hereafter tocommunicate a number of examples of such correspondences, to-gether with a vocabulary containing the terms of spiritual things,as well as of the physical things for which they are to be substi-tuted. This symbolism pervades the living body; and I have chosensimply to indicate it here, for the purpose of pointing out the spir-itual meaning of searching the reins . 123 This is still another example of how Swedenborg promises great things, sends up trial rockets for his readers from rather shaky launch- ing pads; as far as we can judge, he had not yet had time to completemore of the preliminary research than is found in Clavis Hieroglyphica and in the relatively extensive grouping of biblical texts under variouscorrespondence headings found in the collection of excerpts, cod.36–110, to which we shall return later. What is important, however, is that he now promised a corre- spondence dictionary, which would seem to indicate that he hadabandoned the idea of trying to construct a universal mathematicalsystem of symbols. When he wrote his draft of this system, one of thearguments in favor of the selection of symbols was that there would be no need to write great dictionaries, even though at that time newly created words would be involved, which obviouslywould make the project even more difficult, as Wilkins’s universallinguistic plan clearly illustrates. Regnum Animale also contains re- markably few traces of the necessity for a philosophia mathematica universalium stressed so frequently in earlier works. Instead, the cor- respondence theory now really worked as the alternative conceivedby the author in De Anima : transpositions of letters of the ordinary alphabet would be adequate, which means that the way had beencleared for a biblical interpretation that necessarily proceeds fromactual texts.V i s i o n a r y S c i e n t i s t 110"

These beings, unlike humanones, were created with their minds fully developed, and since theyare spirits, they are superior to nature. Nevertheless, they knoweverything about natural things, which must mean that there is acorrespondence and harmony between spiritual and natural thingsand that, consequently, there is nothing in nature that is not animage of a spiritual prototype, an idea. It should be stressed that thistheory of spirits was considerably revised during the theosophicalstage with regard both to the creation of spirits and to their compre-hension of nature, which gives the system a completely different log-ical consistency than in this outline, which most closely resembles akind of vague Platonism. The goal of Swedenborg’s reasoning, however, is to arrive at the ancient Egyptian wisdom which, he believed, embraced a similar the-ory of correspondence: these correspondentiae were designated with “hieroglyphic characters” of different kinds, which could express notonly natural phenomena but at the same time spiritual things. His ref-erence for this Egyptian science is “a whole book by Aristotle,” bywhich he meant a Neo-Platonic treatise wrongly attributed to the philosopher, De secretiore parte divinae sapientiae secundum Aegyp- tios. 124That the work was not by Aristotle he discovered later, and it can scarcely have given him any major impulses, even if the title unde-niably has a Swedenborgian sound. At the same time, references to thewritings of the Egyptians recur in the entire theosophical productionin connection with Swedenborg’s description of the historical back-ground of his hermeneutics. On one occasion in the first and biggestexegetic work, Arcana Coelestia (1749–1756), he bewails the fact that the understanding of the innermost meaning of the Scriptures hadbeen lost in Europe: “It had yet been present in Chaldea, in Assyria, inU n i v e r s a l P h i l o s o p h y a n d C o r r e s p o n d e n c e 111"

      "text": "Egypt and in Arabia, and from there in Greece; in their books, em- blems and hieroglyphs there still exist such things.”125 Swedenborg makes a great many similar references to Oriental and Greek mythology, emblematics, and hieroglyphics, in his efforts toprove that his exegesis in fact revives a primitive comprehension,which the churches dissipated during the course of their tarnished his-tory. Apparently, he wanted to affiliate himself with an esoteric tradi-tion, but the references are so general that it is risky to try to determinethe sources. Ever since classical times, scholars have written of this sortof submerged wisdom, a primitive revelation that continues to survivebeneath the changing surface of faith and knowledge. Nor is the specif-ically linguistic form in which Swedenborg expressed the notion origi-nal. It is thought-provoking, though, to encounter it in the middle ofthe eighteenth century, as it is a personal reflection of the new interestin humanity’s primeval language, an interest associated with suchnames as Vico, Rousseau, and Herder, and that was to become of greatsignificance to literary Romanticism. The secret of the hieroglyphs was not definitively unveiled until 1822 by Champollion, but innumerable efforts to do so had beenmade ever since late antiquity. The mysterious and tantalizing aspectof early Egyptian writing derives mainly from the fact that, in additionto its phonetic function, it also serves an ideographic purpose: eachcharacter represents a concrete material object and also a sound thatreproduces the sound in the prototype that gave it its name (not vow-els, however, which remained undesignated as in Hebrew). The pho- netic purpose of this writing was obscure, and interpreters of bothancient and Renaissance times concentrated on the ideographic aspect, which, in addition, they observed through allegorically ground lenses:the Egyptian world of mythology was understood in the same symbol- ical and allegorical categories as the Greco-Roman. 126 When the scholars of Europe in the fifteenth century learned of the only fully extant ancient hieroglyphic treatise, Horapollo’s hand- book Hieroglyphica, the result was not only a revival of the allegorical hieroglyphic discussion, but also impulses for a new literary genre, em- blematics.

It was thus a matter of combining wordsand images to form a concrete representation of an idea, usually amoral proposition. Behind this lay a number of ideas related to Egypt:the image was a counterpart of the hieroglyphs and the text corre-sponded with obscure proverbs, known as Pythagorean maxims andpresumed to contain the most profound wisdom stemming fromEgypt; it was an old and widespread belief that both Plato andPythagoras acquired their wisdom during long years of study inEgypt. 127 In later developmental stages, the image might be left out and re- placed by other literary devices in which analogies, similes, andmetaphors were of central importance; and the concept that the pur-pose of poetry is to give symbolical shape to supreme wisdom—to be apoesis parabolica in the terminology of the day—walked hand in hand with these tendencies. But it was not only poets and painters whomade use of the special modes of expression provided by emblematics,and innumerable examples of hieroglyphic symbolism can also befound in works on theology and the philosophy of nature. Before theinvention of alphabets, humanity knew God through hieroglyphics;and what are the heavens, the earth, and all beings but hieroglyphicsand emblems of his glory, in the words of an English emblematicist in1635. 128In the same year, the associations of natural phenomena with hieroglyphics are carried out consistently in Sir Thomas Browne’sbasic contribution to the history of ideas, Religio Medici (The Physi- cian’s Religion); when as modern an author as Baudelaire coins thephrase “tout est hiéroglyphique,” all is hieroglyphic, in his important essay on Victor Hugo (1861), he expresses the same nature-symbolismidea. Emblematics was also put to use in pedagogics at a very early stage, primarily by the Jesuits; they used images and mottos in their teachingto arouse and maintain the children’s interest, and one of their mostsignificant followers in the educational dialogue of the seventeenthcentury was Amos Comenius, theologian and educator of the sect ofU n i v e r s a l P h i l o s o p h y a n d C o r r e s p o n d e n c e 113"

It is thusclear that hieroglyphic symbolism was useful in a number of differentand also conflicting ways. Mario Praz has emphasized that a contradic-tion characterizes the entire purpose of the art of emblems. On the onehand, its proponents want to create an esoteric language reserved forthe few, a poetry for a few initiates, a learned and speculative art thatcan capture what the blunt tools of science cannot grasp. On the otherhand, they want to make moral and religious propositions intelligibleto all, including children and the illiterate mob; in other words, theyadhere to the tradition of the medieval Biblia pauperum, the Bible of the poor, or of the stained glass and sculpture of the cathedrals. 129 These contradictory tendencies recur constantly, interwoven with eachother. Practically all books on emblematics refer to Horace’s utile dulci program (that is, combining profit and pleasure) to justify the methodof making moral messages intelligible and digestible, but at the sametime emphasize the noble origins of emblematics in hieroglyphic an-tiquity and interpret its symbolic language as the tongue of God andthe angels. The background just briefly summarized was certainly familiar to Swedenborg. Among his excerpts, he noted the title of the standardwork on emblematics, Picinelli’s Mundus symbolicus, in a Latin edition published in 1695; he frequently encountered hieroglyphics and em-blems in that part of his reading which we can verify. 130He also made exciting use of these terms in several of his works. In one passage of Arcana Coelestia, he states that symbols like those used in coronationswere usually called emblems because nothing was known of corre-spondences and representations; obviously, he regarded his doctrina correspondentiarum as the true idea on which all these forms of sym- bolic language were based. 131 But the bonds can be tied even more firmly and more exact sources established. The name Amos Comenius was certainly well- known to Swedenborg, and he presumably was familiar with Come-nius’ great textbook Orbis sensualism pictus (The World in Pictures) and the pansophical dreams behind it and other comparable works.V i s i o n a r y S c i e n t i s t 114"

In any case, Comenius became a reality to him when, in 1734, he excerpted Wolff’s Psychologia empirica in Leipzig. Among the quota- tions, we find several notes on the hieroglyph concept, which are ex-ceptionally interesting and directly applicable to Clavis Hieroglyphica: they yield many clues to the mystery. When Wolff analyzes the humanimagination, he also gets into what he calls hieroglyphic signs; by thishe means signs through which a thing can be attributed a significancebeyond itself. As an example he takes a triangle, which is used to desig-nate the Holy Trinity. Swedenborg noted one of Wolff’s definitions: “Ifa phantasm is so composed that by the similitude which its constituentparts bear to the intrinsic determinations of some given thing, the lat-ter can be inferred from the former, the phantasm has a hieroglyphicsignification and is composed by force of the principle of sufficientreason.” From the annotations on this and certain subsequent definitions, Swedenborg observed that “the ancients represented dogmas and his-torical matters by hieroglyphic figures. This was a familiar practicewith the Egyptians, and some say the same thing of the Chinese.Comenius exhibits the human soul hieroglyphically.” 132This reference leads directly to Orbis pictus, in which Comenius tries to illustrate the concept of soul by allowing a number of points to create a humanform—in this way, he also gives shape to the indivisibility of the soul(the points), its substantiality, its union with the body, and the quality bestowed on it by Scholasticism of being both in the whole body and in its every part (the silhouette of the body). All phantasms are naturally not so highly complex, and Wolff stresses that there are various degrees of perfection among them. Thehighest perfection results in a total correspondence between the detailsof the phantasm and the thing that it concerns, and then we have whatWolff calls a perfect hieroglyph.

According to Wolff, this was practicedby the Egyptians, but, unfortunately, we can no longer fully grasp theirmethods. He further explains that the letters of the Hebraic languagehave sometimes been believed to possess hieroglyphic significance, andhe refers to a work by one of his own teachers, the well-known theolo-gian and statistician Caspar Neumann’s Clavis Domus Heber (The Key to Eber’s House). Finally, Wolff emphasizes that we must differentiatebetween the truth that is inherent in the thing described and thatwhich lies in the hieroglyphic sign. He writes that he himself assumesthat images of deities originally were hieroglyphics and designated di-vine qualities, but that this hieroglyphic import was eventually forgot-ten so that we now are astonished that human beings could envisionsuch absurd gods. 133 This, of course, is a clear parallel with Swedenborg’s views of the original manifestation of correspondences, which later was lost andmisrepresented in various forms of idolatry until he himself was calledto revive the truth. There is no doubt that it is the hieroglyph conceptin this sense that explains the choice of words in the title Clavis Hiero- glyphica. There is nothing to suggest that Swedenborg was interested inthe Egyptian written symbols as such: instead, he concentrated exclu-sively on the insights into nature as a reflection of transcendental lifefrom which they were believed to have sprung. His reading of Wolff re-called the literary and pedagogic hieroglyphic tradition of the Renais-sance, and it is significant that he encountered this reminder in apsychological work by the contemporary scholar whom he most ad- mired at the time.

But Sweden- borg would not have been the man he was if he had not tried to createan even firmer system from his own observations. At the same time,this attempt reveals that, in his preliminary studies, he had already in-vaded more portentous domains than the natural-philosophical andpsychological ones in which the examples originated. For the tract re-sults in his setting up a number of categories of correspondences, themajority of which reach beyond the examples. There are four categories. The first is called correspondentia har- monica, and it resembles most closely the type that was exemplified inClavis. The relationship between it and the mathematical backgroundis clear, but is absent in the remaining three. By harmonious corre-spondence is meant the variant that prevails between light, intelli-gence, and wisdom; between modifications in matter, sensations, andthoughts; between visual images, ideas, and rational arguments—terms that can be compared with those in a mathematical analogy. Theattribute harmonica marks the association with the psychophysical thinking in Oeconomia, where the model of interaction, harmonia con- stabilita, was presented as the true solution of the problem of the in-tercourse between body and soul. The three other categories of correspondence, however, lead us in somewhat different directions. Instead of mathematics, they are sug-gestive of ancient hermeneutic principles and also of symbolistic theo-ries of the nature of poetry. Together they seem to comprise thetheoretical premise for the translation of the tongue of the angels, which Swedenborg in De Anima assumes can be made in our minds and will offer interpretive principles for dreams, parables, and ancientmyths. The second category is thus known as correspondentia allegorica. In the preliminary stage, it was given the attribute parabolica, the same term the Renaissance art philosophers used to characterize the kind of poetry that possessed the mysterious profundity of the hieroglyphs. 134 In Clavis, however, its use is confined to the biblical allegories; in the volume of excerpts, most of the parabolic material of the Gospels wasput under the same heading.U n i v e r s a l P h i l o s o p h y a n d C o r r e s p o n d e n c e 117"

What Swedenborg was trying to achieve is usually known as typological or figural exegesis,even though he extended the meaning beyond what is customary, thatis, an exposition which in the Old Testament identifies direct precur-sors of Christ and the New Covenant: when Abraham was prepared tosacrifice his only son Isaac as a burnt offering (Genesis 22), this was atypusor figuraof what would happen at Calvary, even in such detail that the son had to carry the wood to his own pyre. To this Judaichermeneutics, which of course has been of extraordinary significancein the history of poetry—we need only mention Dante—Swedenborgadded tales from the New Testament that prophesied the future king-dom of God and the angelic society. 135 The fourth and last group in Clavis, correspondentia fabulosa, is as- sociated directly with poetry. In this category, Swedenborg unites mythand poetry with man’s dream world, as occurs in the pure intellect ac-cording to De Anima; his high esteem for ancient mythology and po- etry as conveyers of knowledge harks back to his earliest literaryexperiences: paraphrases of Ovid can be found in some of his juvenileLatin poems. 136 Two significant propositions are laid down following these differ- ent definitions of the categories of correspondences. In the first, he de-clares that we have the right to assume that the universe is filled withtypi, presages, even if we are unaware of them in practice. The presentmoment always includes the future, and as long as the vital fluid from divine providence flows out into the world, everything consists of con- necting links (contingentia). In both his way of thinking and of ex- pressing his thoughts, Swedenborg once again adheres to Wolff. 137The second proposition states quite briefly that it is permissible to interpret the Word in this way. Here the exposition is abruptly terminated, andall that follows is a relatively summary list of corresponding concepts. The second proposition is obviously a later addendum, although it has not been observed by Swedenborg scholars; and we cannot knowwhen Swedenborg received permission to interpret the Bible accordingto his correspondence system, nor how he experienced it. 138It mightV i s i o n a r y S c i e n t i s t 118"

There are several reasons for drawing this conclusion. For example, thename of the second correspondence category was changed from theoriginal parabolica to allegorica; in this manuscript he also worked with two further groups of correspondences and representations. As already mentioned, there is a pronounced difference between the first correspondence category and the other three, but they are allregarded as applicable to the Scriptures. They were, in fact, utilized forthis in cod. 36–110; and even though it is sometimes difficult to un-derstand why a biblical passage is set in one or the other group, a pat-tern and a possibility of explaining the origin of the system arediscernible. The manuscript cod. 36–110, which is highly rewarding assource material and which is readily available in English translation,consists primarily of excerpts from psychological and metaphysicaltexts. A list on one of the first pages indicates the sources to be con-sulted: the classics are represented by Plato, Aristotle, and Augustine,while the modern names comprise Grotius, Descartes, Malebranche,Leibniz, Wolff, and two lesser lights, the German Leibnizian Bilfingerand the Swedish philosopher Andreas Rydelius. To these Swedenborgadds the Holy Scriptures, which is not surprising in view of his earlierdeclarations of intention. 140A great deal of space is devoted to the question of the interaction between soul and body. In this highly con-troversial set of problems, the notion of harmony is of central impor-tance to the scholars cited and to Swedenborg himself, but there hemay also have encountered the otherwise rare Latin term correspon- dentia. Following his long quotations from source materials, Sweden- borg jotted down in an empty space still more notes, together with hisown reflections, under a heading that is a kind of collection of mater-ial and a preliminary demarcation: Typus, Repraesentatio, Harmonia, Correspondentia.

This systematization of the Scriptures be-gins with the category correspondentia harmonica , after which the others follow at pre-established intervals. The first heading is thusclosely related to the psychological excerpts; under it, Swedenborg re-ports on texts that combine natural phenomena and psychologicalconcepts: light, day, night, water, air, blood, body, spirit, endeavor, will,love, etc. For these he seeks spiritual counterparts, which can give thetexts a meaning acceptable to him. The second and third categories he took from traditional exegesis, while the fourth, correspondentia fabulosa, mainly consists of stories of dreams and visions in the Bible. To these he adds episodes that he ex-plicitly interprets as parallels to the ancient fables, including the storiesof the creation of man, the serpent in paradise, and the Tower ofBabel. 142This interpretation is of special interest as an explanation of his daring to create his own mythic version of the birth of the firsthuman being from an egg carried by the Tree of Life in De Cultu et Amore Dei a few years later. The most likely interpretation of this first systematization of cor- respondences seems to be the following: In the course of his detailed and extensive excerpt work on metaphysical and psychological prob-lems, designed as a preliminary to the scientific works that would com-plete Oeconomia and, ultimately, the superhuman research program of 1734, Swedenborg made a thorough study of the Bible from a numberof different aspects.

That the harmony category comes first underlines the correlation between the correspondence theory and the philosophy of universalconcepts; through its analogous character it comprises “the first foun-dations of mathesis universalium.” The combination of scientific theo- rizing and biblical exegesis is not sensational in itself, but represents astep in the same direction followed by a number of Swedenborg’s mostillustrious colleagues in the previous generation: Steno, Swammerdam,Newton, Boyle, Hooke, all of whom devoted much energy to interpret-ing the Bible and, to that end, “took the trouble of learning the holytongue,” as Boyle expressed it. 143Swedenborg, it is true, had studied Hebrew as a young man, but this first systematic review of the Biblewas made in Latin translation, and several years were to pass before hebegan his study of the original texts—bearing in mind what he hadlearned from Wolff about the hieroglyphic significance of Hebrew, onecan perhaps relate his study of the language to the sphere ofphilosophia mathematica universalium. However, there was an interval of several decisive years between the tentative speculations in the volume of excerpts and Clavis Hiero- glyphicaand the conviction of a divine call in the exegetical works. The most interesting traces of these years can be found in the Journal of Dreams, and their literary fruits are discernible in one of Sweden-borg’s most original and beautiful works: the fragmentary treatise onthe creation and the first human beings, De Cultu et Amore Dei (The Worship and Love of God ), Thus, the years 1743–1745 deserve special consideration.U n i v e r s a l P h i l o s o p h y a n d C o r r e s p o n d e n c e 121"

Shortly thereafter, Swedenborg departed forThe Hague, where he was to publish the completed parts of Regnum Animale, the work in question. In the first pages of his travel diary, Swedenborg wrote briefly of the people he had met on the journey and of what he had seen oftowns and countryside. He arrived in Hamburg on August 12, 1743;during his five days there, he spent his time in the company of severalSwedish travelers of the highest social standing—his birth and profes-sion gave him access to these circles. The most flattering incident washis audience with the newly elected Crown Prince of Sweden, AdolfFrederick, who graciously permitted him to tell of his plans for publi-cation and to show reviews of earlier works. 144The experience, duly transformed, was relived in several of the dreams in the following year."

In their place came aseries of almost illegible notes on various dreams, which Swedenborgrecalled from earlier years, after which there is a kind of summary ofhis mental state. Swedenborg was puzzled about several things: his de-sire for recognition as a scientist had disappeared since he had arrivedat The Hague, as had his “taste for women . . . which has always beenmy chief passion.” 145 These are categorical statements, but they were subsequently con- tradicted in dreams from March to October 1744. In reality, his ambi-tion is revealed as his most decisive moral problem, as a terriblehindrance to what he craved, filiation to God. If it is true that the fifty-six-year-old man no longer worshiped Venus in deeds, which is ques-tionable in itself, his subconscious had nevertheless retained the mostconcrete traces of that “chief passion.” In the “wakeful ecstacies” ofwhich he speaks in addition to the normal dreams and which shouldpossibly be regarded as a kind of trance, psychologists of religion havedetected a phenomenon common in mystics, one which usually con-tains an element of sensuality. Martin Lamm has rightly stressed thatSwedenborg was not only fully aware of this connection between di-vine and mortal love, but also described it without circumlocution. 146 A review of the contents of the Journal of Dreams will reveal that both the dream work and the interpretations were to a great extent deter-mined by his scientific experiences, which as we have seen comprised studies of procreation. The first dated dream, during the night of March 24, 1744, is char- acteristic. Swedenborg thinks he is standing by a machine, which is op- erated by a wheel, whose arms grip him and lift him up so that hecannot free himself. This is a mechanical nightmare, natural to adreamer trained in engineering, to be added to the many examples ofmore conventional anxiety dreams, for example, the experience of falling into abysses and pits. Following the dream, Swedenborg sug-gests its meaning, as he regularly does in these notes: it either meant“that I ought to be kept longer in straits” or it referred to what he hadV i s i o n a r y S c i e n t i s t 124"

Hefinally decided that the dream could be interpreted in both ways. 147 Similar dreams, immediately associated with his scientific work, recurthrough the Journal of Dreams and comprise approximately one-third of the 150 dreams mentioned. The work on different sections of Regnum Animale went on during the entire dream crisis, but the intensity and attitude vary. WhenSwedenborg began to keep a detailed record of his dreams in March1744, he was in The Hague and was preparing the second part of thegreat work. The dreams that recurred practically every night revealfrantic worry concerning the completion of the work. Most striking,however, is the struggle to achieve “faith without reasoning,” a goalparticularly difficult for intellectuals but also paradoxically attractivefor them. This agony reached a climax at Easter 1744 with the firstgreat vision of Christ: Swedenborg was hurled to the floor in his cham-ber, felt his joined hands embraced by another’s hand, and at lastlooked into the face of Christ, who was smiling warmly. 148 But not even this incomprehensible grace gave the dreamer peace. He did not question the experience itself, but he was uncertain aboutthe spirits that had acted on him: were they evil forces that wanted tobring about his downfall by making him believe that he had been cho-sen by God? The pitfall of spiritual arrogance plagued him. In additionto his constantly recurring scientific ambition, he now also was ex-posed to the lure of the halo and of martyrdom, and he was scarcely helped by his decision not to make public what his nights had revealedto him. The journal remained unknown until 1859, when the royal li-brarian in Stockholm bought it from an estate and published it in a small edition. Nor did his passionate prayers to the crucified Jesus Christ give Swedenborg the peace he craved, except for brief moments. They too carried temptation; and his father, the bishop, scolded him in a subse-quent dream as one reprimands a little boy: “You are so excitable,Emanuel.” When Swedenborg analyzed this dream, he deciphered it as a warning against the cult of the cross and abandoned the idea ofT h e R e l i g i o u s C r i s i s 125"

In mid-April Swedenborg wrote that his crisis had lasted for twenty-one days; the same day he asked his friend Joakim Preis, the Swedish Minister to The Hague, to arrange for him to take commu-nion once again. The next night Swedenborg had a hideous nightmare.He saw an executioner roasting decapitated heads and throwing theminto a bottomless stove. This horrible scene is even more ghastly be-cause the executioner was a big woman, who never stopped smilingand who had a little girl at her side; Swedenborg writes that he was “atintervals in interior anxiety, and at times in a state of despair.” Atten-dance at a church service the day after renewed his distress at not beingable to silence his mind’s arguments against faith. But at last, out of his fear, sprang the longed-for “faith without rea- soning.”Pura fides, the pure faith in which the child has unquestioningconfidence, cannot be influenced by either positive or negativethoughts. The achievement of this state is not helped by theological ar-guments of the kind that had certainly troubled Swedenborg in endlessProtestant sermons, nor by attempts to prove correspondences be-tween Christianity and philosophy: this notation is the first example ofSwedenborg’s strongly negative view of the so-called natural theology,so popular at the time. What man needs is to abandon his “adorationof his own intelligence.” But no one can do this by him- or herself, par-ticularly not the learned; it is an act of grace by God. 150 What Swedenborg had now come to believe corresponds with the dream experiences, but not even at this moment of capitulation did hisscientific training cease to make itself felt in the shape of reservations: “Much of what I have experienced agrees with this, perhaps also theroasting of so many heads, which were the food of the Evil One, andtheir being thrown into a stove.” 151One might think that Swedenborg should by now have reached the stage where research no longer had any appeal; what remained to be done for one who had gained “faithwithout reasoning” except to preach this faith? What purpose wouldstill be served by his attempts “to prove the immortality of the soul to the senses themselves,” as his future research program in 1734 wasV i s i o n a r y S c i e n t i s t 126"

Only a few days after he had won his insight, he considered stoppinghis work and returning home; nothing came out of this, however. Thework on Regnum Animale was continued for a time, possibly at a faster pace, and Swedenborg appears to have convinced himself that this washis true vocation in the service of the Lord. 152 At the beginning of May 1744, Swedenborg moved to London, where he visited the church of the Moravian Brethren in Fetter Lane.As has been rightly emphasized by the latest Swedish editor of theJournal of Dreams , Lars Bergquist, Swedenborg had clearly been tempted for a time to become a member of this congregation, and it isconceivable that he actually applied for admission. However, he didnot join them—or maybe was not accepted by them—and his laterSpiritual Diary contains numerous critical attacks on the Moravians. The obscure notes on the Brethren in the Journal of Dreams neverthe- less give an indication of how Swedenborg was seeking other ways ofrealizing the Christian life, and there are signs that he had consideredtaking orders; a conversation with his father in a dream earlier in thespring can scarcely be interpreted otherwise. 153 The struggle against temptation and the lures of the devil contin- ued through the remaining months of the Journal of Dreams period, but it did not have the same anguished character as before. Sweden-borg’s inner joy was so strong, particularly when he was alone, that hecompared it with heavenly happiness on earth. It could only be threat- ened by relapses into the pursuit of worldly fame, which occurred onseveral occasions: he was especially pleased with something he had just written, he had boasted to someone about the work he was about to produce, he had listened to the deliberations of the medical faculty and hoped to hear himself cited as the foremost among anatomists. 154 But the dreams always brought him back to the right track. He was writing the third part of Regnum Animale with great confidence. In the middle of June, he dreamed of a beautiful grove of fig trees and of agreat and handsome palace overlooking the orchard. He interpretedthe palace as the plan of his work, a work directed at the spiritual,T h e R e l i g i o u s C r i s i s 127"

The same palace re- curred in a dream on the last day of September; Swedenborg consid-ered this dream to be a sign that what he had just written with God’shelp on the organic forms would permit him to achieve even moreglorious vistas. 155 This information is of the greatest interest. The section De formis organicis in genere (On the organic forms in general), constitutes a comprehensive application of the early outline of the doctrine of formto the human body, and it means that Swedenborg had revived the the-ory of series and degrees, the foundation of universal philosophy andthe theory of correspondence. Its general premise is the teleologicalnature of organisms. The reasoning starts by a proposition directlybased on the doctrine of series in Oeconomia: the organic forms of the body are perfect in relation to the degree of simplicity of the formsthat make up its units. The lung’s unit is the air receptor; the muscles’,the motor fiber; the brain’s, the brain particle and the simple fiber, etc. Swedenborg recalls the mathematical inspiration of this organic hierarchy by mentioning how arithmetical units and numerals are ap-plied in mechanics, astronomy, anatomy, and other sciences. Duringthe determinative process, the units are normally raised to the thirdpower. Here again we find the same tripartition on which the analysisof the blood was made in Oeconomiaand which occurs in the draft of the philosophia mathematica universalium in 1740. The various series of the units, like the entire organism, are united by special ties andlinks. The result is the most perfect inner coherence of the units in all the series, and these, in turn, form a corresponding pattern—thefigures are different, but they remain in the same relationship to oneanother. 156 This summary of the organic forms is Swedenborg’s last attempt to capture the laws of the biological microcosm in a mathematical model; and it is significant that, after his overwhelming spiritual expe- riences, he still feels his perspectives expanding “to even more gloriousthings” when he allows his anatomical knowledge to be arranged in categories of figures and chains of analogies. This is strong evidence of the force of his youthful vision of everything as a composite analogy,V i s i o n a r y S c i e n t i s t 128"

As reflected in the Journal of Dreams, however, this was the last time that Swedenborg felt any satisfaction with his work on Regnum Animale. His mathematical enthusiasm had disappeared a few dayslater, and from that time on, he regarded his pride in his writing as adangerous temptation: in the dream it is represented by a trek acrossthin ice toward a gaping hole. 157Instead, he turned to making plans for an entirely different book, a liber divinus, which would deal with God’s love and the right way to worship him. But Swedenborg still feltdoubt. One night he dreamed that he was lost in the fog, another timethat he had been admitted to the kingdom of innocence; he was tornbetween completing his original plan and becoming involved in thenew project, which sometimes seemed like a “toy” in comparison withthe old one. 158 But by the last notation from the night of October 26, 1744, all doubts had been overcome. Swedenborg now believed that he had re-ceived divine guidance in his new work, which would contain nothing“of the articles manufactured by others,” that is, it would not be basedon scientific source materials as the preceding studies, but, under theguidance of Christ, would be founded on what he himself thought andexperienced. The decision was confirmed in a dream recalling a child-hood memory of a market held in his father’s house in Uppsala—Swedenborg was probably about ten years of age—but also by a moreobscure phenomenon, which is frequently mentioned in the literature. When Swedenborg awoke and saw the light of day, he had a fainting fitor a “deliquium” and threw himself prostrate on the floor. He recog-nized the symptoms from a similar attack when he began Oeconomia in Amsterdam, and he had his interpretation immediately at hand. Hishead was to be cleansed and purged of anything that could prevent histhoughts from penetrating the subject to be treated. 159 Unfortunately, this marks the end of the Journal of Dreams, and we therefore no longer have the same possibility of studying the progress of the work on De Cultu et Amore Dei .

We shall soon revert to De Cultu, but first a few comments on the Journal of Dreams. Swedenborg’s mental status Since its publication almost a century and a half ago, the Journal of Dreams, a difficult and obscure notebook, together with the extensive notes on his communion with the spirits during the theosophical pe-riod in Diarium Spirituale, has been the main source for psychological and psychiatric research on Swedenborg. There is no doubt that theJournal of Dreams reflects a profound psychical crisis, but it only allows us to observe the culmination in any detail. We thus know little of theorigins, even though certain elements in the list of dreams are trace-able far into the past, in some cases to the years around 1720. As an oldman, Swedenborg explained that he had communed with the angelseven as a child and that his parents had been amazed at his gifts. 160Jes- per Swedberg, however, did not mention anything of this in his mem-oirs, which makes it difficult to put any great faith in the anecdote. Itseems rather to be an understandable adjustment of the facts to fit intoa hagiographic tradition, an attempt to view his entire life as an unin-terrupted process of illumination. But the fainting fit in Amsterdam is one landmark, even if there is some question as to the actual date on which it occurred. As is oftenthe case, Swedenborg is somewhat vague, and, judging by him, 1738 isthe earliest possible date. But he was not in Amsterdam that year, though he did visit the city on other occasions around that time, andhe returned there during the latter part of 1739, when he drew up plans for Oeconomia Regni Animalis. In all probability he meant the last-mentioned sojourn, and this signifies that the experience was re-lated to the “sign of truth” he said he possessed in his summary of thecorpuscular philosophy at the beginning of 1740. 161V i s i o n a r y S c i e n t i s t 130"

He noted in Diarium Spiritualein 1748 that, long before the spiritual world was opened to him, he had experienced a marvelous light when he wrote certain sec- tions of his scientific treatises; and we have already noted similarclaims in the preface to Oeconomia, even though they are highly inex- act. It appears to have been a matter of some variety of photism, andSwedenborg apparently gave the episodes an increasingly concrete def-inition in connection with the belief held by him and by many—per-haps most—of his contemporaries in the existence of spiritual beings.Based on Swedenborg’s accounts of his fainting fits and his respiratorymanipulations, certain psychiatric researchers have assumed that amild form of epilepsy was an ingredient in his illness. Indeed, mostspecialists tend to agree that Swedenborg was mentally disturbed after1744, even though the diagnoses vary. It is obviously impossible for the layman to take a definitive stand on the question of Swedenborg’s state of mental health, but certain re-flections may be justified. Since he was not examined when alive, thediagnoses are based entirely on impressions gained from his writingsand on more or less unreliable statements by witnesses. The latter in-clude a number of sensational claims, for example, that Swedenborghad an acute attack of insanity in London in 1744, that he sufferedfrom delusions of persecution, hurled himself to the ground in thefilthy streets, appeared naked in public, gave his money away to thepoor, etc. It is quite conceivable that the psychical crisis manifested it-self in violent forms on one occasion or another, but these sources arehardly reliable. Furthermore, an occasional violent episode can scarcely reveal much about the person’s mental state during almost three decades as a visionary. Friends and foes alike have affirmed that Swedenborg be-haved as behooved a learned elderly gentleman and that he caused nooffense except through his stories of the spiritual world, which he was occasionally pleased to relate in society. In addition, he performed his duties as the head of his family in the Swedish House of Nobles, andhis contributions on economic matters were not only taken seriously but were regarded by many of his contemporaries as highly qualified.T h e R e l i g i o u s C r i s i s 131"

Too,Kleen has had to admit that the psychosis did not prevent Swedenborgfrom developing his religious views until he was well into his eight-ies. 162This fact is obviously an essential one and also embarrassing to the advocates of the insanity theory; and it is easily verified by theworks that survived him, even though they are difficult to interpretfrom the psychiatric point of view. As Martin Lamm has pointed out, the claims of many eighteenth- century as well as modern writers that Swedenborg was mentally dis-turbed are based on much-too-broad definitions: all of Swedenborg’sreligious fantasies, all his deviations from the lukewarm normal wereregarded, a priori, as proof of insanity, and the term is thus deprived of any significance. 163The most problematic documents, of course, are his spiritual diaries and his use of these notes in the memorabiliare- counting experiences in the spiritual world in his theosophical works.The unused sections include sexual and excremental fantasies aboutpeople identified by name, which occasionally recall a writer of theeighteenth century who in other respects was his absolute antithesis,Marquis de Sade. 164 In these hideous descriptions of the hellish existence of relatives and historical personages, Kleen and many others saw all-too-clearmanifestations of paranoid obsessions, and this is certainly an under- standable attitude. On the other hand, in evaluating Swedenborg’s total personality, one should not overemphasize things that he wasgenerally wise enough to conceal in his diaries. For love is the domi-nant theme in his philosophy; hate and evil merely cast shadows on thelight. Still another aspect of the picture of Swedenborg deserves atten- tion.

There may be one exception, however: the anecdote about Swedenborg having “seen” from Gothenburg the greatfire that was raging in Stockholm, which is almost five hundred kilo-meters away. This event occurred at the end of July 1759. Swedenborgwas dining with friends; around six o’clock he grew restless, went out-of-doors and returned with the news that a fire had broken out in thesouth section of Stockholm, where his own house was located. Whenthe mail coach arrived, it brought word confirming Swedenborg’s vi-sion. Even the hypercritical Kant did not question the authenticity ofthis anecdote, which seems to presuppose some kind of second sightand which could be verified by a number of witnesses. 165The circum- stances are certainly strange, but obviously they cannot be regarded asobjective proof of Swedenborg’s visionary faculty. To those who are mainly interested in Swedenborg’s works and his literary significance, the question of his mental health is scarcely ofprimary concern, and one is tempted to regard the psychiatric discus-sion as mostly a matter of terminology. From the literary point of view,it is of little help to characterize Swedenborg as a case of paranoiachysteria or any other mental disturbance, since this in no sense ex-plains his originality—the parallels produced from medical case histo-ries are usually deplorably meager in comparison with the tremendousimaginative power and systematic intelligence of the seer.

But the religious crisiswas the psychological premise for the creation of the synthesis ofdecades of research represented by De Cultu et Amore Dei. Through his struggle with temptation, Swedenborg freed himself from the compul-sion to carry a burdensome scientific apparatus on his shoulders, andhis dream experiences gave him the courage to embark on a new liter-ary form: his visions of the kingdom of innocence were translated intoa prose poem on the creation of the universe, on the Garden of Eden,and the bliss of the first beings under God’s wing. A noble prologue introduces one of the work’s basic propositions, which is the most general exposition of the doctrina corresponden- tiarum:a network of correspondences exists between particulars and the universe as a whole. The prologue thereby sets the tone for the firstliterary application of this correspondence theory, and it illustrates theproposition by reviving an ancient notion of correspondence, the an-tique belief in four ages of the world. The first chapter goes on to de-scribe the structure of the solar system and its origin in the great egg ofthe universe, the ovum mundanum: There was, then, a time like no time, when the pregnant sun carried in his womb the gigantic brood of his own universe, and when, beingdelivered, he emitted them into the regions of air; for if they were de-livered from the sun, as a parent, it is manifest that they must haveburst forth from his fruitful womb. Nevertheless, it was impossiblethat he could carry in his burning focus, and afterwards bring forth,such heavy and inert productions, and therefore such burdens musthave been the ultimate effects of his exhalation, and of the forcesthence flowing and efficient. Hence it follows, that the sun was prim-itively overspread with effluvia excited and hatched by his real irradi- ation, and flowing together in abundance and from every directionto him, as to an asylum and only harbor of rest; and that from thosefluids, condensed in process of time, there existed a surroundingnebulous expanse, or a mass like the white of an egg, which, with thesun included in it, would resemble the GREATEGGOFTHEUNIVERSE ; also that the surface of this egg could at length derive a crust, or a kind of shell, in consequence of the rays being intercepted, and theV i s i o n a r y S c i e n t i s t 134"

The second chapter, the most comprehensive in the book, deals with Adam’s birth and upbringing; we shall linger at the birth scene,indeed an instance of poetic sensibility. Man too is born from an egg,carried by the tree of life in paradise and fertilized by the Lord himself.Swedenborg describes in detail, but with a sort of delicate reserve, howthe soul, anima,builds up its body in faithful observance of the pur- poses for which it is intended by providence: to create a microcosmcorresponding to macrocosm and thereby to link nature’s exterior withher interior. When the time came for man’s entrance into creation, acircle of angels guarded the precious birthplace: All things were now prepared; the parturient branch, according to the times of gestation, inclining itself by degrees towards the ground,at length deposited its burden commodiously on the couch spreadbeneath. The heavenly beings, clothed with a bright cloud, also stoodby, and found that nothing had been neglected, but that all thingswere prepared obsequiously by nature in conformity to their provi-sions. Hence when the months were completed, at that time so manyyears, the foetus, perfectly conscious of what was decreed, himselfbroke through the bands and bars of his enclosure, and raised him- self by his own effort into this world and its paradise, desired fromthe first moments of his life; and he immediately drew in with his nostrils and breast the air, which he saluted with a light kiss and which pressed in by its force as a new vital guest and spirit, for whichT h e R e l i g i o u s C r i s i s 135"

De Cultu et Amore Dei, n. 38 The sections on the growth to maturity of the first-born give con- crete examples of the psychological theories in De Anima. In conversa- tions with celestial tutors and his own intelligence, Adam learns of humankind’s intermediate position as the recipient of divine, as well asnatural light, and he hears of the struggle between God and the princeof the world and of the existential choice between love of God and loveof self. But the elaborate pedagogical discourse is not easy to follow,since the author sets the entire process in Adam’s own mind. A modernwriter would probably have used the device of inner monologue or some other form of the stream-of-consciousness method, but Sweden-borg constructed his psychological hierarchy with the help of dia-logues. When Adam converses with his intelligences, Swedenborg addsa footnote to the effect that this means that he is thinking. 166 Keeping track of the symbols requires great concentration on the part of the reader, who must also bear in mind the psychological sys-tem with its combination of rationalism and empiricism: the sensory reports are transformed by the soul (anima)into ideas, which are filed in their memory chambers. From these ideas, the soul then creates in-telligences which, after having shared her light and the warmth of herV i s i o n a r y S c i e n t i s t 136"

The latter are in communication with the soul and thus correspond most closely to the pure intellect as de-scribed in De Anima. The soul, in turn, is the receiving organ for the heavenly fluid, possesses all knowledge from the beginning, and is theguiding vital principle of the body. The second part of the work begins with a description of the birth of Eve, in which the egg notion recurs, this time combined with an al-lusion to the story in Genesis about her creation from one of Adam’sribs. One passage describing Eve’s growth contains variations on thethemes from the first part, at the same time as Swedenborg takes theopportunity to revive the psychophysical theories from the Oeconomia series: it is here that the dissection of the finest fibers discussed earlierare brought into the picture. 167At the end of this part, the first beings meet one another, and the young girl is led to her bridegroom by anangel. No further parts of this strange work were published by the au- thor. However, there is extant the beginning of a third part, which wasto deal with Adam’s and Eve’s life as man and wife.

Early the next morning, the young couple see a vision in the sky repre-senting “the universe with its destinies and inmost certainties.” 168 The vision takes the form of a brilliant center of light surrounded by two girdles. The first is adorned with a host of beautiful figureswhich, like Adam and Eve, recline on nuptial couches and representdifferent kinds of love. The second girdle encloses the first one in aring of fire, palpitated like a heart, and forms a cavity also reminiscent of the heart. Around these girdles is heaped a tremendous mass of in-numerable small eggs, which are in communication with the greatheart and eventually give birth to young, both human and animal.

The vision ends with the circles formingspirals, which constantly create new conical figures. Swedenborg broke off his work before he had allowed Adam to finish his interpretation of the magnificent vision, the synthesis of thesynthesis and the culmination of the series of correspondences. It isquite clear, however, that the human form represents the final goal ofthe creation, the kingdom of spirits in the shape of an all-inclusivehuman body. In an earlier draft, Swedenborg had planned a work onthe City of God for the year 1747, and the final vision in De Cultu et Amore Deiis a fragmentary realization of this project. The discussion between Adam and Eve may also give the key to the title of the book:“for APPROACHBYWORSHIPISSUCHASISCONJUNCTIONBYLOVE .”169With- out God’s love, transmitted through Jesus Christ, we could never un-derstand his truth and hence not worship him in a fitting manner. Inthe human form, the symbol of the congregation of saints, the only be-gotten Son is the head, the soul, and the mind. Swedenborg sent the third part to the printers, but stopped the work after only a few pages. It is characteristic that the interruptioncame at the point when Adam had begun to describe the details of thevision, particularly those concerning the function of the prince of theworld. It is true that the drama of Creation and the first human beingscontains a number of portents of Swedenborg’s development, at thesame time as it is a synthesis of his scientific production; but it stillrepresents only a short step along the road. The work is not regardedby Swedenborgians as one of the writings inspired by his illumination, and the explanation given is primarily that the author had not yet ar- rived at any final theological standpoint. The belief in the Messiah as the only begotten Son of God and in a personal prince of the world is dropped in the subsequent works, as isthe notion that angels and demons existed before man. In De Cultu et Amore Dei, Swedenborg reckoned with a fall in heaven, as described byMilton in Paradise Lost—the similarity is due, of course, to the com- mon biblical source.

The Son, however, threwhimself in the way of the Father’s thunderbolts and extracted apromise that the earth would be allowed to complete its allottedspan. 170But the harmonious relationship between heaven and nature had already been destroyed, and though the prince of the world stillacted as the intermediary, he did so only under compulsion. In thefinal theosophical system, the devil is exterminated and the role ofChrist is transformed. Christ becomes an incarnation of God himself,and he descends to earth to restore man’s knowledge of the Word andto correct the balance in the world of spirits, where the evil ones hadmultiplied and grown too powerful. De Cultu et Amore Dei is a late example of the kind of literature usually known as the hexaemeron genre, works describing the creationof the world in six days, but it seems impossible to associate it with anyspecific literary model. Impulses from Milton have been cited, but itcannot be proven that Swedenborg ever read Paradise Lost; the similar- ities can be explained by the common background in the Bible andclassical mythology. 171Were one to try to specify a single significant source, the first to come to mind would be Ovid, the creator of The Metamorphoses, in whose writings Swedenborg had early on encoun-tered a world of correspondences and transformational symbols. Healso had witnessed how Ovid could be used in cosmogonic contexts,for example, in Thomas Burnet’s Telluris Theoris Sacra , which gave Swedenborg the inspiration for the ovum mundanum symbolism. But the final impression is that Swedenborg achieved a profoundly per-sonal synthesis of his scientific studies and his religious beliefs, anoriginal tapestry of thoughts and impressions that had been in his mind ever since his youth, accomplished under the pressure of theforces of imagination liberated by his religious crisis.

We know this because he told several friends about itin his old age. 173The vision was presumably in the form of a manifes- tation of the Lord God himself and was a call to explain the spiritualmeaning of the Word to humankind. Swedenborg obeyed the com-mand; obviously, this did not imply any sudden or radical re-orienta-tion. For the few years following 1745, he was absorbed in systematicBible studies. These resulted both in extensive indices and other ex-cerpts and in a number of attempts to base on them a presentation oftheir spiritual significance. Understandably, the first effort is devoted to the book of Genesis, and this led him to evaluate his last profane work in the light of hisnew experiences. The outcome surprised him: the conformity wasgreater than he had anticipated. It should be noted, however, thatSwedenborg only named the origin of the world, paradise, and the cre-ation of Adam as points of comparison. Admittedly, Adam’s birth froman egg in De Cultu et Amore Dei should have presented a hurdle, but Swedenborg appears to adhere to the views he expressed there; heleaves it to the reader to decide which version of Genesis he prefers, theliteral or the interpretative. 174However, this Historia Creationis was in- terrupted after the third chapter of Genesis, and Swedenborg began allover again with other interpretations. These are aimed at determining what the Bible has to say about the kingdom of God. 175Once more we are reminded of the working plan for 1747, De Civitate Dei, (On the City of God). To realize this plan, Swedenborg contemplated following typological and symbolical ap- proaches. The purpose of the creation was to establish a society of saints to the greater glory of God, ad majorem Dei Gloriam, and noth- ing exists in this world that does not, to the best of its ability, represent this ultimate purpose. The description in Genesis of the emergence ofthe earth from chaos and of the progress of the days of creation thussummarizes in symbolic terms the fate of the universe and ofmankind.

With his enormous energy, Swedenborg was able to carry out a great part of his program. Many thousands of pages of his manuscript,divided into categories, are still extant, and most of them have beenpublished by devoted disciples long after the master’s death. For abouttwo years, however, he appears to have worked only with Latin transla-tions of the Bible; he apparently did not embark on a study of the orig-inal Hebrew text until the beginning of 1747. He conducted the greater part of his biblical researches in Sweden after his return in the summer of 1745, concurrently with his work atthe Board of Mines. There are no signs that anyone objected to the as-sessor’s new preoccupation, assuming that it was known. Nor was itsensational in itself, bearing in mind the activities in their old age ofsuch illustrious men as Newton. In fact, Swedenborg was recom-mended for promotion to a position as councillor on the Board. In-stead, he chose to submit his resignation in order to have more timefor his studies. In his letter of resignation, however, he merely wrotethat he was engaged on “an important work.” He declined any promo-tion, but requested that he be permitted to retain half his salary. His re-quest was granted in the summer of 1747, and the pensioner onceagain departed for Holland and England. 176 There is no need to dwell at length on these years of preparation. Swedenborg maintained the same general working habits that he fol-lowed when he wrote his scientific treatises, but the sources had beenreduced. He was no longer a solitary seeker for the truth about nature and for a language that could express his discoveries with mathemati- cal precision. Now he shared the knowledge of the spirits, was in daily communion with them, and had his views confirmed by them. Thisdoes not mean that he had reached absolute certainty on all questions.On the contrary, one finds many examples in his Spiritual Diary of what he regards as attempts by evil spirits to lead him astray and intotemptation. But he possessed the certainty of his call, and this trans-formed the lost and anguished seeker into a peer of the prophets.

Many were able to accept his exegesis and the rationalisticfoundations of his theology, but regarded his reports from the world ofspirits as embarrassing proof of his aberration. Others were repelled byhis view of the Bible and of God and urged him to write only aboutwhat he had seen and heard in the world of spirits: this was the case of his first disciple in Germany, the controversial prelate F.C.

With Swedenborg there is no question of stray and disconnected experi-ences, but rather of an overly systematized pneumatology. Evidence isthereby provided of the need for and practicability of research in hisspiritual world—few literary landscapes can have been mapped withgreater care and thought. The great difference between the Journal of Dreams and the subse- quent reports on the spiritual landscape is that, in the latter, Sweden-borg relates the doings and sayings of the spirits as if they wereordinary everyday phenomena. The hesitations and doubts of the Jour- nal of Dreams are almost entirely gone. There he is often uncertain how the symbolical dreams should be interpreted and finds it neces-sary to write down his efforts to decipher them, but in Diarium Spiri- tuale we encounter the most factual and down-to-earth accounts. Paradoxically enough, the latter diary makes a more “scientific” im-pression, in part because the author frequently produces the most de-tailed physiological and psychological frames of reference, into whichthe language of the spirits, divine light, and celestial heat can be fitted. A relatively insignificant expansion of the psychophysiological concepts of the Oeconomia series actually sufficed for Swedenborg to be able to explain in rational terms his experiences of the presence ofthe spirits. When in Arcana Coelestia he speaks of his “inner vision,” which permits him to see supernatural things more clearly than every-day ones, he is obviously thinking of the inner eye of the soul (anima).All perception ultimately depends on animaas the vital principle of the body; but for information on the material world the soul dependson the organs of perception, the external ones in the eyes, ears, and skin and the internal ones in the cerebral cortex. When the body dies, animais naturally freed from its boundaries and all that remains is its own vision. This inner vision, however, is bestowed on certain favored beings, for example, the prophets, during their lifetime. Swedenborg uses theterm “representative vision” for these cases, and he thereby emphasizesthe connection between this and the normal intellectual process.

Lamm believed hecould identify the two varieties of vision as pseudohallucinatory andpsychosensorial visions, respectively, but other researchers do notagree on this point; a number of intermediate forms can probably beassumed. Swedenborg himself, however, wanted to distinguish be-tween his daily exchanges with spirits and his very rare experiences of the other kind; it is, of course, his view that is important in this context. 178 A great part of the spiritual diary is devoted to discussions of the language of the spirits. Normally, Swedenborg clearly comprehendedtheir speech with his “inner hearing” whose function corresponds tothat of the inner vision; he analyzed it with the help of the tremulationmodel he had developed back in the 1710s. He frequently affirmed,most categorically in De Anima, that thought is a kind of inner speech, and this theory is justified by what happens in the material substratumof thought. From that point of view, thought comprises changes ofconditions in the brain, which produce undulatory movements in thespiritual fluid; and these, in turn, bring about movements in the or-gans of speech, which result in corresponding tremulations in the air,that is, sounds. When Swedenborg became aware of the spirits’ speech,a similar process was set in motion but without any external influence.The speech of an angel or a spirit influences thought and then acts onthe hearing organs from within, according to De Coelo(Heaven and Hell, 1758). 179Consequently, the sound of this speech is as distinct as that of a human being, even though it can only be heard by one who has been exposed to this inner influence. This physiological model can also be combined with the doctrine of forms in order to define how the influence can be brought about,and here we have an exceptionally good illustration of Swedenborg’s talent for coordinating his pneumatic experiences with the metaphysi-cal system he had already developed, which, conversely, had served as a preparation for such experiences.

It also explains the relations between thespeech of the spirits and a person’s normal tongue. The speech of thespirits is universal; hence, it corresponds with every individual mortaltongue, since all words have an inner significance corresponding to thecelestial form. A basic concept that recurs constantly in Diarium Spiri- tuale is that each one of our everyday words can have thousands of inner counterparts. Swedenborg justifies this idea in characteristicfashion by pointing out how tremendously the microscopists ex-panded our knowledge when their vision was intensified by groundlenses; an equally unbelievable expansion will be the result of the the-ory of correspondence. 181 By comparing words and thought with the doctrine of forms ap- plied psychophysiologically, Swedenborg arrived at the conclusion thatlanguage in the world of spirits is an inner speech and that the spiritsthus communicate through direct transference of thoughts. This is alsothe way in which he imagined the conversations between the firsthuman beings and the spirits before the relationship was broken by thefall of man. When spirits now converse with living beings, the recipi-ents comprehend what is said in their own language; the explanation isthat the words have a universal inner significance, which is all that thespirits can understand, while human beings can and must transpose itto their own particular level. Certain traces of these universal mean-ings can be found in our normal speech, for example, when we usevarious kinds of images—videre, see, for understand, grasp, etc. 182 In Diarium Spirituale, Swedenborg is greatly concerned with not- ing and analyzing his experiences of the speech of the spirits, but sinceit was written parallel with intensive studies of the Old Testament, it isnot surprising that the problem of written language is also discussed.The more familiar he became with Hebrew, the more he tended to putthe language of the Word in a special class.

In ancient times, according to Swedenborg, this correspon-dence was total, but in later Hebrew writing, it applied only to thesoftly rounded characters. 183 Conceivably Swedenborg was inspired to some extent by Caspar Neumann, the theologian referred to by Wolff, who presented a the-ory on the hieroglyphic nature of written Hebrew at the beginning ofthe eighteenth century. Ever since ancient times, Hebrew philologistshave called the elements of letters jodimand have regarded them as combined by different variations of the character j odh. Neumann considered that jodhis the sign of extension and, on the basis of his Cartesian conviction, he explained that extension is an attribute ofthe material bodies. Consequently, the Hebrew characters representimagines rerum corporearum , images of material things. Neumann also stressed that the Hebrew system of writing vowels separatelycorresponds with the absolute separation of soul from body, “discov-ered” by Descartes. 184 There is no question that Swedenborg’s view of the correspon- dence between Hebrew writing and the celestial form produced thesame effect as Neumann’s, and his view of the special position of thevowels is also the same. In Arcana Coelestia, Swedenborg carried out a preliminary classification of the meanings of words according to thevowel frequency in Hebrew. The first three vowels are usually found inwords belonging to the spiritual class, while the last two are generallypresent in words of the heavenly class. In this way, he arrived at a hermeneutic principle that worked mechanically, and this must have been particularly important when he was faced with translating the enormous volume of personal and place names in the books of Moses. The same classification recurs in somewhat different form in De Coelo, when he describes the speech of the angels and spirits. In the case ofspiritual angels, words are related to Eand I, while the speech of heav- enly angels resound in more powerful harmonies with the help of O andU. Their intervention in the speech of humans is also determined by this distinction, which thus allowed Swedenborg quickly to identifyhis interlocutors. 185T h e S e c r e t s o f H e a v e n 147"

It is clear, however, that they were determined by the meta-physical frame of reference from his scientific stage. In the same way asinnumerable muscles and fibers respond to a simple action, host of an-gels and spirits correspond to every thought, according to an earlyentry in Diarium Spirituale. 186The doctrine of forms expressed in the Oeconomia series is applicable in both cases, and, in the most profound sense, the communication of the spirits is a counterpart of the univer-sal language, which he tried so desperately to grasp during his last sci-entific years. With the entrance into the circle of spirits, he no longerfelt the need to construct such a language artificially. For it is there,concealed within each word; and an interpretation of the Holy Scrip-tures in accordance with the doctrina correspondentiarum provides hu- manity with an adequate understanding of the language that was ouroriginal tongue. The links with the past are thus very clear, and they are not con- cealed by the concrete linguistic problems that force themselves on theexegete. Hebrew is given a place of honor because its writing has a hi-eroglyphic import, at least to some degree, but it is never regarded as aparticularly holy language or as the heavenly tongue. Swedenborg wasnot attracted by the Kabbalah, and we find none of Boehme’s linguisticmysticism in his writings. He was and continued to be marked by his“immoderate desire” for mathematics, and the beauty possessed by hisspiritual world is universal and hierarchic but not individual. Herderonce complained that all the great historical personalities whomSwedenborg encountered in the spiritual world spoke in the same way,i.e., like Swedenborg himself. 187This is a legitimate criticism, particu- larly on the part of a man who considered the individual personality tobe of supreme importance. Swedenborg, however, did not belong among the romantics but among the rationalists, among the worship- pers of geometry and mechanics. Naturally, this does not mean that many of Swedenborg’s memo- rabilia are not of high literary standard; nor that more recent roman- tics than Herder were fascinated by his thoroughly symbolic view ofV i s i o n a r y S c i e n t i s t 148"

A system with such pretensions to totality as Swedenborg’s must inevitably con-tain incompatible elements, not to say direct contradictions, and this isparticularly applicable to supernatural conceptions. He affirms timeand again what he has seen and heard, but a comparison of theunedited notes in Diarium Spirituale with the well-disposed and well- founded memorabilia in the published works reveals a striking differ-ence; there can be no doubt that he worked hard to achieve a literaryeffect that is completely lacking in the raw material. These efforts naturally provide an explanation for some obscure passages. With respect to the speech of the angels, it is frequently statedthat their intercommunication represented direct thought transferencewithout any outside medium, something that also applied to the com-munications between the first human beings and the spirits. In thememorabilia, Swedenborg frequently has the angels speak with oneanother in a human tongue, and he even is permitted to read letterswritten in Hebrew and Latin characters in the world of spirits. 188The diary contains examples of “spiritual language words,” which do not exist in any human language and in which each sound represents a whole concept; words of this kind were never mentioned in the published writings. 189 The reader also frequently loses his or her bearings in the celestial topography, particularly if one is not sure at which level of ambitionone finds oneself. It is impossible with the space available to analyze indetail the evolution from the somewhat hesitant, unadorned narrative style of Arcana Coelestia to the final artistic confidence of De Amore Conjugiali (Conjugial Love, 1768), which was perhaps Swedenborg’s greatest work; but we can study a few typical examples. The Structure of the Spiritual World The first published stories of the world of spirits explain logically andinstructively enough how the soul is released from the body at the verymoment of death.

      "text": "situation, obviously close to the “near death-experiences” which have garnered much attention in recent years.190Two celestial angels occupy the heart, and two others sit by the head. A person’s thoughts are pre-served and guided by the angels at the moment of death, and they staywith the soul until it has reached the shore of eternal life, normally inthe form of the world of spirits, in which the choice of final abode ismade. When the celestial angels depart after completing their task,they are replaced by spiritual angels, who open the inner eye of thesoul. Until that point, the soul has only been able to experience its lib-eration intellectually, but now it can perceive it sensuously. At this point, the liberated soul may itself seek associations with the spirits. For it is a basic element in Swedenborg’s conception of eter-nal life that every spirit gravitates toward the circle of spirits that shareits thoughts and feelings as they were formed during its mortal life: asalready suggested, this is one reason that Swedenborg attributed suchimportance to the right indoctrination. Naturally, this is a question ofinnermost thoughts and inclinations. A person’s masks are droppedwhen he or she is faced with the divine light, and the exposure occursin the most effective manner: the spirit in question is unable to remainwith others than its peers; all others trouble it by their very presence. When the spirit has found its right abode, it lives for a time a life that is in full agreement with its life on earth. This is possible throughthe doctrine of correspondence, which allows the spiritual territory tobe an exact counterpart of the terrestrial. The agreement is so com-plete that many “newly dead” do not discover for a long time that theyhave departed their mortal life, but eventually they begin their new life from this intermediary stage. Swedenborg speaks unreservedly of“time” in these narratives; but as appears from his concurrent biblicalinterpretation, he does not regard it as a time concept but as a condi-tion. The same applies to space and its changes, but he must, like theBible itself, speak to humans after the manner of humans. For the truly evil spirits, the road from the interim world leads to hell, while those who lived in any degree of faith in the Lord are led toheaven by degrees. It is scarcely necessary to add that Swedenborg provides no exclusively Christian definition of these faithful ones. TheV i s i o n a r y S c i e n t i s t 150"

Their worldly misconceptions of heaven and celestialjoy are thoroughly revised. It is not a matter of ruling others from ahigh place. Heaven is not a solemn ceremonial hall into which a feware admitted; nor does it consist of a life of ease or of constant praisingand celebrating the Lord. Neither is one person’s heaven or hell identi-cal with another’s in joy or in torment. Swedenborg learned from Leib-niz’s infinitely varied monad harmony that each soul has its ownother-world existence. The spirits form societies, which are in perfectharmony within themselves and with others, and the good societies areultimately joined in a universal unit, which has human form, Maximus Homo. 191Thus, each spirit becomes an infinitesimal corpuscle in this vast body, a counterpart of the tissue particles that Swedenborg hadheard of with humble reverence from the microscopists, and the uni-versal figure is permeated by divine life just as the spiritual fluid issupreme in the human body. Vigor and activity characterize Swedenborg’s spiritual world, re- gardless of the perspective from which he happens to treat it. In thevery first memorabilia in Arcana Coelestia, he emphasizes that the life of the angels consists of working for useful ends and of charitabledeeds. This means, among other things, that they combat the influenceof the evil spirits on living beings and awake in humans the desire forgoodness and purity. Another angelic task is also to instruct newly ar-rived spirits about heaven and its wonders; it is here that angels findtheir greatest happiness, in which respect they are in agreement withtheir chronicler. Some of these functions, distorted in the cracked glass of evil, are also performed by the inhabitants of hell. Every living being, though unaware of it, belongs to some society of spirits in the sense that he is united with at least two good and two evil spirits which balance each other’s influence. 192According to Swedenborg, man could not exist for a moment without these trans-mitters of the spiritual vital fluid; and he also associates this spiritual nexus with the frequent biblical references to the Lord speaking to humanity.

If these are exceeded,the diabolical crew is called to account; later on we shall see howSwedenborg envisaged this process. The section introducing chapter 11 of Genesis describes Sweden- borg’s conception of time and space in the spiritual world and of thepositions occupied by Maximus Homo in relation to the one truly fixed point of the universe, the Lord God. 193The spiritual societies are imagined to be separate in space, even though space does not exist inreality. Their positions and distances are established in relationship tothe observer, which means that if one society is to the right, it will al-ways be seen on the right, regardless of changes in the position of theobserver’s body. If one thinks of a spirit, it will immediately appear nomatter where it has been previously. When Swedenborg speaks ofspace and time in his stories of the spiritual world, which he does con-stantly, particularly in his later works, he thus takes full advantage ofpoetic license. His defense for this is not only pedagogical, but is alsobased on illustrious examples: the lower spirits are said to experiencespace and time in the worldly sense. With regard to the positions of angels and spirits, it is stated in Ar- canathat the angels are on the right side of the Lord, the evil spirits on the left—the pattern is, of course, set in the Word—the “intermediate”variety in front, and malicious spirits behind the Lord; the high-minded are above his head, and the torture chambers of hell are underhis feet. This order is immutable and, as we have seen, independent of the position of the observer. The grouping forms a Maximus Homo , and the reason for it is the omnipresence of the Lord. The universal spiritual being is the visualization of the Lord’s thought, a “materialization” ofl’ordre immuable , the unalterable order, which, as Swedenborg had learned from Malebranche, also applied to the Creator himself. Interpreted in this manner, Swedenborg’s philosophy in general and his spiritual vision in particular make an extremely static impres-sion. This may well be justified when one considers how he may have understood the original divine conception and its fulfillment, his attempts to concretize God’s eternal and actual presence in categoriesV i s i o n a r y S c i e n t i s t 152"

The Grand Man naturally must be regarded dynamically, as something that is constantly being perfected with thearrival of new souls and with the transpositions of spirits; for Sweden-borg did not believe in pre-existence in any sense other than that ofGod’s original conception, his providence, and his prescience. Indeed, spirits who awaken in the intermediate stage are in con- stant search for their right societies in the body of the Grand Man. It istrue that this search should not be regarded as a pilgrimage from oneplace to another, but rather as a change of condition: at the same timeit represents a dynamic process. In his efforts to make eternity compre-hensible to human beings, Swedenborg actually pursues his way ofthinking from De Infinito, and even then he was fully aware that no one living in the flesh can do more than confound the infinity of Godwith that of space and eternity with time ad infinitum . But he no longer fears these misunderstandings as he had in 1734, and insteadmakes the greatest virtue of necessity. He clearly relies on his generalreservations, which are frequently repeated and must be regarded as aninstruction to the reader to transpose his memorabilia with the help ofthe doctrine of correspondence. Maximus Homo is the all-inclusive form; but the most diverse scenes are included within its framework, and the seer sometimesspecifies their position in the body of the universal being. Swedenborgrelates in Arcanathat he once was led to a paradisiacal garden, which was situated “slightly above the corner of the right eye,” and there hefound the Eden of eternal spring as he had envisaged it in the works ofhis youth, with a varied and magnificent wealth of symbolical things: Certain souls lately deceased, who, in consequence of the principles they had imbibed in the world, doubted the possibility of such things existing in another life, where there is neither wood nor stone,being taken up into that paradise, and discoursing thence with me,said in their astonishment, that what they saw was inexpressible, andthat they could not represent its inexpressibility by any idea, and thatdelights and happiness shone forth from every object, and this withT h e S e c r e t s o f H e a v e n 153"

But the angelsbehold such things with other eyes, not being delighted with the par-adises, but with the representatives, and thus with the celestial andspiritual things which give them birth. It was from these celestial andspiritual things that the most ancient church derived their paradisia-cal scenery. Arcana Coelestia, n. 1622 [2] Spirits from Other Planets In Arcana Coelestia, Swedenborg also gives a systematic presentation of the spiritual societies in Maximus Homo, and he does not deny himself the pleasure of reaching out to the other planets of the solar system and even farther into space.194So tremendous is the universal being that its body cannot be constructed by terrestrial inhabitants only, butrequires a population spread through cosmos. We thus encounter inthe spiritual world Swedenborg’s version of the ancient dream of spacetravel, Lucian’s, Ariosto’s, and many others’ planetary visits, whichwere revived in Fontenelle’s Entretiens sur la pluralité des mondes— published 1686 but translated into Swedish in 1759. Swedenborg found it unreasonable that the tremendous planetary masses should be uninhabited and exist merely as sources of light forthe inhabitants of the earth. This would be in conflict with the divineprinciple of use, which governs cosmos. He therefore goes through theplanets, one after the other, and tells about meetings with spirits fromthem, after which he moves on to the firmament of fixed stars. Thebest of the planetary spirits originate in Mars. Their speech requires no external sound, but reaches the brain through an internal passage, via the Eustachian tube, in the same way as he believed was the case of thepeople of the most ancient church on earth. In Maximus Homo, whose organic correspondences were discussed at length in earlier sections ofArcana Coelestia , these former Martians constitute the intermediate province that connects the cerebrum with the cerebellum. 195 The inhabitants of Jupiter receive the greatest attention.

Their speech is exclusively physiog-nomical: that is to say, the face mirrors the soul without pretense. This,too, is in agreement with the original state on earth, and the origin ofall languages is thus mimetic; words were invented successively but notimmediately conveyed to Adam, as many scholars have believed in thehistory of linguistic theory. In the Grand Man, these spirits fromJupiter represent the “imaginative power of the mind.” Swedenborg’s scientific lack of prejudice allowed him to present undaunted the most absurd information about the lunar spirits. Theinhabitants of the moon speak not with the help of their lungs but fromthe abdomen in eructations—this odious phenomenon is called by itsmedical name—and the reason is difficult to contest: the moon, unlikeother “earths,” lacks its own atmosphere, and the lungs can thereforenot function as a source of the tremulation of the vocal cords. He also makes a number of calculations concerning the space needed for three hundred million beings from each of one millionplanets and stars for two hundred generations. No one can complainabout lack of concreteness on the part of the astronaut Swedenborg,nor accuse him of tellurian limitations. Still, Earth remains the centerof the universe in the most essential sense, since the Lord let himself beborn here. The main reason for this, according to Swedenborg, is thatthe art of writing is older here than on other planets, if it even existselsewhere. 196This gave the inhabitants of Earth better instruments to retain and disseminate the Word than other beings. Few arguments il-lustrate more clearly the extremely literary and intellectual nature of the inspiration that animated Swedenborg. The Last Judgment The many scattered reports on space at the end of Arcana Coelestia were assembled and put out in a small volume in 1758.197At the same time, Swedenborg published four minor works in London.

One day in 1748, he noted in Diarium Spirituale that he had seen the figure 57 in a vision.198This was neither the first nor the last time that he received this kind of numerical revelation, but on thisoccasion he combined it with his thoughts on the true meaning of theLast Judgment. Early in Arcana,he rejects the usual interpretation that the Day of Judgment represents the end of the world. 199To him it was quite clear that the doomsday trumpet would proclaim the end of all churches,the stage at which faith had disappeared. The Deluge was the LastJudgment of the oldest church, and the doomsday of the Israeliticchurch corresponded with the arrival of the Lord on earth. Certain ad-justments in Swedenborg’s writing of history occur later, but the basicpattern remains unchanged. The Christian church, which succeededthe Jewish, underwent a progressive deterioration; in his last work, heemphasized the Council of Nicaea (325 CE) as a fateful turning pointthrough its formulation of the Trinity dogma. A judgment nowawaited degenerate Christianity, and Swedenborg himself witnessedthe destruction of what he calls Babylon in the year 1757—here wehave the explanation of the vision of the figure 57. What then happened was confined to the world of spirits, and the story is told in De Ultimo Judicio (On the Last Judgment), a small trea- tise published in the productive year 1758. The spiritual societiesdoomed to extinction were peopled by spirits that had lived outwardlyimpeccable lives and had therefore been permitted to group them-selves in the outskirts of heaven. However, due to the miserable state offaith of the churches, these spirits grew so numerous that they threat-ened to destroy the connection between heaven and earth. Swedenborg specifies several confessions among these spirits and also different nations. Those in the worst predicament are the RomanCatholics, and it is their confession that he identifies with the Babylonof the Apocalypse. More precisely, Babylon refers to all who want torule with the help of religion. And this, according to Swedenborg, isthe aim of the Roman Catholic Church, whose most unforgivablecrime is that it conceals the Holy Writ from the layman.

It is obvious that the colors and shapes of thelugubrious landscape originate in the Revelation of St. John, to whichSwedenborg was to devote his hermeneutical labors during the nextdecade. In Vera Christiana Religio (The True Christian Religion , 1771), Swedenborg still retains his description of the Last Judgment in theworld of spirits of 1757, but his interest is now centered primarily onan explication of the words promising the Second Coming of theLord. 200This will not happen in persona but through the Word, through humanity’s regaining an understanding of its spiritual signifi-cance. The one who transmits this understanding is Swedenborg him-self, and with his emergence was founded the New Church, the churchknown as New Jerusalem in the Apocalypse. Swedenborg’s ponderingson the Last Judgment finally resulted in a definitive date. On June 19,1770, after the completion of Vera Christiana Religio, the Lord called together the twelve apostles, who had once accompanied him on earth,and sent them into the world of spirits to preach the gospel accordingto Emanuel Swedenborg. 201Naturally it is not expressed in that way, but the intent can scarcely be interpreted otherwise.

The interior ofAdam’s intellect is described as a hearth of gold and diamonds onwhich a fire burned clear and strong (n. 51, 67): the significance is ex-plained in a later passage in a manner closely reminiscent of the earli-est exposition in Clavis Hieroglyphica. In the work on heaven and hell published in 1758, De Coelo, which summarizes what was said in Arcana Coelestia in connection with the interpretation of the first two books of Moses, the doctrine of corre-spondence is exemplified by the animals mentioned in the biblical text: The animals of the earth, in general, correspond to affections; tame and useful animals to good affections; fierce and useless animals toevil affections. In particular, oxen and bullocks correspond to theaffections of the natural mind, and sheep and lambs to the affec-tions of the spiritual mind; but winged creatures, according to theirspecies, correspond to the intellectual things of both minds; andhence it is that various animals, as oxen, bullocks, rams, sheep, she-goats, he-goats, he-lambs, she-lambs, pigeons, and turtle-doves,were accepted for holy use in the Israelitic church; for that churchwas a representative church, and those animals were used as sacri-fices and burnt-offerings. For in that use they corresponded tothings spiritual, which were understood in heaven according to the correspondences.

The opposite to these heavenly dwellings are infernal localities, each one of which corresponds in its own way to the habits of its in-habitants, and their dominating love—amor regnans is Swedenborg’s basic concept when he tries to explain the distribution of the spiritsbetween the innumerable levels in the divine order. Those who hadbeen intriguing and treacherous live in dark caves, those who hadpracticed the sciences from intellectual pride live in sandy and sterileplaces, adulterers spend their days in hideous brothels (De Coelo, n. 488). Swedenborg also witnessed the dwellings of the most evil: theirholes and caves in barren mountains, their lairs and dens like those ofwild beasts in somber forests, their miserable cities of charred housesand hovels huddled together in alleys: Within the houses infernal spirits are engaged in continual quarrels, enmities, blows, and fightings; in the streets and lanes, robberies anddepredations are committed.

In the ten years between this work and De Coelo, Swedenborg had penetrated the Revelation in the same extremely detailed manner as hehad interpreted Genesis and Exodus in Arcana, and this exegetical study had a great influence on the new descriptions of the world ofspirits. They are much more individualized and concrete than before,and one feels that the author presents them with greater confidenceand a stronger aesthetic aspiration. De Amore Conjugiali seems to occupy the same place among the theosophical works as De Cultu et Amore Dei among the scientific, a sort of synthesis in a freer spirit of inspiration. That Swedenborg in-troduces the book with a detailed description of the world to comeseems almost to be a declaration of intent and a positive response tothose who, like Oetinger, wanted him to write only ex auditis et visis, from things heard and seen. In any case, these memorabilia representthe apex of his theosophical writings, and most of them also recur inthe work that Swedenborg intended to be his spiritual testament, Vera Christiana Religio (1771). 202 De Amore Conjugiali opens with an image from the general store- room of Christian art. An angel is in flight with a trumpet at his lips,garbed in a mantle flowing in the wind—we recognize the harbingerfrom an abundance of church paintings and ultimately from theApocalypse. The angel descends to Swedenborg, who is in the worldof spirits, and informs him of his task. The trumpet calls convokethose Christian spirits known for their wisdom and intelligence for adebate on the subject of celestial joy and eternal salvation; the reasonis that newly arrived spirits had told of the total ignorance of thesequestions on earth. The angels in one society now want to unearth thetruth for themselves, and the harbinger invites Swedenborg to listento the conference. After half an hour, two groups arrive from the north, the south, and the west and one from the east. The last group was invisible to the others, however, due to its powerful radiation—aswe recall, the Lord himself is always in the east.

The spirits from the north, who be-lieved that celestial joy consists of an unending witty conversation inthe full sense of the word, are ushered into a great house of more thanfifty rooms, in which various kinds of conversation are going on. Some of the groups are exchanging the news of the day, others are talking about women, court gossip, politics, business, and literature,about churches and sects—in other words, a conglomeration of what aman of the world like Swedenborg apparently would consider repre-sentative of the fashionable drawing-room culture of the day, a coun-terpart in the world of spirits to the European bourgeois society of theHabermas eighteenth-century model. When he is allowed to enter thehouse, Swedenborg encounters a familiar scene: some of those presentare eager to talk, others long to ask questions, a third group wants tolisten and learn. But many of them are in a state of desperation andcrave escape; they are exhausted after three days of social life. All exitsare closed, however, and their entreaties are answered with the cruellyironical words: “Remain and enjoy the joys of heaven” (n. 5). The merciful angel releases the captives from the curse of conver- sation, after having, in the manner of the teacher, pointed out to themthe lessons of their experience. Celestial joy is incompatible with a lifedevoted to pleasure; instead, its absolute prerequisite is usefulness, thefulfillment of social tasks.

Still, whenthey tried to get away, the priests seized them by the arms andsleeves, to push them into the buildings where they were to preach;but in vain. The people cried, “Let us alone. We shall swoon.” De Amore Conjugiali, n. 9 After having staged these scenes of concrete pedagogics in the spir- itual world, the angels open the door of heaven to a group of ten fa- vored ones, and they—including Swedenborg—experience the celestialrealities, which had been grossly caricatured by man’s dull imagina-tion. Here they are led to a palace of incomprehensible beauty: It was large, built of porphyry with a foundation of jasper, and had six lofty columns of lapis lazuli at the entrance. The roof was sheetsof gold; the lofty windows were of clearest crystal with frames ofgold. They were then conducted inside and led from room to room,where they saw ornamentation of ineffable beauty, and, decoratingthe ceilings, inimitable carved work. Along the walls stood silver ta-bles inlaid with gold on which were various useful articles of pre-cious stones and of whole gems in heavenly patterns. De Amore Conjugiali, n.12 The palace is set in a park in which the trees are arranged in a way which seems to allow for endless extension; obviously, he refers here to what he called in Oeconomia the perpetuo-spiral form, the form of vortical movement that is the highest that can exist materially. The vis-itors are invited to meet the prince of the angelic society and to sup athis table; and Swedenborg takes the time to describe in detail the garbof the prince and the members of his court, a peculiar example of hisability to combine acute memories of observed facts with symbolical fantasies: He was dressed in a long purple robe, embroidered with stars of the color of silver. Under the robe he wore a tunic of shining silk of a blue shade. This was open at the breast, where the badge of hisT h e S e c r e t s o f H e a v e n 163"

The chief counsellors wore garments not unlike those ofthe prince but without the badge, in place of which carved sapphireshung from the neck by a gold chain. The courtiers wore gowns ofbrown, on which were woven flowers around young eagles. Their tunics were of an opal-colored silk, as were their breeches and stockings. De Amore Conjugiali, n. 15 The guests are also allowed to converse with wise men about salva- tion; for three days, they live the heavenly life in the city by the palace: they are invited to a wedding, representing the marriage between theLord and the church, which also signifies the union of love and wis-dom; and finally they take part in the heavenly celebration of the sab-bath and hear an inspiring sermon on the Word. We cannot dwell longer on this introductory memorabile. It ends with a series of references to the books of Revelation, Ezekiel, andDaniel, which obviously were the principal sources of inspiration forthe celestial scenes. To this biblical background should be addedSwedenborg’s classical learning, his obvious fascination with emblem-atics as evidenced by the eagles, and his familiarity with life at courtand in palatial surroundings. Marriages in Heaven De Amore Conjugiali treats marital love, and the first chapter intro- duces the problems. It is symptomatic that the first memorabile de- scribes a wedding in heaven and explains its symbolical meaning: itgives the key to the continuation. The doctrine of marriages in heavenplays a central role in Swedenborg’s theosophy; but it remains a con-troversial and, to him, a problematic role, especially in view of Christ’sreply to the Sadducees in all the synoptic gospels that there will be nomarriages after the resurrection (Matthew 22:23–32; Mark. 12:18–27;Luke 20:27–38).

But his gospel undoubtedly has moreprofound personal roots. The Journal of Dreams bears traces of a strong sexuality, and he frequently expressed great interest in the phys-iological and psychological problems of sex in his scientific writings;his experiences in le beau monde must also have brought the moral question into harsh and painful focus for a man with his reverence forthe divine order. It is scarcely surprising, but perhaps pathetic, that theelderly bachelor gave marriage, in the full and rich sense of the term,such a central position in his vision of the land of beatitude. And asentimental tradition has it that he mentioned by name a lady of highdegree as his future wife in heaven; even if untrue, it is probable thathis exquisite descriptions of married couples in heaven were influ-enced by his own dream of happiness. 205 At the same time, it would be quite wrong to portray these heav- enly scenes as sentimental. On the contrary, they are characterized bythe same delight in factual data and the same peculiar objectivity as al-ways, and in addition often by a tolerant humor, which is sometimesirresistible. For example, he tells of three newly arrived spirits, two ofwhom were young men bursting with sexual power and desire. Theyare told that, although there is love between the sexes in heaven, it ischaste and has no resemblance to mundane lust. The young men arecrushed: “Just what is sexual love without allurements?” the newcomers ask. As they thought about this love, they sighed and exclaimed: “Oh,how insipid is the joy of heaven! What young man can desire heaventhen? Is such love not empty and lifeless?” De Amore Conjugiali, n. 44 [3] Their spiritual mentors laugh at their reaction and the naked sex- ual appetite it reveals.

They go on to say that the chastity of newcomers to heaven is tested by leaving them alone with young girls, who perceive from the tone of voice and from the speech, face, eyes, bearing, and outflowing sphere, what their quality is in respect tolove for the sex; and if it is unchaste they flee away, and tell theircompanions that they have seen satyrs or priapi. De Amore Conjugiali, n. 44 [4] This, of course, further chills the ardor of the curious playboys, who continue their complaints. The spirits now become irritated by their childishness and reprimand them. In heaven, the only sexual loveis between spouses, and what the young men have in mind is clearly aprodigal sowing of wild oats. This, however, is literally unthinkable inheaven; but all the delights of love can be enjoyed in marriage. No chil-dren are conceived, only spiritual offspring of love and wisdom, whichresults in happy consequences, interpreted by Swedenborg with thehelp of his old physiological model: Hence it is, too, that angels do not become sad after the delights, as some do on earth, but cheerful. This results from the perpetual in-flux of fresh powers succeeding the former, renewing and enlighten-ing the angels. For all who come into heaven return into thespringtime of their youth and into the vigor of those years, and re-main so to eternity. De Amore Conjugiali, n. 44 [9] This last feature was stressed in Arcana Coelestia as a feature of heavenly bliss: there would be no ailing old men or faded old women, but only young people in the prime of life.206When the dead reach the interim stage, they may sometimes meet their husband or wife and livetogether for a time. The more detached they grow from their mortalselves, the clearer becomes the true nature of their union.

The antique notion of the four ages of theearth was important to him throughout his career as a writer, andnow it is combined with the idea of heavenly marriages. What is in-teresting about these memorabilia, however, is not so much whatthey have to relate but the way they are staged. The description ofhis pilgrimage to these parts with an angel as cicerone is in itself fas-cinating and recalls both Divina Commedia and Pilgrim’s Progress — not to imply that Swedenborg actually read Dante’s work, which ishardly likely. The pilgrimage to the angelic society of the Golden Age leads to- ward the east through a great desert and a dense forest, where manypaths could take him astray and bring him to Tartarus: this is obviously a wanderer who remembers the visit Aeneas paid to Hades.But the angel recognizes the signs: it is necessary to follow a row ofolive trees entwined by vines, and soon they arrive at a great plain, dotted by thousands of tents. There live the Lord’s warriorsfrom the most ancient times, and their dwellings obviously corre- spond with earthly habitations from the days when they lived as mortals. In conversations with a married couple, the pilgrims learnof the strict monogamy and absolute chastity of the Golden Age; andSwedenborg is given a pomegranate with seeds of gold as a farewell gift. 208 The next day they set out for the realm of the Silver Age.

The peoples of this epoch had a knowledge of correspon-dences; and as every man, beast, bird or fish corresponds to somequality, therefore each piece of sculpture represents an aspect ofvirtue or truth, and several together the virtue or truth itself as awhole. They are what in Egypt were called hieroglyphics. De Amore Conjugiali, n. 76 Here we have a concretization of his recurrent remarks about the origin of the hieroglyphs in the theory of correspondence; and the en- tire representation of the society of the Silver Age is more marked bythe doctrina correspondentiarum than usual, which agrees with his view of how the Word has been passed down, as we shall see later. When thepilgrims reach their destination, they first see many horses and chari-ots, which, however, are quickly transformed into men roamingaround and speaking with one another. The angel explains: Semblances of horses, chariots and stables, seen at a distance, are ap- pearances of the rational intelligence of the men of this epoch. Forby correspondence a horse signifies the understanding of truth; achariot, doctrine about truth; and stables, instruction. In this world,you know, all things appear according to correspondences. De Amore Conjugiali, n.113 Comparable correspondences have already been described in de- tail by Swedenborg in his treatise on the white horse of the Revelation of St. John (De Equo Albo, 1758), in which he interpreted the classical Pegasus myth according to the same pattern. This time he explains thesymbolic import of the houses and temples, wall paintings and statues,even moving pictures of rainbows and other light phenomena, all in the form of a dialogue with an inhabitant in one of the cities of the Sil-ver Age. His farewell gift this time is a bunch of grapes with vine leaves, and these leaves are suddenly transformed into silver—an Ovidianmetamorphosis with its symbolical mythical motif adjusted to his ownall-embracing correspondence system.

The cities are irregularlyconstructed, the materials wood and brick, the walls hung with idols—a picture of confusion, but not yet of obduracy and hopelessness. This comes in the fifth epoch, which corresponds to the feet of iron and clay in Nebuchadnezzar’s dream of a statue in the Book ofDaniel (2:31–45). The people of this age are not able to differentiatebetween conjugal love and licentiousness, and they are seized with rageand a lust to kill when Swedenborg and his companion try to teachthem the truth. But the men of light know how to defend themselves: By power given us by the Lord we held up our hands, and fiery ser- pents, vipers, hydras and dragons appeared from the desert, andrushed in and filled the city, from which the inhabitants fled in terror. De Amore Conjugiali, n.131–132. Thus we have been told of marital love in its celestial, spiritual, natural, and sensual form in the four ages of the world of classical mythology and Old Testament eschatology; and finally Swedenborghas given us a sense of scortatory love, the evil opposite of marital love.He does this in pedagogically effective scenes, which to him must havemet all the requirements of hieroglyphic significance. With thesupreme freedom from limitations in time and space that characterizeslife after death, he is able to preach his gospel to diverse otherworldlyaudiences. For example, a number of memorabilia are set in the heav-enly Athens, to which Swedenborg is brought by an angel to meet theancient sages who had exerted such a decisive influence on his life: Looking ahead from a considerable prominence I beheld a city, and to one side of it two hills, the one nearer the city lower than theother. He told me, “That city is called Athens, the lower hill, Parnas-sus, and the higher, Helicon. All are so called because in and aboutthe city dwell ancient wise men of Greece, like Pythagoras, Socrates,Aristippus and Xenophon, with their disciples and neophytes.” IT h e S e c r e t s o f H e a v e n 169"

De Amore Conjugiali, n.113 This episode not only gives a vivid summary of Swedenborg’s phi- losophy of love, but is also a typical example of his weakness for Africans, which you may look upon as his personal version of eigh-teenth-century primitivism; he believed that a more unadulterated re-lationship to God still existed in native peoples, maybe a trace of themedieval legend of Prester John and his Christian kingdom as will bediscussed later on. The construction of the episode is also characteris-tic. Most of the later memorabilia consist of speeches, debates, and di-alogues, with extensive use of rhetorical questions, as in the passagejust quoted. Swedenborg himself participates in many of them, partic-ularly toward the end of De Amore Conjugiali. In these exchanges, he is not plagued by his severe stammer and inability to lecture as in the realworld; instead, he presents his opinions authoritatively, on one occa-sion by reading long passages from one of his earlier works. Nevertheless, De Amore Conjugiali ends on a note of pain and dis- appointment. It concludes with a memorabile, in which he is the lead-ing character and which recurs in a corresponding place in Vera Christiana Religio. There he tells of still another visit to a society of an-gels, where sages, thirsty for knowledge, ask for news of the world. Inreply, he reports on his own activities as a transmitter of heavenly se-crets: that the Word has a spiritual significance which stands outclearly since the revival of the science of correspondence; that menhave learned of life after death, of the Last Judgment, of the essence ofthe Lord, Christ and the Holy Trinity, of the new church. Undeniably,he has been assigned a task more wonderful than anyone else, and hehas made tremendous efforts to fulfil it; nonetheless, he is sad and theangels are told the reason: Because although the arcana revealed today by the Lord surpass in excellence and worth the knowledge hitherto made known, they arenevertheless considered on earth as of no value.

On request, they write down the se-crets listed on a piece of paper, which is then released from the heavens: And behold, in its descent while still in the spiritual world it shone like a star; but as it dropped down into the natural world the lightdisappeared, and by degrees, as it descended, was veiled in darkness.And when it was let down by the angels into companies where therewere learned and accomplished men—from among clergy andlaity—a murmur was heard from many of them, in which were thesewords: “What is this? Is it anything? What does it matter whether weknow these things or do not know them? Are they not offspring ofthe brain?” It seemed as if some of them took the paper and folded,and rolled, and unrolled it with their fingers, to obliterate the writ-ing. And it seemed as if some tore it to pieces, and as if some wantedto trample it under foot. They were withheld by the Lord from thatoutrage, however, and the angels were commanded to withdraw thepaper and guard it. De Amore Conjugiali, n. 533;Vera Christiana Religio, n. 848 Swedenborg mentions, finally, that the Lord had revealed the truth about marital love to him, but he doubts that humanity is willing to accept the message. At that point, the angels urge him to write a bookand make the revelation known to humankind, a book that the angelswill send down from heaven. This obviously refers to the work whichthe memorabile concludes. Undeniably, a treatise that specificallynames the angels as the publishers is a rarity in the history of litera- ture; but after a quarter of a century of daily interaction with spiritsand angels, Swedenborg did not hesitate in face of the most provoca-tive consequences. That the wounded pride of the author is reflectedhere is indubitable and not surprising to the historian: no man wants to speak to deaf ears, particularly if he is convinced of his mission as aprophet.V i s i o n a r y S c i e n t i s t 172"

      "text": "Conclusion The survey of Emanuel Swedenborg’s interpretation of the secrets of heaven represents merely a collection of examples, but some sense ofits unique character may have emerged. One cannot help noticing howhe grew ever more confident in his mastery of expression that he hadgained from the system of correspondence. In the Spiritual Diary, one occasionally has the feeling that Swedenborg was overwhelmed by hisexperiences and unable to direct them. The published works, however,particularly the later ones, give an increasingly strong impression ofliterary awareness and deliberation: it is the philosophy at which hehas arrived that determines his visions, rather than the contrary. Hefrees himself from his scientific heritage in various ways. His desire toexplain the behavior of the spirits with the aid of the doctrine of formand other psychophysiological theories declines as he comes to under-stand the biblical authors when they say that one must speak to men interms that they can comprehend. This means, of course, that his own memorabilia must be inter- preted in the light of the doctrine of correspondence. A distinction inArcana Coelestia between representatives and appearances reveals the need for different categories of symbols, but it is not subsequently ex-ploited explicitly or systematically. 210 What appears to become increasingly essential for Swedenborg is to communicate a picture of immortal existence as a state of life andactivity, of useful work and joy of learning, of love and fellowship; and,to scholars at least, his rather idealized eighteenth-century world ap-pears to be very attractive. The dream of an individual’s intrinsic worth and of his or her future life finds strangely concrete expressions in Swedenborg, expressions that are related to his scientific back- ground and also to later trends in the history of ideas and of literature.Before touching on these traditions, however, we must considerSwedenborg’s theology, particularly his way of interpreting the HolyWrit.

Nor is it surprising that he fitted his biblicalstudies into his scientific research program, as outlined in 1734, inview of its universal aspirations. But what is the background, beyondthat stated at the time, of the hermeneutics to which he devoted hisenormous energy after 1745? When we look for an answer to this question, we, unfortunately, discover that no thorough historical investigation of Swedenborg as anexegete has ever been made. 211This circumstance is highly indicative of theologians’ evaluation of Swedenborg’s contribution, but it is re-grettable, since the lack of such studies makes it more difficult to de-termine the potential influences of his theological environment.Among his contemporaries, we often find mention of sources of inspi- ration, most frequently, perhaps, Jacob Boehme and Kabbalahism,which need clarification. With regard to Boehme, Swedenborg himself had something to say. One of his few Swedish disciples asked the master in a letter for hisopinion of Boehme and a certain “L.”: the initial probably refers to thewell-known English follower of Boehme, William Law (1686–1761). Inhis reply, Swedenborg denied that he had read them. In reality, he hadbeen forbidden to read theological works before the heavenly secrets"

When his inner vision was finallyopened, he would first have to learn Hebrew and to establish the corre-spondences of the Word, and for this reason he came to read the Biblerepeatedly. 212This fact is also fully confirmed by the great volumes of indices. Swedenborg’s denial of Boehme’s influence is of late date—1767— but such an influence has nevertheless been postulated by many latercritics. However, no one has been able to present any proof; if onetakes the trouble to make a comparative study, it appears quite clearlythat there are no evident similarities, merely such general ones as resultfrom all searches for a spiritual meaning beyond the letter of the Word.The same seems to apply to J. C. Dippel (1673–1734), the radicalpietist who paid a dramatic visit to Stockholm at the end of the 1720s,at which time Swedenborg may even have met him: a certain theologi-cal influence is hinted at in Diarium Spirituale, but cannot apply to the exegesis. 213 In his letter, Swedenborg stresses what he had said so many times in his writings: that to him the Word was the source of all theology,which implies, among other things, a categorical rejection of all nat-ural theology. If the evaluation of the Word in principle is immutablysublime until the very end, there are, nevertheless, considerable differ-ences in details and traces of an evolution. This does not apply to hisconviction of the correspondence character of the Word, but rather tohis opinion of its tradition, its levels of significance and kinds of style—always, however, with the reservation that much that appears tobe contradictory or new may be due to obscure phrasing and differentcontexts in the massive theosophical volumes. As already mentioned, Swedenborg had made a preliminary grouping of biblical texts in different correspondence categories evenbefore his acute spiritual crisis. It is noteworthy, however, that thisgrouping was never used in later writings.

The attempt ismade after an explication of Genesis 28:12–15, which deals withJacob’s dream in Betel and the promise that his seed would be dissem-inated over the earth. 214 The first level is that of the letter, sensus externus, historicus seu Lit- eralis; it thus concerns only the event or the individual explicitly men-tioned in the text, or the historical Jacob in the case of the example.The second significance refers to the descendants of the individualsmentioned and their destinies, which, in the example, means the Jew-ish people: this is known as an inner or higher significance (sensus in- ternus, superior ac universalis). The third level comprises an even widerdomain: in the example all those who in any way are in communica-tion with Jacob, that is, the Christian church (sensus interior, univer-salior, coelestis et spiritualis) . Finally, there is a fourth and supreme level, which refers to the Messiah and thus the entire future of worldevents; this level is labeled intimus, universalissimus, divinus and is the plenitude of the truth. In the hypostatical phraseology so typical ofSwedenborg in such contexts, he asserts that the preceding signifi-cances regard the last-mentioned one as their innermost, their pur-pose, life, soul, and spiritual light. The Word thus comes to correspondto creation in general and to humankind in particular. For in the in-nermost depth of all people, there is the soul, which in the shape of thespiritual fluid acts as giver of life even to the outermost tissues; and thefour facultatesfrom animato the body clearly find their counterparts in the number of meanings in the Word. Swedenborg thereby defined the model that he followed in his new sphere of activity: it is the psychophysical doctrine of series and de-grees from Oeconomia Regni Animalis, which he called the premise for the coming universal language; and since the Word in principle consti- tutes this universal language, this application is a natural consequence.It obviously does not exclude impulses from scientific studies of theBible, particularly since the practical detailed examination of the textsT h e L o r d a n d H i s W o r d 177"

When he formulated the interpretation ofGenesis 28:14, his point of departure once again was a Latin transla-tion, but his Hebrew studies were soon to begin. 215 It is easy to associate between Swedenborg’s four levels of signifi- cance and the medieval exegetical practice, which was researched mostexhaustively by Henri de Lubac in an admirably learned work with thesubtitle Les quatre sens de l’Ecriture (The Four Meanings of the Word). 216If a connection could be proven, it would undoubtedly pro- vide a more solid foundation than is offered by the concept of “allegor-ical biblical interpretation.” This phrase is constantly used in theSwedenborgian literature, but it is ambiguous to the point of meaning-lessness and comprises elements that Swedenborg rejected outright. The allegorical method of reading texts is encountered as far back as in the Greek Homeric interpretations of the sixth century BCE; bythe time of Jesus’ birth, it had reached a high degree of systematizationin the Stoics and the Neo-Pythagoreans. The rabbinical tradition alsoincluded this allegorical method, although clearly distinguished fromthe Greek. Where the Greeks looked for philosophical propositions inmystical disguise, the rabbis wanted to achieve as complex an interpre-tation as possible. However, the Jews of the Diaspora, particularlyPhilo Judaeus, adhered completely to the Greek allegoristic method,and they passed it on to Christian hermeneutics. There is no need to question Swedenborg’s general understanding of these things, which is proven both by his own studies and by his long relationship with Erik Benzelius, a prominent specialist on Philo. How familiar Swedenborg was with the rabbinic tradition and theKabbalah is uncertain, but one can find numerous examples of an ex-tremely negative attitude on his part: almost concurrently with the ex-plication of Genesis 28:14, he anathematized all philosophy (with the exception of his own works, to be sure) in Diarium Spirituale, and in- cluded in philosophy “fables and silly stories, especially such as have formerly and do still distinguish the Rabbinical writers, which are in-numerable.” 217Statements of this nature should make us extremelyV i s i o n a r y S c i e n t i s t 178"

Through his extensive reading, which is documented in his ex- cerpts and in his printed treatises, Swedenborg became familiar withexegetic principles beyond those he had learned in his youth andthrough “incidental learning” as a member of a large clerical family.At the same time, it should be emphasized that no traces remain ofsystematic studies of the nature of the philosophical researches incod. 36–110. His knowledge of as tremendously an influential writeras St. Augustine was probably considerable and may even have in-cluded the hermeneutic discussions in De Doctrina Christiana . Au- gustine was of decisive importance to the success of the Alexandrineallegorists. 218A part of this tradition was a legacy from Origen, who established similar correspondences between the Word and human-ity to those we find in Swedenborg. According to Origen (and StPaul!), the human being consists of body, soul, and spirit, and theWord that refers to our salvation must have three corresponding lev-els of significance—a literal, a moral, and a mystical: “Like man, ithas a body, a soul and a spirit; whence the terms of a corporeal sensefor history, a psychical sense for morality, and a spiritual sense for al-legory (or anagogy).” 219 Other scholars replaced these three levels by four, but de Lubac’s study makes it clear that this did not represent any basic change, sincethe same writer sometimes works with four and sometimes with threesignificances. Nicholas of Lyra (c. 1270–1349) wrote a widely dissemi- nated mnemonic rhyme, in which the four levels are named, but itsunderlying reality is far more complicated than the simple Latin inwhich it is expressed Littera gesta docet, quid credas allegoria, Moralis quid agas, quo tendas anagogia.220 These four significances form two groups, called sensus litteralis vel historicus and sensus mysticus seu spiritualis , respectively. Accord- ing to Nicholas, the latter is thus tripartite, and the difference be- tween the groups is that the import of the first one is per voces,T h e L o r d a n d H i s W o r d 179"

The latter is divided, as the verse tells us, into sensus allegoricus, moralis vel tropologicus , and ana- gogicus. The first of these is involved if that which is said shall be re- ferred to what we should believe according to the new law. It is thus identical with what others call figural or typological significance, anevent in the Old Testament that prophesies something in the NewTestament, or, to use Swedenborg’s earlier terminology, a case of cor- respondentia typica . The second spells out a moral instruction from the biblical text, and the third refers to what we can hope for inheaven. The name Jerusalem is the example most frequently used in these contexts. Literally, of course, it means the city in Palestine, alle-gorically it represents the Christian church, tropologically the soul ofman, and anagogically the heavenly city in the Revelation of St. Johnthe Divine. If we stop for a second to draw a comparison with Swedenborg’s conceptual arsenal, we see both similarities and differences. In Clavis Hieroglyphica we find four categories of correspondence, all of which, however, clearly belong under Nicholas’ sensus mysticus. Furthermore, only one of them corresponds in any sense to the traditional, namely,correspondentia typica. In Swedenborg’s version, however, this typolog-ical significance also embraces the anagogical. The classification in Ad- versariais actually more reminiscent of the medieval practice. There we find sensus litteralis vel historicus and three inner levels of signifi- cance. None of them, however, adheres fully to Nicholas’ definitions,but Swedenborg appears to have roamed very freely within the tradi-tional framework, regardless of how familiar he was with its details. The pattern corresponds best with Origen’s, and the correspondence iseven greater at a later stage, when Swedenborg included animusin the body and thereby reduced the number of facultatesto three. We shall return to this point shortly. Swedenborg was not content with abstract speculations of this nature. His ruminations on the problems of interpretation can be illustrated by comparing the three different interpretations of the first chapter of Genesis that he produced in the years between 1745V i s i o n a r y S c i e n t i s t 180"

In the one immediately succeeding the drama of creation, De Cultu et Amore Dei , the principal aspect is still cosmogonical, and the “allegorical” elements are confined to his making the days of the creation represent very long periods of time, which, of course, is completely in accordance with an ancient Christian tradition. 221 The next version, which introduces the real Adversaria , does, ad- mittedly, take up the cosmogonical aspects; but the point of view hasnow been altered to what a medieval exegete would probably call an-agogical. Swedenborg claims that he now wants to examine the Wordto learn about civitas Dei , the ultimate purpose of the creation. This means that the emphasis in the first chapter will be on man in his state of integrity, the first reflection of the Kingdom of God in nature: He was born in the most perfect order, that is, after the likeness of God; thus the last was represented in the first. Wherefore nowhereelse in the Old Testament, except in the first-born beings before thefall, can we contemplate an effigy of that kingdom; namely, that in itwill exist a like order, but still more perfect because existing in an en-tire society which will form one body and will live with one spirit;and thus, by means of the one only Love by whom that order com-mences and in whom it ends, will come a most perfect image ofGod. 222 In Arcana Coelestia, we find a radically consistent application of this symbolism. Now Swedenborg ignores the literal significance and gives only the inner meaning, which, admittedly, is frequently differentiated, but without the rigid systematization of the previousdraft. It is obvious that his greater experience with practicalhermeneutics and his study of Hebrew had partly changed the nature of the problem. One illustration of this is that, as early as in his com-mentary on the first chapter, he tries to give a brief survey of what he calls the different styles of the Word, which is intended to clarifyhis evaluation of the text in concretu and of the historical background.T h e L o r d a n d H i s W o r d 181"

      "text": "Arcana Coelestia According to Arcana Coelestia n. 66, there are four types of style in the Word. The first is that of the most ancient church and expresses an ex- clusively spiritual meaning: their mode of expression was such that when they mentioned terres- trial and worldly things they thought of the spiritual and celestialthings which these represented. They therefore only expressed them-selves by representatives, but also formed these into a kind of histor-ical series, in order to give them more life; and this was to themdelightful in the very highest degree. Arcana Coelestia, n. 61 It appears from subsequent passages that the difference between this church and the next one—the one that came after the Deluge— was the exact counterpart of the difference between the celestial andthe spiritual. The people of the most ancient church spoke not inwords but through direct transference of thoughts and facial expres-sions. Where they experienced a direct inner sense of the true and thegood, the next era instead had “another kind of dictate; which may becalled conscience” (Arcana Coelestia, n. 607). The differences are also reflected in style. Until the days of Abra- ham, the Word was written in reproductions of the most ancient lan-guage, which Moses inherited from his ancestors, but the remainingbooks of Moses and the books of Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kingsare written in the second style, which Swedenborg calls the historical.In these books, historical material is presented in the literal sense, al- though there is also an inner meaning, which he promises to reveal later. The third style, that of the prophets, sprang, according to Swedenborg, from the original church: the difference is that its char-acter is not so consistent or so “historical” but more disparate, whichmakes it almost incomprehensible unless one has the key to the innermeaning. Finally, Swedenborg distinguishes a fourth level of style inthe Psalms, “halfway between prophetic and everyday speech.”V i s i o n a r y S c i e n t i s t 182"

      "text": "This means, therefore, a rough classification in “mythical,” histori- cal, prophetic, and poetic parts, which in itself is not particularly orig- inal. Nor is it surprising that Swedenborg was later compelled to makecertain adjustments and to distinguish intermediate forms. What isoriginal is his way of combining these stylistic observations with thetheory of correspondence. The pervading idea is that the members ofthe most ancient church lived a symbolical existence characterized bycorrespondences, but that their unconscious and intuitive spiritualitywas lost after the Deluge. This spirituality was then replaced by a con-scious but not fully realized symbolism, a theoryof correspondence but no longer a lifeof correspondence; and this doctrine found differ- ent expressions: in the Jewish church in liturgical rites and symbolsand in the Holy Writ, in Egypt in hieroglyphics, in Greece in mythol-ogy, etc. Swedenborg considers that the concealment of the inner significance of the Word under a “historical” mantle is justified peda-gogically: it shall make such thrilling reading that even children will beattracted to it. Naturally enough, there are a number of other distinctions in Ar- cana Colestia, including a classification of the meaning of letters inthree subsections, historicus, propheticus, and doctrinalis, but no really decisive changes in the textual-historical pattern are to be found in thiswork. Since Swedenborg here is trying to disclose the spiritual signifi-cance, his expressions of the literal meaning are often negative. Thisappears most clearly in a paragraph toward the end of the great work,where he states categorically which books shall be regarded as theWord, namely, only those that have an inner meaning. All the books ofthe Old Testament are included, with the exception of Ruth, Chroni-cles, Ezra, Nahum, Esther, Job, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and the Song ofSolomon, while the New Testament is represented only by the HolyGospels and the Revelation of St. John the Divine (Arcana Coelestia, n. 10325). This obviously is highly restrictive; and it is tempting to regard it as self-doubt on the part of the author when faced with the tremen-dous task of revealing the spiritual significance.T h e L o r d a n d H i s W o r d 183"

      "text": "The Doctrine of Correspondence in the Hermeneutic Function After his analysis of Genesis and Exodus in Arcana Coelestia, Sweden- borg presented no systematic study of any other Bible book than the Revelation of St. John the Divine, but obviously all the theosophicaltreatises contain innumerable textual interpretations. He also pub-lished a special small tract on the Bible in the 1760s, many of the doc-trines of which recur in Vera Christiana Religio and thus represent his definitive standpoint. 223 Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Sacred Scriptures, the imposing title of the small tract, is introduced by an argument thatSwedenborg had already used on many occasions, namely, that manypeople do not grasp the sublimity of the Word because its style is sosimple and so unlike the flowery mode of expression of the day: one ofmany attacks on rhetorical ideals of style. In the Word are concealedthe most profound secrets, accessible to those who are able to pene-trate beyond the letter. From the love of the Lord springs the celestial,which is also the divine good, and from his wisdom the spiritual,which is the divine truth: these two are united in their utmost radia-tion, the natural. For the Word to be perfect, it must correspond withthese three degrees, and the literal meaning thus contains two highersignificances, just as an effect contains both its active cause and its finalcause. Clearly this must be a matter of discrete degrees, which, unlike continuous degrees, do not successively merge with one another, but can only be united through correspondence. The Word is thus written with correspondences, and here Swedenborg presents his firstsurvey of the history of the science of correspondence. In general, we are familiar with it from Arcana Coelestia , but Swedenborg claims that he has now been taught that the Enoch mentioned inGenesis 5:21–24 had collected these disiecta membra of ancient wis- dom and passed them on to posterity. Enoch was Noah’s great- grandfather, and his descendants spread the tradition throughout theV i s i o n a r y S c i e n t i s t 184"

Dur-ing the course of the centuries, however, the repraesentativa of the churches, which, of course, were correspondences, were transformedinto various kinds of idols, whereupon providence consigned the sci-ence of correspondence to oblivion: this is how Swedenborg presentswhat he had understood from Wolff, thirty years previously, about themetamorphosis of the hieroglyphs into idolatry. The lost science was not revived until Swedenborg’s day, and he gives three explanations for this: (1) the first Christians were too unlet-tered to understand it; (2) the popes later withheld the Bible from hu-mankind; and (3) while the Reformation admittedly returned the Bibleto the laity, at the same time, a theologically unfortunate distinctionwas made between faith and way of life—Swedenborg’s recurring ac-cusation of solifidianism—and this carries a risk of the correspon-dences being referred solely to faith and not to love also. 225 Once Swedenborg had revived the science of correspondence, the way was opened to inconceivable spiritual treasures. But the premise isthe literal meaning, for which he now expresses great respect. Withoutthe letter, the Word would be like a body without skin or bones, like abrain without membranes and skull, like a heart and lungs without athorax. When a person reads the letter of the Word, a spiritual angelbrings forth the spiritual significance and a heavenly angel the celestial meaning. The latter cannot be visualized, however, since it is not acces- sible to the intelligence but acts on the will alone. That it exists is proved, for example, by the Bible’s predilection for parallelisms, which Swedenborg regarded even in Arcana Coelestia as a linguistic corre- spondence to the marriage between the true and the good, but it canalso be experienced as a vitalizing force. 226 The connection with heaven is opened by this Word, which also came into existence for the inhabitants of heaven and the spiritual world. It applied to earlier churches; but after the incarnation of theLord, which, as we have learned from the Gospel according to St. John,T h e L o r d a n d H i s W o r d 185"

Since the Word has always existed somewhere on Earth,the communication with heaven was secured even for those whothemselves did not possess it, except in distorted reflections, as, for ex-ample, the Greeks and, later, the Mohammedans. 227 This interpretation of history is complemented in a strange fash- ion in some of Swedenborg’s last works. In his second great exegeticwork, Apocalypsis Revelata (1766), he reports that he had learned in conversations with Tartar angels that the so-called Verbum vetustum, a pre-Israelitic Writ, was still known to the peoples of Great Tartary. Itwas said to consist solely of correspondences, and it embraced theolder traditions referred to in various parts of the Bible: liber Jaschar, Bella Jehovae, and Enuntiata in Swedenborg’s Latin translation. 228The same information is repeated in De Amore Conjugiali in connection with the visit to the angels of the Age of Copper described earlier: theseangels are alleged to possess the Asiatic Word, which is now preservedin Magna Tartaria. It also recurs with minor variations in the lastwork, Vera Christiana Religio. 229 One may wonder about the origin of these strange notions, which Swedenborg himself explicitly attributed to a new revelation. Tartaryand its inhabitants belong to the legendary concepts in European his-tory, and Swedenborg’s contemporaries appear to have had very vaguenotions of its geographical position and its culture. Great Tartary, asdistinguished from the more westerly areas, which sometimes werecalled Little Tartary or Crimean Tartary, was believed to lie somewhere in the great table lands of Central Asia. 230The border between it and China was also unclear; but in Apocalypsis Revelata, Swedenborg sug- gests with the scientist’s characteristic desire for empiric certitude, thatenquiries in China should confirm what the angels had said about theremarkable Tartars. At least a part of the explanation of Swedenborg’s claim might be found in the medieval legend, according to which the so-called king-dom of Prester John was located in the realm of the Tartars.

When Marco Polo and otheradventurous travelers in Asia in the thirteenth century reached Tartarterritory, they soon discovered that no Christian king was there; butthis did not put an end to the legend. Instead, John’s alleged kingdomwas transferred first to India and later to Africa. As late as the seven-teenth century, the official name of Abyssinia was Regnum Presbyteri Johannis,the realm of Prester John, and the legend survived in other forms until the middle of the nineteenth century. It is difficult to establish how Swedenborg came into contact with this myth, which probably had its origin in lack of knowledge of thehistory of Christian mission. In any event, his claims are strange ex-pressions of the strong interest in Asia, particularly Chinese culture,which the reports of the Jesuit missionaries aroused in cultivated Eu-ropeans, not least in Leibniz. 231Anders Hallengren has recently pointed out that the Swedish prisoners of war, who spent many yearsin Siberia after the battle of Poltava, might also be an interesting con-nection, particularly since Swedenborg’s cousin Peter Schönström andhis friend Philip Johan von Strahlenberg were among the captured of-ficers, who devoted themselves to mapping and making other re-searches about Central Asia: Strahlenberg even identified the legendaryPrester John with Dalai Lama. 232 In Swedenborg’s own development, these and other similar re- ports represent the last link in a larger tendency to fit his exegesisinto a historical tradition. Swedenborg never claimed to have in- vented his hermeneutic principles, but constantly stresses that he hadrevived a form of knowledge originally regarded as the science of all sciences. Obviously, his thesis would receive the best support con-ceivable if he could find literary testimony more ancient than theBible and written in the language of correspondences. That Sweden-borg’s dream was fulfilled by his celestial teachers is only too under- standable to readers who have some experience of hypotheticalargumentation. That these teachers located Verbum vetustum in inac- cessible Great Tartary is evidence that their wisdom was as great as their love was fervent.T h e L o r d a n d H i s W o r d 187"

Even though it may sound paradoxical, it is possible to re-verse this statement. With the sublime freedom to understand theinner meaning of the Word, which the doctrine of correspondenceyielded him, the interpretation was in reality determined by the intel-lectual system he had already developed. The basic ideas in his theol-ogy had been worked out during his scientific period, and much in hislater evolution consists of explicit definitions of what previously hadbeen tentative thoughts. At the same time, his thinking after 1745 wasto some extent changed and simplified. With regard to his idea of God, we learned from the discussion of De Infinito (1734) that Swedenborg was extremely anxious to maintain a sharp and clear boundary between infinity and the finite state: he is-sued a special warning against false mathematical analogies beyondthis boundary and against identifying God with nature. When he ex-pounded his dogmatic universal theology in his last work, Vera Chris- tiana Religio, we find the same strict transcendence in his idea of God.God’s being is the substance and the form itself and cannot, therefore,be described with the aid of lower substances and forms, which aremerely obscure images of this supreme being. It is a mystery beyond allhuman comprehension; nor can the angels grasp the being of God,created and thus finite beings as they are. 233 If God’s esse(being) is inaccessible, it is, however, possible to un- derstand something of his essentia(essence) with the help of the two infinite attributes that are its foremost characteristics, love and wis-dom. Swedenborg regards these as the source of life, the spiritual sun—we recall from the celestial scenes in the memorabilia that heaven is constantly irradiated by a sun in the east, which thus repre-sents the Lord in the form of the light of wisdom and the warmth oflove. However, this spiritual sun, which is the prototype of nature’s inanimate source of light and heat, is not the only manifestation of theV i s i o n a r y S c i e n t i s t 188"

His first manifestation was when he pronounced the Word, as related in the first chapter of theGospel according to St. John, and thereby heaven was given humanform. 234The Word is also for the angels in heaven, which are shaped like human beings, and we know from the Old Testament that the Lordrevealed himself in human guise even before his incarnation. But thehuman race grew so remote from him through the centuries that amore radical manifestation was needed to restore contact, and finallythe Lord allowed himself to be born into the human world through amortal woman. 235 As a theologian, Swedenborg thus rejects both the concept of Christ as the Son of God and the doctrine of the Trinity. This is a moreradical approach than in De Infinito, where he regarded the Son as the connecting link between the infinite and the finite, but it does notimply any disparagement of the incarnation as such. It was God’s in-tention to defeat the power of hell and to establish a new church, buthis hands were tied by the eternal order which God himself had cre-ated. Therefore, God must act through humankind. By first assuminghuman form and then successfully resisting all human temptations, heallowed the human species to become godlike, so that the newcovenant could be established along completely new lines. This was thework of salvation, not the death on the cross—that God becamehuman and humans thereby God is the imperishable miracle. It is possible that Swedenborg was familiar with the kabbalic no- tion of Adam Kadmon, the original man, when he conceived his visionof the God-world relationship, or that he may have been inspired bysimilar ideas in other esoteric traditions. Nevertheless, the simplest ex- planation is that, through the doctrine of correspondence, he ex-panded the psychophysiological thinking of his scientific period. For,in principle, anima (the soul), which forms its body in the egg, is just as incomprehensible as the esseof the Lord, and the construction of the organism, like the divine act of creation, means that the spiritualtakes on material shape. The difference is, of course, that God createdthe universe from himself, while animais introduced in a pre-existing material in the egg.

While Swedenborg in Oeconomia Regni Animalis assumed a simple first substance outside all series, the divine essenow becomes the high- est series, in which everything created existed potentially before thefirst manifestation of the Lord. The number of degrees in each series is now set at three. These are, of course, discrete degrees, united through correspondence, and theyare related to one another as end, cause, and effect. The end first gen-erates the cause and then the effect in order to realize itself, and thistriad is repeated at all the levels of creation. Each effect becomes anend in a new series at a lower level all the way down to the lowest mat-ter, and the entire universal chain is held together with the help of cor-respondences. Only humans are conscious of this constant creativeprocess, and the primary end of creation can only be achieved throughthe coming into being of humans, who can bind together the ultimateand the first by acknowledging the universal teleology and by volun-tarily associating themselves with the divine. 236 Free will is obviously a cardinal point in Swedenborg’s thinking, as is true of Leibniz and Malebranche, the “philosophers of order,” who were his most likely sources of inspiration. The basic concept of a transcendent God beyond all human determinations, from whomemanates a cosmos which is irradiated by his force all the way down tothe most obscure reflections in matter, cannot help but remind us ofNeo-Platonism, and it is probable that Swedenborg himself made thesame associations. This does not mean that he consciously alignedhimself with Plotinus, but it qualifies him as belonging to the tradition often encountered under the name of philosophia perennis, timeless philosophy. The term suggests an intellectual current that maintains its iden- tity despite transitory ripples on the surface: in the Western world, theterm usually implies a Platonized interpretation of Christianity with pronounced mystical elements, and its great proponents include Ori-gen, Augustine, Dionysius the Areopagite, Eckhart, and many others.Among these, Swedenborg is known to have been deeply interested inV i s i o n a r y S c i e n t i s t 190"

We find serious differences of opinion between Plotinus and Swedenborg on the subject of freedom of the will and the origin ofevil, which exemplify the foregoing remarks. To Swedenborg, no mat-ter exists beyond that which is the final link in the golden chain andthus allied with God, and he therefore cannot identify matter with evil,as Plotinus did. In a memorabile, in De Amore Conjugiali , Martin Lamm discerned an attack on Plotinus’ theory that light in its utter-most emanation is lost in darkness; that is another way of saying thatgood is absorbed by evil. 237To Swedenborg it is quite clear that the only source of evil is humanity’s sin, which means that we have di-verted our love from God and thus from its ultimate end to our ownego. However, sin did not come into the world as the result of a singleact but through a successive rejection of God, a progressive love of self,a counterpart of the gradual loss of the science of correspondence. In this way, Swedenborg came to reject the notion of a revolt in heaven and a personal devil, ideas he had formulated in De Cultu et Amore Dei; and as a theologian, he gives humankind the entire respon-sibility for its own fate and thereby for that of the created world also.But, like all other advocates of theodicy, he was also compelled to takea stand on the question of the relationship of God to evil, once it hadarisen. The association with Malebranche’s idea of order is revealedmost clearly in his answer. God’s almightiness cannot be compared with that of a mortal tyrant, who can obey any personal whim; while God, in his love and wisdom, is order itself and can only do good. People have been given free will and must, by virtue of the divine order, be allowed to use itfreely. If we turn away from him, God cannot force us to change our attitude, but he can approach us with the warmth of love and light ofwisdom to the extent that we want to be near him: and God has pro- vided all people with good spirits, who will help them in the struggleagainst evil and will counterbalance the influence of the emissariesfrom hell. 238T h e L o r d a n d H i s W o r d 191"

Like other reformers, Swedenborg also preachesthe gospel of regeneration, but his version bears the stamp of the intel-lectual self-analyst. What he demands of people is that they searchtheir souls for their innermost motives, as he himself did in the criticalyears in the mid-1740s, and that they then consciously and activelycombat all the evil revealed by their self-analysis. To Swedenborg, a regeneration cannot take place through faith alone, as in Lutheran orthodoxy, nor as an immediate transformationof personality resembling the conversions of Methodism; like the Fall,it is a continuous process and expresses itself in labors of love vis-à-visGod and one’s neighbor: it also transcends death and comes to fruitionin the intermediate stage immediately after the body has perished.That which is regenerated is the inner person, and for those who, withthe help of the Lord, have succeeded in accomplishing the act of re-birth, the fullness of God’s love and wisdom pours into this inner per-son, and he or she lives under the direct guidance of anima, in the same way as the first people lived. Swedenborg had spoken nostalgi-cally of the bliss of the first humans ever since the preface to Principia in 1734; as an aging theologian, he at last was privileged to experienceit in his own life. But his lot was even more blessed. He was chosen to show his brothers and sisters the way to a realization of God’s great purposewith the creation.

In the new church, discord between faith and science would no longerplague a humankind whose frantic search for knowledge was so famil-iar to Swedenborg.

This request was received very gra-ciously: “Most willingly,” Swedenborg answered and added, “Besides, Ihad intended to send them there, as my purpose in publishing themhas been to make them known, and to place them in the hands of in-telligent people.”As they walked, the kindly and sprightly old man gavethe librarian a detailed report on the fundamentals of his theologicalsystem interspersed with entertaining glimpses of the spiritual world. 240Later, in the August issue of his periodical, Svenska Mer- curius, Gjörwell reported that all Swedenborg’s theological works hadbeen received by the Royal Library as a gift from the author. 241 This idyllic scene is characteristic not only of Swedenborg’s friend- liness and his sunny nature, documented by many of his contempo- raries, but also of the manner in which his ideas were disseminated.Gjörwell’s visit occurred a few years after the learned of Stockholm"

In aletter from the beginning of the 1760s, Swedenborg’s former assessorcolleague Daniel Tilas wrote that “the whole town” had recently buzzedwith talk about Swedenborg’s mystical talents, of which nobody hadever heard; due to the theological censorship in Sweden, the greattheosophical volumes had been published abroad anonymously. 242It was at about the same time that Swedenborg began to attract attentionabroad, particularly in Germany through Johann August Ernesti’s ex-tremely negative criticism and Friedrich Christoph Oetinger’s positiveand well-informed reviews. 243 Swedenborg never played the role of a sectarian preacher but relied wholly on his writings, which, of course, he hoped would reach as manyqualified readers as possible. Despite the prevailing censorship, he seemsto have had no problem in giving away copies of them in Sweden untilthe last few years, when the consistory in Gothenburg held a minorheresy trial of his first real disciples in the country. It was by no meansonly the Royal Library that received his books, but a long series of thetemporal and spiritual lords of the realm, with whom Swedenborgmaintained close relationships. Perhaps the foremost of them all, CountAnders Johan von Höpken, one of the most brilliant cultural personali-ties of eighteenth-century Sweden, was fascinated by Swedenborg’s the-ological philosophy and impressed by his intellectual gifts, thoughdoubtful of the value of the descriptions of the life of the spirits. 244 In attempting to sketch Swedenborg’s importance in the history of ideas, it is, of course, essential to differentiate between direct influ- ences, conveyed by various kinds of Swedenborgian societies and con-gregations, and indirect effects via individual literary works. Obviously, the two sometimes coincide; but, in general, the purpose of the many New Church congregations was to make converts within orwithout the existing Christian churches, while Swedenborg’s influenceon belles lettres is in no sense confined to those who wholeheartedly embraced his faith. The earliest effects of his authorship in Sweden can be divided roughly into two groups, which can also be defined geographically.V i s i o n a r y S c i e n t i s t 196"

It is true that this resulted in considerable unrest, even a heresytrial in Gothenburg; but, in general, Swedenborg’s rationalistic theol-ogy could be accommodated to the accepted doctrines of the Churchof Sweden; and it is remarkable how many priests in western Swedenwere in sympathy with Swedenborg’s teaching in the last decades of theeighteenth century and the nineteenth. 245 The other group had its center in Stockholm with strong ties to the tolerant court of King Gustavus III. As has been demonstrated in re-cent Swedish scholarship, it was of another type, occult and syncretis-tic in the sense that Swedenborg’s theories were found to provide arational explanation of all kinds of mysticism, from alchemy to animalmagnetism; indeed, the king was the last European sovereign to keephis own court alchemist. 246And it was in Stockholm in the middle of the 1780s that the first Swedish society for the translation and publica-tion of Swedenborg’s works was founded, the so-called Exegetic-Phil-antropic Society; it managed to get a few small sections into printbefore the authorities put their foot down. The ban was effected on the initiative of the church, but strangely enough it was supported by the radical advocates of the Enlighten-ment. This unholy alliance can be explained by the occult aspect of thesociety, which made it the target for journalistic attacks, the sharpestand most skillfully worded of which was written by the brilliant poet Johan Henrik Kellgren. 247In the eyes of the educated, Swedenborg came to be a symbol of folly and befuddled thinking, a stigma that hasstill not completely disappeared, even though the generation of writersthat succeeded him, the young romanticists of the first decades of the nineteenth century, did a great deal to correct Kellgren’s profoundlyunfair picture. However, it was outside Sweden’s borders that Swedenborg’s influ- ence was greatest: this was natural in the light of his own citizenship in the international republic of the learned.

But Oetinger did not determinethe German attitude, even though his support resulted in the publica-tion of collections of Swedenborg documents at a very early stage andin the translation of his works. It was a much more powerful spirit that influenced the German image of Swedenborg, namely, Immanuel Kant. He must also be givenmuch of the blame for the distortion of Swedenborg’s work that ariseswhen the entire emphasis is placed on the conversations with spirits.Kant was one of the first readers of Arcana Coelestia , and the experience made him extremely disappointed in the author, to whom he was favor-ably predisposed. It was in this mood that he wrote his biting attack, thefamous Träume eines Geistersehers (Dreams of a Spirit-seer, 1766). 248 The tract introduced Kant’s accounting with the principles of tradi-tional metaphysics which culminated in Critique of Pure Reason fifteen years later. Swedenborg’s admirers can thus find some comfort in thecircumstance that his negative influence had extraordinary effects. But Swedenborg’s importance to German intellectual evolution is not entirely negative, even though Kant’s scornful pamphlet made hisadmirers cautious and reticent. In a review of Lavater’s Aussichten in die Ewigkeit (Perspectives of Eternity) in 1773, the young Goethe ad- vised the later-so-famous physiognomist to study Swedenborg, super-fluous advice, indeed, since Lavater had been in correspondence withthe author of Arcana Coelestia, but it does reflect the reviewer’s positive attitude. 249Despite Kant’s one-sided and strangely ill-informed con- demnation, Swedenborg became an active force in German tradition,as one can see in Schelling’s, Görres’s, and other romantic thinkers’ in- terest in his theosophy. In G.H. von Schubert’s important Symbolik des Traumes(Symbolism of Dreams,1814) exhaustive quotations from Ar- cana Coelestia serve as illustration of the particular character of the language of dreams. 250 Sometimes Swedenborg was even included in the German tradition.

But his revolutionary spirit could not subordinate itself to anysystem, neither Swedenborg’s nor, even less, Swedenborg’s disciples’ in-terpretations of it. Instead, the most tangible reminiscences of Swedenborg in Blake’s poetry are in the form of parody and satire. The very title of his re-markable The Marriage of Heaven and Hell (1790) is a critical allusion to De Coelo(1758)—known as Heaven and Hell in English—which ex- presses the poet’s aversion to Swedenborg’s strict distinction betweengood and evil. The disposition is also a parody of the master: a Memo-rable Fancy concludes every chapter, comparable to Swedenborg’smemorabilia. Despite these defiant gestures, Blake received decisive impulses from Swedenborg, not least concerning the interpretation of the Bible;and his reading of newly translated works such as Divine Love and Wis- domand Divine Providence —a temperamental reading with pen in hand—aroused his need for a personal stand on problems of decisiveimportance. 256 William Blake is admittedly one of the most profoundly original geniuses in the history of literature, but his ambivalent attitude toSwedenborg can nevertheless be regarded as typical of the reactions ofthe poets. It is hard to find any great writer who accepted Swedenborgwithout reservation or who involved himself in any New Church con-gregation. Therefore, it is frequently difficult to determine Sweden-borg’s influence. Henry James Sr. overcame a severe mental crisis in the middle of the 1840s—a vastatioin Swedenborg’s terminology—as a result of being advised to read Swedenborg; the first works he read were those studied so thoroughly by Blake. This experience made James Sr. a faithful though independent disciple for the rest of his life. He published anonymously The Secret of Swedenborg and had con- tacts with Swedenborgian circles.

In the words of Henry James Jr., “The temple of Swedenborg stood in the centre of our family life.” What appears to have been of greatest concern in this temple was the morally activist aspect of the master’s teaching, the experience of thecreation as an unceasing progression toward the kingdom of God, thebelief that human beings can help to hasten the achievement of this goalby conquering egoism and attachments to the good things of this world.Neither Henry nor William James could share their father’s optimism oraccept his visionary master, but there is no doubt that they received in-delible impressions from the temple in the center of their family. This isparticularly noticeable in the older brother William, who himself experi-enced a vastatioresembling his father’s and wrote of it in his great work on the varieties of religious experience. 257 One of the James family’s closest friends was the great American author who drew what is perhaps the most important and most influ-ential of the many Swedenborg portraits in literature. When RalphWaldo Emerson published his famous collection of essays, Representa- tive Men(1850), he chose Swedenborg to represent mysticism. This essay has become such a standard work for the profane evalu- ation of Swedenborg that to read it is constantly to meet old acquain-tances. Emerson wanted to give an overall picture, in which thescientific period is attributed as much significance as the theosophical,and he was fully aware of the close connection between them. He alsoreproduced the intellectual milieu in a way that admittedly is not cor-rect in every detail but that, nevertheless, reduces Swedenborg’s origi- nality to reasonable proportions. And he treats the visionary aspectwithout dramatization, regarding it as an interesting psychical aberra-tion of relative insignificance in a larger context: to a reader who can make due allowance in the report for the re- porter’s peculiarities, the results are still instructive, and a more striking testimony to the sublime laws he announced, than any thatbalanced dullness could afford. 258 Emerson’s principal objection is to Swedenborg’s theological sys- tem, which, in his opinion, suppresses the symbolical interpretation ofN e w J e r u s a l e m i n t h e W o r l d 201"

Even what to Emerson was Swedenborg’sgreatest strength, namely, his gospel of love, suffers from this theologi-cal aridity. Though Emerson obviously read Swedenborg with consid-erable effort and with many reservations, the result was a tribute to thegreatness of the author, generously and gracefully expressed in theconclusion of the essay: Swedenborg has given mankind an intimationof the innermost harmony and bliss of existence, and the circumstancethat the radiance of what he had glimpsed had dazzled his own visionis only more powerful evidence of the glory of the drama. Emerson’s essay also opened the door to the world of Swedenborg for many people. For example, it was his fervent admiration for Emer-son—the third most-quoted author in his oeuvre after Goethe and Ni-etzsche—that led the remarkable Swedish poet and aphorist VilhelmEkelund (1880–1949) to begin to read Swedenborg at the end of1913. 259For Ekelund’s generation, however, there was a whole series of signposts leading to Swedenborg among the swarm of theosophicaland spiritualistic works, which were essential to the change in spiritualclimate at the end of the nineteenth century. In the English-speakingworld, the poet who expressed this renaissance of mysticism most bril-liantly was undoubtedly William Butler Yeats. However, his poetry hassuch profound and highly ramified roots in the hermetic tradition thatit is almost impossible to isolate Swedenborg’s influence; but Yeatshimself declared in a letter in 1915 that his foremost mystical authori- ties were Boehme, Blake, and Swedenborg. 260 In the general introduction to his writings as late as 1937 (pub- lished posthumously in 1961), Yeats avowed his belief in an “interpen- etration of natural and supernatural” and mentioned Irish folklore,spiritism, Swedenborg, and Indian religions as sources of wisdom for future poets. 261As William York Tindall and others assumed, it was probably Swedenborg’s doctrine of correspondence that fascinatedYeats; but it is clear, not least from the many passing allusions, thatYeats was moved by the scenes from the world of spirits, by the visions of the eternally young and eternally loving angels. 262Just after heV i s i o n a r y S c i e n t i s t 202"

I ameven persuaded that she is like those Angels in Swedenborg’s vision,and moves perpetually “towards the day-spring of her youth.” 263 It is unlikely that any of Swedenborg’s countrymen in that august as- semblage would have found the association as natural as Yeats did. Yeats gained his insight into Swedenborg’s theosophy in the course of his work on Blake’s Prophetic Books, which he published in 1893; and, as Tindall pointed out, his confrontation with French symbolistsdid not change his thinking but confirmed conclusions he had alreadyreached. 264Other modern poets, however, became interested in Swedenborg through nineteenth-century French literature. When theyoung hero of Balzac’s novel Louis Lambert, who has so many charac- teristics in common with the author, is introduced to Madame de Staëlin 1811, he is avidly reading Heaven and Hell. Balzac stresses that in those days it was only Saint-Martin, the renowned illuminist, and ahandful of other men of letters in France who had ever heard ofSwedenborg. 265This may be true of the period in question, but it does not mean that Swedenborg was unknown before that. On the contrary,his message had penetrated the French milieu as early as the 1770s through the intermediary of English and German writers, and many ofhis theosophical works were translated in whole or in part at an earlystage. 266 However, this early Swedenborgian influx coincided to a great ex- tent with the syncretistic mysticism called Illuminism in France. The best known and most important of the mystical societies had its seat inAvignon, where a former librarian of the Prussian King Frederick II,Dom Pernety, among others, developed a form of theosophy in which Swedenborg’s heavenly secrets were combined with elements ofN e w J e r u s a l e m i n t h e W o r l d 203"

The result was a brew that, for a time, was extremely attractive to quite a few peo-ple during the turbulent years of the revolution, and as Robert Darn-ton has pointed out, Swedenborg played a significant part in theunderground literature of the time. 267A disciple of Swedenborg was even a member of the dreaded Committee of Public Safety, and thenumber of Swedenborg societies in France increased during the firstyears of the revolution. 268 As in Stockholm, the associations with alchemists and practition- ers of animal magnetism eventually had disastrous effects on Sweden-borg’s influence, and the first wave of French Swedenborgianismreceded in the 1790s. Meanwhile, a new and more qualified interest inthe Swedish theosophist developed around 1820, partly as a result ofthe first complete French translation of his spiritual treatises; and it isto this that we can trace the literary influence of Swedenborg on VictorHugo, Lamartine, George Sand and—above all—Balzac. 269The pro- tagonist in Louis Lambert expresses the greatest admiration for Swedenborg’s doctrines, which undoubtedly agreed with Balzac’s own,at least in the 1830s. Swedenborg’s theosophy came to represent a de-finitive synthesis of all the religions of history. 270Thus, Balzac’s decla- ration of allegiance to Swedenborgianism as a religion did not imply abreak with the Catholic Church, but was an expression of his desire forsynthesis, his longing for a God for whom the physical and the spiri-tual are one and the same. In Séraphita(1835), Balzac moved one step further in the direction of Swedenborgianism than he had in Louis Lambert. 271In the latter book, he propounded the concept of unity on a theoretical level, whilein the former he gave it poetic form. The hermaphrodite Séraphitus-Séraphita, whose father Balzac identifies as a cousin of Swedenborg himself, is depicted against the background of a magnificent Norwe-gian fjord, together with three beings, each representing a different at-titude: the skeptical priest Becker, his loving and devoted daughterMinna, and the disharmonious romantic Wilfrid.

The novel is importantin evaluating its author’s realism, since it illustrates his belief in thesupreme unity, in the spiritual being represented in nature. With hisstrong physiological and psychological interests, Balzac is a true disci-ple of Swedenborg in the manner in which he experiences and ex-presses the conditions of humanity. 272 It is also through Balzac that the strongest Swedenborgian im- pulses were channeled into French tradition and thence disseminatedin many directions: we find traces of Séraphita everywhere in subse- quent literature. It was probably through Balzac that Baudelaire beganto read Swedenborg. This resulted in a temporary outburst of enthusi-asm, and Swedenborg obviously played a major role in introducing thepoet to mysticism. What primarily fascinated Baudelaire was the no-tion of correspondence, which became a cornerstone of his aestheticmetaphysics. As Michaud and others pointed out, even though Baude-laire did not actually create an aesthetic system, sensitive readers of hiscriticism and his poetry could not help discovering how close he cameto mysticism in his literary concept of reality: the state of poetic cre-ativity reveals the true reality, provides the contact with ideas and spir-itual forces within and beyond the visible phenomena. 273 Passages in one of his Poe essays (1857) reveal unequivocally that Swedenborg helped Baudelaire to orchestrate the theme: It is this admirable, this immortal instinct of the beautiful which makes us consider the earth and its spectacles as a revelation, assomething in correspondence with Heaven. The insatiable thirst for everything that lies beyond, and that life reveals, is the most livingproof of our immortality. It is at the same time by poetry and throughmusic that the soul glimpses the splendors beyond the tomb; and when an exquisite poem brings us to the verge of tears, thosetears are not the proof of excessive pleasure; they are rather evidenceof an aroused melancholy, of a condition of nerves, of a naturewhich has been exiled amid the imperfect and which would like toN e w J e r u s a l e m i n t h e W o r l d 205"

It is not bizarre details that Baudelaire borrowed from themaster, but Swedenborg’s total vision as a poet; and he felt that hisfunction as a disciple was to decode and translate nature’s hieroglyph-ics—an expression he often uses, possibly to associate with Sweden-borg’s own terminology. Baudelaire’s way of utilizing Swedenborg in his poetic universe be- came, to a great extent, the norm for his successors in the symbolistgeneration. Swedenborg’s name is frequently mentioned in the numer-ous manifestoes and declarations of principles—incidentally, the vi-sionary is even encountered in Breton’s first surrealistic manifesto in1924—and it is usually the artistic application of the doctrine of corre-spondence that is called for. Most striking, however, is that Sweden-borg is classified in the hermetical tradition in almost the same way asa century earlier. 276The explanation is the renaissance of occultism, which occurred in the wake of hypnotic therapy and the psychology ofsuggestion and which was of central importance in French intellectuallife around 1890. The frequent references to Swedenborg do not, how-ever, reflect any profound study of his works, which, of course, differradically from the efforts of the alchemists, the Rosicrucians, and thespiritualists. It is, nevertheless, symptomatic that August Strindberg first be- came a follower of Swedenborg in the full tide of this Parisian oc- cultism and under its direct influence. He himself relates in Inferno (1897) how he came to read Balzac’s Séraphita, an overwhelming expe- rience, even though he had already read it as a young man: Indeed, it proved absolutely new to me, and now that my mind was prepared for it I was able to absorb the contents of this extraordinaryN e w J e r u s a l e m i n t h e W o r l d 207"

There were others who were much better informed on Swedenborg’s worksthan Strindberg, particularly writers belonging to the romantic move-ment, and at least one of them adhered periodically to Swedenborgian-ism, namely, Carl Jonas Love Almqvist (1793–1866). To him,Swedenborg’s ideas of the lives of the dead, which he made use of inhis own scenes from the spiritual world, were tragically decisive in hisentire attitude toward humankind and toward life. 278 However, none of the romantic disciples of Swedenborg in Swedish literature has won an international reputation comparablewith Strindberg’s. According to Inferno, it was through the intermedi- ary of Séraphitathat “Swedenborg revealed himself as a spiritual men- tor in my life—in which he has played a tremendous role—and thus,on the anniversary of his death, he presented me with palms—whetherof victory or martyrdom who could say?” 279The date was March 29, 1896, but as usual Strindberg dramatized the incident: in reality, heprobably first became acquainted with Swedenborg twenty years ear- lier, when he was working at the Royal Library in Stockholm, whosedirector Gustaf Klemming had published the Journal of Dreams and was the patron of the young library assistant August Strindberg. 280 Reading Swedenborg’s works, nevertheless, had a decisive effect on the development of the crisis that had plagued Strindberg for severalyears, a religious crisis that coincided with literary sterility and com- pletely wild scientific speculations. Strindberg’s suspiciousness devel-oped during these turbulent years in the direction of clearlypathological delusions of persecution.

Swedenborg’s post- mortem inferno was for Strindberg his own daily life in Paris and inthe many other places to which he was driven during the miserableyears of the mid-1890s. Swedenborg’s doctrine of activity, the doctrine that man must struggle for salvation with his evil nature, was a lifesaver for Strind-berg, and he wrote in Legends(1898) that Swedenborg “has become my Virgil, who guides me through hell, and I follow him blindly.” 281But as could be expected, Strindberg also felt a need to free himself from thisteacher, as he had done with all the other great spirits who had influ-enced his life and work. In the fragment entitled Wrestling Jacob, at the end of Legends, his book of confession, he attacks the man who had saved him from the madhouse, and he does so in order that his soulshould not be injured by the elements in Swedenborg that are toohuman, too petty: So long as Swedenborg in the Arcanaand the Apocalypse treats of revelations, prophecies, interpretations, he has a religious effect upon me, but when in the Vera Religio he begins to reason about dogmas, he becomes a freethinker and Protestant.

I wish to have religion as a quietaccompaniment to the monotonous music of life, but here it is amatter of professional religion and pulpit-discussion—in brief, astruggle for power. 282 What terrified him, therefore, was mainly Vera Christiana Religio, and he bid a solemn farewell “with gratitude, as of one who, although with alarming pictures, had frightened me like a child back to God.”283 This farewell, however, was not definitive. About ten years later, when Strindberg published the first volume of A Blue Book, he dedi- cated it to “Emanuel Swedenborg, mentor and master”; the superficialreason for this was that Swedenborg’s remains were brought home toN e w J e r u s a l e m i n t h e W o r l d 209"

      "text": "Sweden and Uppsala Cathedral from London at the same time. Com- bined with the teachings of French occultism at the end of the nine-teenth century, influences from Swedenborg play a very important partin this strange book of reflections; and according to contemporarynotes in the so-called Occult Diary, Strindberg was still seeking relief from his own unhappiness in the theosophy of the visionary. It is clearthat the complex, somber sense of life portrayed in Strindberg’s laterdramas with such extraordinary power had profound roots in theworks of Swedenborg. As a religious body, Emanuel Swedenborg’s New Jerusalem has not achieved a large following. Nevertheless, his writings—and even moreso his aspirations and the vision on which they are founded—areamong the most remarkable in Western literature. The main purposeof my presentation has been to try to sketch the natural-philosophicalbackground of Swedenborg’s development and to indicate its roots inancient and Christian tradition and its relative agreement with con-temporary science. The portrait should have been given clearer con-tours, but it may nevertheless correspond to my high esteem for itssubject, confirmed by a host of witnesses infinitely more competentthan I. Through his ability to inspire writers who have exerted a majorinfluence on modern literature—Balzac, Baudelaire, Yeats, Borges,Milosz, and in Swedenborg’s ungrateful mother country, Strindberg,Vilhelm Ekelund, Gunnar Ekelöf, Lars Gyllensten, Kerstin Ekman, andOlof Lagercrantz—the scientist and mystic Emanuel Swedenborg isdeserving of the place of honor accorded to him by Emerson amongRepresentative Men. 284And more than two centuries after Sweden- borg at last was taken into the world of spirits that he described insuch detail and in such a fascinating manner, his inspiration is still a stimulus to research, still provokes controversy, and still serves as a source of consolation.V i s i o n a r y S c i e n t i s t 210"

In a very interesting essay on “Metaphysi- cal Poetry and the Poetic of Correspondence” in his Renaissance and Seven- teenth Century Studies (New York: Columbia University Press, 1964), 44–59, Joseph Anthony Mazzeo uses the term “the poetic of correspondence” to de-note a view of metaphor held among the theorists of the conceit (Gracián,Tesauro, and others) and looks upon it as a precursor to the poetic of Baude-laire: “Although the treatises of the conceit appear to have been little read afterthe seventeenth century, the theory of metaphor which they developed waskept alive through the occult tradition, and reached Baudelaire through theagency of Swedenborg. It is not an accident that the great analogical complex-ity of much modern poetry should have been largely the work of Yeats andBaudelaire, two poets who studied the occult sciences and who revived theconception of the poet as one who approaches reality through the discoveryof the analogies latent in nature” (Mazzeo, 58). It should be stressed, however,that Swedenborg never displayed any particular interest in poetics or the the-ory of metaphor; his doctrine of correspondence is primarily an offspring ofanother seventeenth-century tradition, the search for a universal language with the precision of mathematics. 132.

The author, who is one of Sweden’s most prominent critics, presents Swedenborg’stheosophy as a colossal poem on a more dignified human life. Among othersigns of an increasing Swedenborg vogue in Sweden may be mentioned thatSwedenborg’s De Cultu et Amore Dei was staged in September 1998 as an ora- torium by a theatre company in the provinces led by the young actress Mariaaf Malmborg.N o t e s 230"
