      "text": "FOREWORD Olof Lagercrantz is one of Sweden’s most famous writers and critics. He was born in Stockholm in 1911 and in his early adult years gained fame as a poet, poems that are still read and recited in Sweden. In1952, Lagercrantz received his doctorate in the History of Literaturefrom Stockholm University, writing his dissertation on another Swedishauthor, Agnes von Krusenstjerna (1894–1940). The complete bibliography of Lagercrantz’s life work to date includes hundreds of titles, ranging from full biographies to essays on a wide vari-ety of subjects. T wo of his major works have been translated and pub-lished in English: From Hell to Paradise: Dante and His Comedy(Washington Square Press, 1966), and August Strindberg (Farrar, Straus, Giroux, 1984). He has also written books on Nelly Sachs, Marcel Proust, Joseph Conrad, James Joyce, and George Orwell, and translated Izaak Walton’sThe Complete Angler (1653) into Swedish. His travel journals from theUnited States of America, the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republic,and the People’s Republic of China, have also attracted much attention.His high reputation as an author rests on a strange brilliance of style, hisdistrust of entrenched opinions, the originality of his critical perspective,and his conscientious research and broad learning. Of his later books,The Art of Reading and Writing (Konsten att läsa och skriva) has become a bestseller in Europe and has been translated into a number of differentlanguages. Most recently, Lagercrantz turned his attention to Emanuel Sweden- borg, another literary giant in his series of critical monographs. Being amodern literary scholar and critic, Lagercrantz approaches the works ofall authors as a sincere and careful reader, the texts being his field ofscrutiny and analysis. Secondary literature is of secondary interest tohim, and the use of biographical data or ideological and historical frame-work is subordinated to the actual words of the literary text.

      "text": "books, Lagercrantz has avoided the beaten track and has assiduously started from the beginning to guide himself through the work of the au-thor, ignoring what other people have told him about it, and never ledastray by any current opinion or scholarly standpoint whatsoever, search-ing for basic lines in the warp of the texture and clues to the heart be-hind it. In this way he approached the fourteenth-century work ofDante Alighieri, and this is still his method when studying Swedenborgas another great writer in the history of literature, one of the eighteenthcentury. For this reason, Lagercrantz’s study of Swedenborg is an original and very personal approach, quite unlike any earlier monograph or biogra-phy of Swedenborg, except possibly the unusual study published in 1915by a fellow Swede, Martin Lamm, another scholar from the same depart-ment at Stockholm University and one of Lagercrantz’s teachers. Lamm’sbook was later translated and published in German in 1922 and alsotranslated and published in French in 1936. It is a strongly positivisticstudy, demonstrating that there is a logical and consistent line ofthought development in Swedenborg from his earliest childhood experi-ences to his most mature theological statements. But what is perhapsmost remarkable about this work is that, in Lamm’s opinion, other-worldly experience is quite irrelevant to the conclusions reached; forLamm, Swedenborg’s claim that his theological concepts were largelybased on such experiences is simply something for those interested in theparanormal to investigate. Lamm’s concern was an analysis of the texts,and he approached them from the point of view of the history of ideas,finding that Swedenborg’s scientific work and his theological work werebuilt on the same set of ideas or the same kind of paradigm. As a scholar,Lamm tried to outline structure and to understand it. To believe in whatis written or not to believe in it is not considered as a matter of knowl-edge, and faith has never been the concern of comparativists like Lamm.Actually, a similar stand has been taken by all Swedish Swedenborgscholars from the department of Literature at Stockholm University:Martin Lamm, Olof Lagercrantz, Inge Jonsson, and Anders Hallengren,the translator of the present work.viii Foreword"

      "text": "Very much the same might be said of Lagercrantz, even though he long ago turned his back on the university to become a free writer be- yond all restricted views. He takes a long stride further, however, lookingupon Swedenborg as merely an author of literary texts, open to new in-terpretation. For instance, Lagercrantz declares: “I will read the works ofSwedenborg as a poem about an unknown country with strange lawsand customs.” And, “Call Swedenborg’s God that force that makes peo-ple rise from a gross material subsistence to seek a new and deeper senseof community. . . . Replace the term “God” with the everlasting longingfor something that braves time and death or that brings solidarity andjustice to the human race.” At the same time, Lagercrantz states sincerely that Swedenborg’s works contain an enormous amount of wisdom about the human beingand all the passions that shake us and make us human. Early in thebook, he reacts with bewilderment to Swedenborg’s “commission,” hisclaim that Christ appeared to him and appointed him to be a revelator.But the author then states, “I feel compelled to write this book becauseof what he wrote and taught after he endured this dream crisis.” A littlefurther on he writes, “Swedenborg guides us through a long series of ex-citing metamorphoses; his commentary contains suggestions enough tokeep a whole celestial academy busy with new ideas.” Lagercrantz did his homework. He clearly read deeply in Sweden- borg’s works before he began to write. His book deals concisely with agreat many fundamental Swedenborgian concepts, and he often insertsreferences to his sources. But he makes no claim to be a believer, a dedi-cated Swedenborgian, one who has accepted the faith of Swedenborg.Why? It is my conclusion that Lagercrantz fits quite precisely the definition of an adherent to “a twentieth-century philosophy—naturalistic humanism—a belief system that rejects belief in all forms of the supernatural; thatconsiders the greater good of humanity on this earth as the supreme eth-ical goal; and that relies on the methods of reason, science, and democ-racy for the solution of human problems,” as described in the Dictionary of Philosophy ( Littlefield, Adams & Co., 1968).Foreword ix"

      "text": "It is in this sense that Lagercrantz is so attracted to the wisdom he found in Swedenborg. Thus he pays high tribute to his fellow Swede time after time, while at the same time either denying his claims or mak-ing clear that he has no interest in where Swedenborg states he receivedthe wisdom that he wrote. Dedicated well-read Swedenborgians will findstatements here and there with which they may disagree. Or possiblythey will smile and conclude that the author just didn’t understand thepoint. The editors, in fact, may deem it advisable from time to time toinsert a footnote to clarify or to dispute a view expressed by the author.None of this, however, in my opinion, should be seen as serious flaws inthis often humble and candid tribute to one of the world’s greatthinkers. In many ways recalling Ralph Waldo Emerson’s striking pro-and-con essay on Swedenborg in Representative Men (1850), which was a starting point of Swedenborg’s literary reputation worldwide, Lagercrantz’s criticalessay, in its own way, testifies to the late recognition of Swedenborg in hisown country, where the interest in Swedenborg and his work constantlygrows. The name of Swedenborg, along with Saint Bridget, AugustStrindberg, or Alfred Nobel, is more and more considered an honor to hisnation, and Lagercrantz’s book has already passed two Swedish editionsdue to the demand of the reading public. Remarkably enough, Lager-crantz has put Swedenborg into a literary pantheon, alongside with DanteAlighieri of Italy and Marcel Proust of France. Something similar wasdone by Emerson, undeniably one of Swedenborg’s greatest Americanvassals, in his essay on “The Poet,” where he wrote, “After Dante, andShakespeare, and Milton, there came no grand poet until Swedenborg.” And so, we take a cue from Emerson. Read Epic of the Afterlife as a poem of praise by a poet of the natural plane to a poet of the spiritualplane. W ILLIAM ROSSWOOFENDENx Foreword"

      "text": "INTRODUCTION TO THE SWEDISH EDITION Emanuel Swedenborg was born in Stockholm on January 29, 1688, and died in London on March 29, 1772, at the age of eighty-four. At his death, few people knew of him. His reputation did not extend be-yond a limited circle of friends and readers. Today, however, our per-spective is different: no Swede has had a more profound influence on thespiritual world of humanity. Swedenborg was the son of the theologian and ecclesiastical politician Jesper Swedberg, who was later to become bishop of Skara, and his firstwife Sara Behm, both of whom had their roots in Bergslagen, the miningdistrict. When as an old man Swedenborg reviews his life, he neglects tomention his mother’s name. Maybe the reason for this oversight was thathe thought that the human soul is transmitted from generation to gener-ation by means of the sperm. Jesper Swedberg, an accomplished writer himself, with a remarkable autobiography among his works, overshadowed Swedenborg’s childhoodand youth. The Book of Hymns that Emanuel used throughout his life ended with his father’s prayer: Herre, signe du och råde och bevara nu oss väl.Herre, ditt ansikt i nådelyse alltid för vår själ.Herre Gud, dig till oss vändoch din frid oss allom sänd.O Gud Fader, Son och Ande,dig ske pris i allo lande! Bless and govern, O Lord, and protect us. May your face shine in grace before our soul.T urn to us and send peace to all of us.O God Father, Son, and Spirit, be praised in all countries! xi"

      "text": "The verse is still found in the Swedish Book of Hymns, testifying to an ardor that withstands time. Swedenborg studied at Uppsala, defended a thesis on Latin maxims, and devoted himself with the widest possible scope to philosophy and science. When he was in his twenties, he embarked on a five-year tour ofEurope, during which time he studied the known sciences. Young Swedenborg arrived in England when Isaac Newton was still alive, but thirty years later he was to meet the great scientist in the realmof the dead. At the time, England was in a state of rapid progress, scien-tifically as well as culturally, and was therefore a natural pilgrimage sitefor any young man wishing to broaden his horizons. In 1716, he returned to Sweden and, in due time, met with King Charles XII, who had, at long last, returned from his military campaigns in T urkey. The autocrat, whose favor the young man eagerly sought, would be caricatured many years later by the old theologian. The king appointed Swedenborg to be an associate member of the Royal Board of Mines, his commission being to lead and control the mining industry in the country. This appointment determined thecourse of Swedenborg’s life for the next two or three decades. He inher-ited shares in several mines, but, as far as is known, never experiencedany conflict between his own interests and that of the public. Indeed,Swedenborg was highly regarded as a zealous official. When he was en-nobled in 1719—a right of the bishop’s son—he inserted, into his coatof arms, the picture of a smoking foundry mound and one of the arrowsof Dalecarlia. At the same time, he let the syllable “Swed” in his ancestralname “Swedberg” grow into “Sweden.” Swedenborg the scientist and public official published comprehensive mineralogical works, one of them on iron and iron works, which wasthen the greatest industry of Sweden. Time and again, he traveled abroadto other European countries—saw France, visited St. Peter’s in Rome,and adopted England as his second home. Oddly enough, he lived inAmsterdam—the city of Spinoza and Rembrandt—from May 1739 toOctober 1740, without ever mentioning seeing a painting. But one ofxii Introduction"

Because of this revolutionary turn of events, he joined the ranks of theenviable few who break out of the routine of everyday life to start anew. From this crisis, Swedenborg produced a unique document: a journal kept from March 24, 1744, until October of that same year. Foundmany years after Swedenborg’s death, the manuscript was bought by theRoyal Library in Stockholm; national librarian G. E. Klemming inter-preted the text, which is difficult to read in its original script, and pub-lished it as a book entitled Swedenborgs drömmar 1744 . From Sweden, the extraordinary journal has spread throughout the world in a numberof editions. It is generally entitled simply The Journal of Dreams . The diary consists largely of dreams that Swedenborg records day by day, along with his attempts at interpretation.

An experienced traveler, a true European, he knows Amster-dam, Paris, Rome, and London; and in his future writings, images fromthese cosmopolitan centers appear repeatedly. Indeed, the youngSwedenborg lived for a while in London in the 1710s. In the early eigh-teenth century, Sweden was still a great power, ruled by the imperialis-tic Charles XII. The spirit of this age is crucial to the enormous ambitions Swedenborg cherishes all his life, particularly in the profun-dity of his claims. On his trips, Swedenborg usually carries a notebook in which he jots down short and rather dry notes. Contemporaries remark that he is some-what reserved—he completely fits the role of the government official—and few people manage to get to know him well. It may be that he feltill at ease in social gatherings because of a slight stutter. When we look at notes that Swedenborg made before he began recording his dreams, we see that, suddenly, in the middle of a sentence,the writing stops—empty pages follow. A couple of pages seem to havebeen torn out. Then, a year later, in an entry dated March 1744, thefollowing list appears, in strong contrast to the prosaic travel notes ofthe year before: 1. In my younger days, and the Gustavian family 2. In Venice, concerning the beautiful palace3. In Sweden, about the white cloud in the sky4. In Leipzig, on one lying in boiling water5.

      "text": "Epic of the Afterlife 5 Gunnar Ekelöf uses these mysterious words in his poem En Mölna- Elegy, calling them “wreckage on the shores of the dream,” an apt de- scription.2Swedenborg has apparently made notes of dream images that appeared to him important and shocking. After this list, the journal proper follows. It is written in Swedish, even though almost all of his other works, the scientific as well as thetheological, are written in Latin. But now, in his personal crisis,Swedenborg discards the formality of his Latin dress suit and of the re-strictions of academic language and speaks in his mother-tongue. Now,for once, he is not addressing an audience but writing for himself andfor no one else. Everything is simple, straight to the point. He is a manengrossed by an internal process. There is no room for the slightest re-vision or stylistic beautifying. The text is completely extraliterary—ifsuch a thing is possible. In one of the first dreams, Swedenborg says he is “in exstasibus vig- ilibus,” in a state of wakeful ecstasy. During these travels, he begins towrite in an exalted mood, a remarkable contrast to his former style. Thechange of places and constellations contribute to his anxiety and to hisvarious moods. During the entire period of his journal, Swedenborg begins to sleep more than usual, indeed, unnaturally much, every night—ten, eleven,twelve hours—a habit he maintains for the rest of his life. He has tor-rents of dreams, an endless procession of spectacular scenes, by turnscomical, ridiculous, pathetic, and moving, flooding in one upon theother. Usually, his dreams come at the moment of awakening, in thehypnagogic state between dream and wakefulness. This point is proba-bly what attracted Ekelöf, since the hynagogic state suggests that we cannever know for certain what is dream and what is imagination. From the very beginning of this crisis, Swedenborg regards his dreams as acts in a spiritual drama, a morality play of the soul, enactedespecially for his guidance. Dreams will remain an essential part of hislife, and he lies in wait for them as a hunter for his prey. He is nevercontent to regard them as amazing and inscrutable artifacts or fictive 2.

But whereas Freudthought that a dream can never be interpreted completely, Swedenborgincessantly searches for the Godsent elucidation, the absolute answer. Inthis quest, Swedenborg, the confirmed Christian, follows a biblical tra-dition, endeavoring to be a Joseph, the definitive interpreter of thepharaoh’s dreams. In his dreams, Swedenborg often finds himself riding a horse or in a carriage drawn by horses in dazzling harness. 3In one dream, huge windmills appear along the road, and he is hit by a sail, as happened toDon Quixote two centuries earlier. In another dream, with horror inhis heart, he tries to keep his balance while traversing mines on lad-ders. He walks on a footbridge over “depth and dangers”; he clings to arope; he is attacked by strange dogs. In dreams like these, we see shad-ows of his former life, when he inspected mines and forges as the asses-sor of the Royal College of Mines, an important position to whichCharles XIIhad appointed him, mining having been Sweden’s foremost industry at the time. From the very beginning of the journal, on his arrival at The Hague, Swedenborg writes that he has lost his “inclination toward women,” amotivation that, until this point, had been his “chief passion.” Wemight speculate that his passion has moved underground since, up tohis death, his writings exhibit a strong erotic sentiment. During themonths covered by the journal, women are constantly present in hisdreams, teasing, enticing, exposed in a variety of positions. In onedream, two women, one of them young, the other older, lie down on ei-ther side of him. He kisses their hands but doesn’t know which one tomake love to. On another occasion, a woman touches his penis, whichgrows bigger than ever, but collapses during penetration. In a horrifyingnightmare, he sleeps with a woman who has teeth in her vagina thatprevent him from entering. 6 Olof Lagercrantz 3. See, for example, dream entries 30, 197, and 279. [Ed.]"

He is searching for the symbolic meaning, although he duly notes the sweetness radiating from the women. The figure with thetoothed vagina represents, he believes, his scientific approach, a signthat he must go no further with this form of inquiry. That convictionemerges more and more, and he begins to chart his intellectual coursein a new direction. I see Swedenborg’s intense imagination as an unconscious protest against his excessive mental discipline. For decades, he had strainedhimself working on a tremendous writing project: he had tried to provethe existence of the soul through scientific evidence. At a furious speed,he pursued anatomical and physiological studies. In one dream, he lis-tens to a lecture in anatomy and waits to no avail to hear his name men-tioned among the authorities in this field. It is, thus, a dream ofdisappointed aspirations. He has begun to doubt whether he willachieve his scientific goal. Night after night, ghastly images of all kinds spill from his soul. “Sighs of dread,” a term taken from the book of hymns that his father, BishopJesper Swedberg, had edited, are now his daily fare. In dreams, he fights adark-gray snake. An executioner roasts disembodied heads, throwing theminto an oven. His dead brother Eliezer lies between two wild boars, whichfeast on his head. As is usual in dreams, the macabre mixes with the ridicu-lous and the amusing. So, in one dream, he dines out with a clergymanbut cannot get over the fact that he had to pay too much for the food. Tocover his loss, he covertly appropriates two silver bowls from the table. Af-terward he repents and racks his brains to think how he can return the sil-ver without anyone’s knowing. He interprets this dream in a pious way. I don’t think there is any other document like Swedenborg’s journal in Swedish literature, perhaps not even in the history of world literature.Strindberg, during his occult period, appears alert, sober, and clear-sighted compared to Swedenborg, who roves about in a fog of dreams.Fragments of reality and contemporary Swedish and European events in-tertwine with Christian thought.

Then, his father steps forward, wonderingwhy his son is making “such a fuss.” The historical allusions and theChristian terminology require footnotes for modern readers. Despite this,everything seems close to us because the circumstances, the excitement,the shape-shifting, the feeling of being pursued are all familiar. The journal describes the painful dissolution of a soul. Swedenborg is grateful for the grace bestowed upon him, but he is also fearful, as if he had been given a dose of a medicine too strong for his constitution. Heoften bursts into tears, although not tears of grief; rather they are tearsof heartfelt joy that the Lord has graciously given him. Hands claspedin prayer, he throws himself to the ground. He wakes up in anguish,with a cold sweat on his forehead. He questions the value of his scien-tific work, condemns his worldly ambitions, and feels the presence ofsomeone who will give him a new task. Even in his future life, Swedenborg often confuses dreams with imagination. But this is an important step because now he breaks freefrom science and enters into the realm of poetry. His dreams arepoems, still wild and rambling, still in a whirling chaos, but a cosmosis in the making. On April 6, 1744, Swedenborg is in The Hague; during the day, which was Easter Day, he receives Communion in a church in the city.That night he encounters Jesus face to face in a dream and thinks thatJesus must have looked like this when he walked the earth. Jesus smilesat him and asks if he has “a certificate of health” ( sundhetspass). Sweden- borg replies, “Lord, you know that better than I.” “Then do,” Jesus saysbefore departing. The journal entry concludes with the words, “Wokeup, with shivers.” This encounter with Jesus had been a dream. As spring 1744 proceeds through Ascension Day and Pentecost, Swedenborg’s anxiety grows. He vacillates between happiness and dejec- tion, between pride and doubt, and asks God for help.

In his journal,he writes that he is neither awake nor dreaming, but “in a strange tor-por.” The journey stimulates him, but he lives enclosed in his owndrama, and, with only a few exceptions, records nothing about the citieshe visits or the people he meets. Frankly, I cannot accurately depict what is happening to him. He seems close to the reader, as if he were present in the same room—the vitality of his words penetrate so deeply—yet what is going onwithin his mind and heart is obscure. I feel compelled to write thisbook because of what he wrote and taught after he endured this dream crisis. As Swedenborg continues his journey, it becomes increasingly clear to him that he should dedicate his remaining years “to that which ishigher.” He must leave his scientific life to devote himself completely tothe core of life: the love of the Lord. On May 1, he leaves The Hague and arrives in England three or four days later. Cosmopolitian London with its hustle and bustle surroundshim, but he is alone.

In a London tavern, in April 1745,Swedenborg sees a man sitting in a corner, who says, “Don’t eat somuch!” That night the same man comes to Swedenborg’s room, ex-plains that he is the Lord himself, and gives Swedenborg the task he hasbeen awaiting: he is commissioned to interpret the Bible. From that dayon, he tells Robsahm, he will write only on spiritual matters. “After-wards the Lord opened, very often daily, my bodily eyes, so that in the"

After all, when Rob-sahm speaks with Swedenborg, the elderly seer has lived for a long atime in his poetic world—for twenty-three years. On the other hand,perhaps Robsahm misunderstood him. In the Christian world, there is magic in everything concerning Jesus, and ordinary reason has no chance. The two appearances of Jesus haveformed an integral part of a Swedenborgian mythos that has had an im-pact on the way Swedenborg is viewed by posterity. Some scholars,Martin Lamm among them, have compared Swedenborg’s encountersto those of Teresa of Avila’s visions of Christ and have counted himamong the world’s great mystics. 5 I, however, think that another interpretation can be offered. The tor- ment of his heart and mind at the time of his dream crisis was a rite of pas-sage, a purification that led him to a new life. As he wrote in his journal ofdreams, he believes, according to the Christian rite of confession, that hehas overcome his desire for fame and has attained a child’s innocent faith.But might it not be that his longing for immortality, which he so ardentlysought in the field of natural science, has now been transferred to a newfield? The scientist, forced to obedience by the natural laws, is transformedinto an artist who is master over his world’s existence. The child that he be-lieves himself to be is succeeded by an authoritative teacher, not unlike his10 Olof Lagercrantz 4. Robsahm’s memoir of Swedenborg can be found in R. L.

According to his own testimony, it is de- rived directly from conversations with spirits. These communicationstake place in a specific state of consciousness that Swedenborg terms“being in the spirit.” This divine faculty was granted to him during thedream crisis, and that inspirited state of mind continues. He perceivesthat he is elevated out of his body; then the Lord, as well as angels andother spirits, talk to him. In this way, it was granted to him, he says, “tohear and see the wondrous things that exist in the other life, and whichnever before have been known to any human being.” In this lofty state of mind, Swedenborg’s doctrine is created. In an- other private journal that he began in 1747 and kept for almost twodecades, known as the Spiritual Diary , we can follow how his work pro- ceeds. This diary can be viewed as a continuation of the journal ofdreams, but without the chaos and the anguish of the former. The Spir- itual Diary almost exclusively records his inner life and his meetings with spirits. If something of the external world peeps through, it is re-flected as an image appearing in the spiritual sphere. In his work Angelic Wisdom concerning Divine Providence , Sweden- borg maintains that, in these exalted states, he receives knowledge di-rectly from God and rarely from angels or spirits. This information isdifficult to take at face value since his works are filled with angelic dis-course. The revelations of God are to be considered as feasts, whereasthe daily bread is something else. The diary is an endless feast of sucheveryday nourishment. The talks take place at night, in bed. Swedenborg still sleeps more than usual and will continue to do so, and dreams play the same deci-sive role they did during his crisis. In one of the more extensive dreamaccounts, Swedenborg, standing on a mountain, sees a ship drawn byhorses on the sea below. The helmsman/coachman steers the boat in cir-cles, and both horses and vessel are drawn under water. On deck, a manand a young woman are standing together with their child, andSwedenborg feels sorry for them.

They decide to punish the captain, who had reinedthe horses so carelessly, and tear him to shreds. This punishment didnot occur in the dream but in reality, Swedenborg explains. Thus,dreams here are blended with visions, and no one can tell one from theother. The spirits take part in the dreams and are active there. In an endless stream, spirits appear to Swedenborg. If they do not come, he enters their world himself and makes contacts. Some spiritsare benevolent, but others want to hurt him. Sometimes it is difficult tounderstand why he would call up such spirits, those impulses, tempta-tions, and oddities that occupy the internal scenes of our minds. Many spirits are people whom Swedenborg knew personally during their lifetime or people he knew of through conversations or throughreading. Now they manage to get in touch with him. He incorporates alarge part of the messages he receives during this period into his monu-mental exegetical work Arcana Coelestia (Heavenly Secrets), which he is writing during the same years that he begins the Spiritual Diary . It seems as if the diary served as a kind of sketchbook in this enterprise. Ina sober and clear manner, Swedenborg describes what is happening tohim. The breathless excitement of his accounts in the journal of dreamsis gone. As he becomes better acquainted with spirits and angels and be-gins to see them on a daily basis, he recounts his visitations in a naturaland simple style, as if neighbors were coming to his home, Hornsgatanin Södermalm in Stockholm. Despite this style, the impression of the Spiritual Diary as a whole is something like a wizard’s workshop, where spirits of all kinds emerge.There in the middle stands Swedenborg, like a Faust, preparing a spiri-tual composition intended for worldwide distribution. According to Swedenborg, in the Spiritual Diary §651, connection with the spiritual world can be established in four different ways. Thefirst takes place during sleep in moments when everything in a dreamappears before us as clearly as if we were wide awake. It sometimes oc-curs to us that, if this were really a dream, wakeful life might just as wellbe a dream, too. A second particularly receptive state occurs when we14 Olof Lagercrantz"

A similar transformation can sometimes occurwhen our eyes are open. That happened to Swedenborg two or threetimes. The third state of awareness can be enjoyed with open eyes; in thisinstance, the heavens and spirits present themselves in images—repre-sentations—although, for the most part, in symbolic form. The fourthkind of connection is established when the mind is separated from thebody and becomes “inspirited.” In this state, the visionary is fully con-vinced that he or she is awake and that all the senses are vividly alert. Insuch a situation, the person will not realize what has happened until af-terwards, when he or she returns to the state of normal wakefulness. This short survey presents features that may appear more-or-less fa- miliar. To some extent, everyone has had similar experiences, althoughwe do not refer to these phenomena as spiritual but rather psychological. In his diary, Swedenborg glides freely through his dreams, unim- peded as he passes to and fro. When he awakens, he longs to go back tosleep. When he is fully awake, he can be thinking so deeply that he de-bates with himself “on a specific subject, with vivid imagination” ( Spir- itual Diary §192.) The four states of awareness, as outlined above, could just as well describe a process of artistic creativity. Gunnar Ekelöfmakes use of his dreams in a similar fashion, allowing them to bemerged into the cast of conscious ingenuity. To Ekelöf, the hypnagogicstate of awareness is a natural point of departure that occurs when thelight in his studio is dim. Swedenborg repeatedly affirms that he can create the mental states necessary to receive the spirits in his abode. When he is guided throughheaven and suddenly is lost in worldly thoughts, the celestial locale dis-appears (Spiritual Diary §304). Every creative mind recognizes such a situation: propitious conditions are lost when an interruption occurs. Swedenborg’s visits to the spiritual world have been interpreted in various ways by critics and supporters, with undisguised hostility as wellas with sympathy and fascination.

They base their belief on Swedenborg’s reiterated assertionthat what is told in his writings is empirically tested reality. However, in 1766, Immanuel Kant wrote a book about Swedenborg, Träume eines Geistersehers (The Dreams of a Spirit Seer), critically exam- ining the visionary and calling him a daydreamer, utterly devoid of rea-son, the worst kind of idealist. Kant concluded that Swedenborg’sconversations with the dead were madness and illusion of a specifickind that frequently afflicts people who, like Swedenborg, are raised inthe belief in spirits and angels. Kant’s starting point was a few anecdotes circulating in Europe in his time, bearing witness to Swedenborg’s powers of communication. Afterhaving studied the Arcana Coelestia, he concluded that Swedenborg hadnot provided any tenable evidence whatsoever of a life beyond thegrave. With his pontificating, the whole matter was settled and the caseclosed, at least according to Kant. Anyone who approaches Swedenborg has some difficulties in getting rid of the Kantian problem of verity. When there is no incontestableevidence for life after death, we are often left with judging hallucina-tions, automatic writing, or pathological fantasies. But Martin Lamm,foremost among Scandinavian interpreters of Swedenborg, possessedan affectionate skepticism, calling the revelations of Swedenborg “ob-jectified manifestations of his own world of thought, being an uncon-scious continuation, in dreams and in hallucinatory form, of deliberatespeculation.” I find this description largely apt. However, Lamm’s expression “in dreams and in hallucinatory form” could be restated “in poetic form.”Already after a few months in Swedenborg’s world, I found that thequestion of truth was irrelevant to me. As with all poetical works, anyone is allowed to enter into Sweden- borg’s spiritual world. Time and again, he tells us how meetings withspirits take place. Spirits array themselves in Swedenborg’s shape, and heattires himself in spiritual garment. Spirits “play” human, but the spirits16 Olof Lagercrantz"

Evil spirits are his own sinister impulses, while angels, who violently resist evil urges, aremanifestations of a deeper level of consciousness. Thus, in his works, the life of the human soul is dramatized, with spirits and angels as actors and the reader as audience. Swedenborg in-vites us to a spiritual theater, where he plays the principal role. Hehardly ever turns to the audience in a confidential aside to ask, “Do youfollow me? Can you believe it?” We must take it or leave it; these are theonly choices offered. Compare this, for a moment, with an example taken from a world equally astounding as Swedenborg’s, one from the same century. Whenwe read Jonathan Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels, we doubt the existence of Lil-liputians and Brobdignagians and certainly doubt the universal wisdomof horses. But once we have entered into this world, Gulliver recountshis experiences with such self-evident authority that we suspend our dis-belief and enjoy ourselves. From this experience, we are offered a view ofour own world, seen from an unusual angle. Our pleasure comes fromwhat we recognize and from nothing else. We see ourselves in the strangemirror of Swift’s creation. The same applies to Swedenborg. Seen from this literary viewpoint, Kant looks like a man who wants to prove to Swift that giants do not exist and that his account, for thisreason, is fallacious. Because Kant based his analysis on hearsay and an-ecdotes, he believed that what he heard was presented as fact andshould be interpreted as such. Thus, Kant was lead astray, and, withhim, a large part of humanity, even today. It’s true that Swedenborgnever denied the accuracy of these anecdotes, one of which concerningan interview with a dead Dutch minister over a lost receipt attractedparticular attention. Nevertheless, in his published works, there are notraces of such clairvoyant stories. On the contrary, Swedenborg ex-pressly repudiated all kinds of “miracles.” I conclude my thoughts on the reality of Swedenborg’s spiritual world. Although the author himself may state that what he relates is thetruth and tell his friends about the visits of spirits, such conflation of thefictitious and the factual is found elsewhere in the history of literature.Epic of the Afterlife 17"

This“poem” occupied him for almost thirty years, right up to his death,taxing all his powers, constituting one of the greatest intellectual con-structions of Western literature. His works contain an enormousamount of wisdom about the human being and all the passions thatgoad us and make us human.

When his work is finished, the toweringpalace is standing there in all its splendor, high above us, shimmering inbrilliant colors and ornately embellished. This structure, however, is quite different from any palaces we know. It stands beyond space and time and surpasses our comprehension. Toenter, we must keep close to Swedenborg, our cicerone. When the human body wears out, it dies. But when our heart ceases to beat and our breathing stops, the inner “I” continues to exist in an-other dimension. This “I” is called spirit, and no one on earth can see it.In its spiritual form, the human body retains all its features, although itis now made from a substance the exact nature of which Swedenborgcould not identify with certainty. The spirit can see, hear, and feel. Ithas a stomach, a liver, even a bladder, and knows hunger and thirst. If the spirit did not have a body, it would be something insubstantial, a phantom, a chimera. A spirit cannot exist without form, and thisform is human, as is obvious to anyone who is familiar with Sweden-borg’s conception of God. Swedenborg treats the usual Christian pic-ture of eternal life with scorn. The belief in life after death is part andparcel of the Christian faith. According to the current funeral rite of theSwedish church, “all people will, after having rested in their graves, onJudgment Day be resurrected to eternal life.” In Swedenborg’s time, theclergyman said at the burial service: “Earth to earth, dust to dust; JesusChrist, your Savior, will resuscitate you on the Last Day.” But Swedenborg questioned this. If the dead will not be revived until doomsday, where are they meanwhile?: Are the souls of Adam and Eve and all who have lived since dur- ing six thousand years or sixty centuries still flying about theuniverse, or are they kept shut up in the center of the earthawaiting the last judgment? What could be more painful andwretched than such a wait? Might not their lot be compared tothat of men bound in chains and fetters in prison? If such werethe lot of man after death, would it not be better to be born anass than a man? Moreover, is it not contrary to reason to believe20 Olof Lagercrantz"

Can such a new body beput on a skeleton that has been burnt up by the sun or reducedto ashes? True Christian Religion §693 Swedenborg’s poem of the life that begins immediately after death is a handsome counterbid. , The newcomer in the spiritual world is received by two angels and two spirits. The angels sit silent beside the head of the deceased: angels donot “talk” but communicate through thought. They give the dead a newface, even two, since the angels are couples. When the angels perceivethat their faces have been received, they understand that the person isdead. Minute details in the features, around the lips and the eyes, are im-portant. On the other hand, the two spirits represent infernal forces,constituting a dark opposite to the angelic power. On a few occasions, Swedenborg witnesses the awakening of a soul. He smells the aromatic odor of embalming because, when angels arepresent, the cadaverous becomes fragrant. Sometimes he sees friendsand relatives rush to greet the recently arrived soul. All are welcome and are carefully attended. The person now under- goes a probationary period, at the end of which his or her final destina-tion will be determined: heaven or hell. At first, new spirits are a bit dazed and confused because everything is new to them. A vast new world extends before them. Although it issimilar to our world, there is one important difference. Even thoughthere are cities, countryside, forests, deserts, mires, and huge castles,everything is mobile and transient. Let us suppose for a moment thatwe were, like Swedenborg, allowed to enter into the spiritual world. Weapproach a little town with an ordered street system and well-builthouses.

The town was the creation of the trav- eler’s imagination, the materialization of a thought, which dissolvedwhen we thought of something else. When Strindberg grew older, he became acquainted with Sweden- borg’s work and was so inspired by what he read that his own writingmade a leap forward. Swedenborg released Strindberg’s imagination andanimated his world; in this spirit, A Dream Play and Inferno were pro- duced. In A Blue Book , which Strindberg dedicated to Swedenborg, “the teacher and the leader,” Strindberg too describes the spiritual world. Herelates that all that the angels perceive appears to be created by them-selves. This is obvious to them since everything disappears after theyleave. When other angels come by, things take a different shape accord-ing to what the newcomers think. But to return to Swedenborg’s explanation, the recently arrived soul soon overcomes its sluggishness. After an initial dimness, vision gradu-ally becomes sharper than ever. In one episode ( Spiritual Diary §4354), Swedenborg observes a young, beautifully dressed woman accompanied by a child, five or sixyears old, going into a garden. The moment they enter, the decoratedportal, adorned with beautiful flowers, gleams with a sparkling light.Someone tells him that young girls think they are adorned in a similarmanner and get new clothes according to their behavior. But neither thegarden nor the dirt road, which they are walking on, is real, and neitherare their clothes, Swedenborg explains. Yet the experience is more real,alive, and vital than any garden in our world. Swedenborg guides us through a long series of exciting metamor- phoses; his commentary contains enough suggestions to keep a wholecelestial academy busy with new ideas. In his company, we strollthrough magnificent landscapes; but then, suddenly, evil thoughts turnup and, with them, everything changes into a morass with crocodilesand serpents.

So in the very act of thinking of a person causes his or herspirit to appear instantly. Swedenborg relates [True Christian Religion§797] that, when Luther’s friend Melanchthon arrived in the spiritualworld, he was at once given a house similar to his home on earth. Hisstudy was an exact copy; there was even a book shelf on the wall, filledwith rows of his own books. Melanchthon sits down at his desk.

Similarly, in the world of spirits, architects do not design buildings; the houses change according to the inhabitant’s moods.

But if his thought doesn’tsolve the problem, the house shrinks, and all of a sudden, the spiritfinds himself standing in the street, begging for bread. , Spirits usually appear in full daylight. The Hades of classical antiquitywas dark, and many still envision blackness as pervading the nether-world, with countless ghostlike beings, sprites, demons, and ghoulscreeping about in the dark. Swedenborg, however, rejects all such beliefwith contempt. In this respect, he subscribes to the eighteenth-centurycult of reason, a man of his time. Unlike James Joyce, Swedenborg didnot collect folklore when he created his kingdom of the dead. If Sweden-borg’s spiritual world can be compared to anything at all, it is to Ely-sium, the isle of the blessed as described by Homer and Hesiod, a placeat the ends of the earth where favored heroes are brought after death.Swedenborg himself alludes to this mythological paradise when he allowssome spirits to compare their heavenly lives to the happiness in theElysian fields (Spiritual Diary §1232). Considering the unusual character of Swedenborg’s spiritual world, it is not surprising that misconceptions have arisen. If angels havemouths, stomachs, kidneys, intestines, spleen, and an appetite for food,where does the defecation go in the city of souls? The answer is simple: everything in the other world is spiritual and appears in the image of a recognizable and understandable object. Thereis no need for bakeries and toilets. The spirits are not oppressed by wor-ries about making a living. In that respect, they remind us of Sweden-borg, who was economically independent and was able to subsidize the24 Olof Lagercrantz"

They emerge out of his consciousness, and he lends them his body and senses. In-deed, Swedenborg emphasizes that the bodies of spirits are exact dupli-cates of human bodies, and their urge to satisfy desires promotesspiritual life. For example, hunger is a craving for the nourishment ofrighteousness, while the thirst for wine signals a longing for the water ofeternal life. In other words, sensual needs signify something higher onthe spiritual plane. Earthly drives are transformed into spiritual inclina-tions. Evil spirits undergo a similar change but go in an opposite direc-tion; they feast on revenge and malice. Although we can view Swedenborg’s spirits as a creation of his own psyche, sometimes they become so lively that even he finds them diffi-cult to handle. In Spiritual Diary §3157, Swedenborg extends his handto greet a spirit. The latter, who remembers this earthly custom, recip-rocates the greeting, believing that Swedenborg’s body is like his own, aspiritual body. But the handshake takes place only in the spirit’s imagi-nation, since he has no body that can interact with mortals. As an analogy, let’s say that, when Leopold Bloom, in Joyce’s Ulysses, fries his breakfast kidney—and burns it—and then takes the tray withtea upstairs to his wife, it is Joyce carrying the tea tray because he hascreated the scene. Now, if Joyce the author had encountered Bloom thecharacter on the steps, Joyce could not have extended his hand to touchhis creation, since he would be ensnared by his fictional wordnet.Swedenborg, on the other hand, can act as creator and created at the same time. On one occasion, when Swedenborg approaches a group of debating spirits, he is stopped. “I was astounded,” one of them says, “to see that,when you came closer to us, you were sometimes visible, and sometimesinvisible. Obviously, your state of existence differs from ours.” Swedenborg answers, smiling, that he is neither a magician nor a mi- rage. His nature is dual.

In the Spiritual Diary §4315, Swedenborg recounts a meeting with comic actors in the spiritual world, who aroused his sympathy becausethey have mastered the art of imitation so cleverly that the spectatorthinks that all the actors appear to be is real. In their particular angelicsociety, actors serve as mediators because analogies and correspondencesare to them matters of course. And returning to the contemporaneity ofSwedenborg’s descriptions, we are reminded that, in London, at theDrury Lane Theatre, he might have seen the famous David Garrick,foremost among contemporary actors. In an excellent study, Carl-Göran Ekerwald points out that the spir- its Swedenborg sees are never given any detailed description. 1Their in- clinations—their loves and hates—attract Swedenborg’s attention, butwe rarely are told what they look like. After all, it would be interestingto know the color of St. Augustine’s eyes. To ask for such things is blas-phemous, however, because, in the spiritual world, the inner life is thefocal point, revealing the true nature and leading to a heavenly or hell-ish existence. How much of our earthly existence is transferred to the afterlife? Swedenborg states that all in our earthly life is revealed after death.Everything is filed in a tremendous memory archive. However, triviaand incidentals soon fade away, and the internal life of the soul comesforth. Swedenborg confesses to his spiritual friends that he fears that hecannot adequately communicate the notion of a God separate fromtime and space relationship. However much he tries, nature pervadeshis thought. For this reason, to expect exact information is often askingtoo much of him. But as it happens, he sometimes contradicts himself. The depiction of the spiritual world is, after all, an attempt to trans- late the inscrutable. Human beings are not entirely incapable of grasping26 Olof Lagercrantz 1.

From this kind of comment, I get the impression that Swedenborg is aware of his creative imagination but, from time to time, enters into hisworld completely and behaves as if he lives on earth and in heaven. In-deed, he may have believed this to be the case on those occasions whenhe claims dual citizenship. Frankly, I don’t know whether Swedenborg thought that what he wrote should be interpreted symbolically, in the same way he read theBible, or should be understood literally. Everything he writes is basedon his doctrine of correspondences, and all his writings are enlivened byhis ability to find similarities and to draw conclusions from parallels be-tween worldly and heavenly things. We are all left to choose the mean-ing as we see it. This ambiguity is, I think, an important trait in Swedenborg’s writ- ings: the belief that the spiritual world exists in a concrete sense bal-anced by the conviction that it is really symbol and sign, an imaginarypicture of great significance. As his disciple Strindberg does in Inferno,Swedenborg legitimizes his account by repeatedly pointing out the au-thenticity of his narrative, although he just as often underlines the sym-bolic character of the scenes. The author himself sometimes acts as an emissary between the spiri- tual world and our earthly life. Sometimes he does so with a bitter senseof humor. Christopher Polhem, the ingenious inventor with whom Sweden- borg had collaborated and whom he admired greatly, died on a Mon-day; but, on Thursday of the same week, the departed Polhem talkedto Swedenborg who then happened to be “in spirit.” Polhem was per-mitted to use Swedenborg’s eyes and thus could see his own coffin inthe church. The astonished inventor asked why he was buried when hefelt he was still alive. This incident is reported in a smug fashion because Polhem was an atheist and did not believe in life after death, as he had often pointed outto Swedenborg. In the spiritual world, Swedenborg gets the last word.Epic of the Afterlife 27"

Godloves what he has created, even those who reject him and choose evil.God is like the mother bird who warms the newly hatched nestlings,taking them under her wing and sustaining them from her own sub-stance. The divine love of God operates in soulless things as well—intrees and herbs, in minerals and stones. Everything emanating from God bears the stamp of the Divine, and everything has a double meaning. The doctrine of correspondences isbased on this conviction. Things, people, even words have a counter-part in the other world. Nature as a whole is a setting full of meaning"

This doctrine, deeply rooted in the history of humankind, is devel- oped from simile and the analogy of opposites. From an earthly pointof view, Swedenborg expounds the nature of heavenly things; and froma heavenly perspective, he understands the earthly environment. According to the theory of correspondence, nature is a picture book where something of higher value and deeper meaning is concealed inevery object, which represents that higher value. Swedenborg observesthat, when children play, they regard even stones as living beings. Thus,it is clear to them that nature is animated. I once heard Ingmar Bergman say in an interview, “For me, the movie has been a marvelous means of breaking walls and roofs.” Longbefore that imaginative medium was invented, Swedenborg createdconditions that made it possible to smash through the veil of reality ina similar manner. Today, film can reproduce the spiritual environment;but long before there were motion pictures, writers like Goethe,Almqvist, and Strindberg drew on Swedenborg’s conquests. The bilingualism of creation also includes the book God wrote, the Word, always capitalized by Swedenborg. Yet even the Word can begrasped on four different levels at the same time, Swedenborg asserted,as so did many learned men before him. The doctrine of correspon-dences provides him with a key to the Word; and when that key is givento him after the dream crisis, he begins to write it all down, and he con-tinues to reveal the secrets of this God-given book up to his death. , Swedenborg’s interpretation of the Bible is a colossal enterprise, almostsuperhuman. Its size is not for ordinary people but for giants.

Some letters, such as “f,” “g,” and “s,”have an extended downstroke, almost ornamental like a decoration.Sometimes he lets the upstroke of a “d” sweep back to cover the wholeletter like a veil. But these features do not seem to me to be the essenceof his script; to me, his handwriting indicates will rather than feeling. Swedenborg states that spirits occasionally guide his hand and that his handwriting changes in accordance with the spiritual society he ispresently visiting (Spiritual Diary §2962) One biographer, Signe Toksvig, calls this phenomenon automatic writing and presents a few ex-amples. 1The changes seem to me too minor to deserve much attention.30 Olof Lagercrantz 1.

After all,Columbus discovered America in this way. Swedenborg is convincedthat the Bible is the Word of God and that its books are written incode. The Bible is the connection between earth and heaven, betweenthe cosmos and humanity. To some, this may appear as folly, butSwedenborg proudly replies that the Bible is a treasure chest filled withdiamonds and rubies, and he will show them to you. The words in theBible are shadows of heavenly words, and he shall offer them to you. Hekeeps his promise. From the viewpoint of modern hermeneutics, Swedenborg’s method of interpretation is immediately recognizable. Anyone who is concerned with textual analysis shares Swedenborg’s belief in hidden meanings. The ideathat every word has a secret signification is not preposterous. Swedenborg,however, pushes the hidden message of Holy Writ very far indeed. His rad-ical exegesis is astounding. The essential duality is applied to all episodes,all names of people and places, every word, each and every letter. The Bible is, as we now know, the work of many different authors. Swedenborg, however, takes it for granted that one author wrote it all,namely, God. He makes a few exceptions, remarkably enough one ofthem being the Song of Songs, the erotic outspokenness of which com-petes with his own dream journal images. Without any explanation, hedeclares that the Song of Solomon lacks internal meaning and thus wasnot written by God.

It culminates in God’s final appearance in humanform: Jesus Christ. All prominent prophets and biblical figures whoprecede Jesus are to be regarded as sketches, drafts of the final picture.God seems to be outlining the picture. He creates figurae, behind which the divine pattern is visible. This method of interpretation is more or less applicable to the works of any human author; but it is particularly fruitful when applied to theWord of God because, despite the Bible’s apparent variety, it has comeinto being within an old and uniform tradition. , Swedenborg’s starting point is the assertion in Genesis that God createdhumankind in his image. Thus, when we study the image, the Divinecomes into view. When Adam alighted from the hand of God, he was perfect and god- like. Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden spoke with God as an equal.Even Abraham still saw God as human. Why don’t we all radiate a divine light, then? The answer is that hu- mankind forgot its origin and now retains only a dim recollection of it.In small children, our true source peeps through. Infants are uncon-scious and innocent, and adults respect their proximity to the Divine.When we grow to adulthood, God withdraws into himself, but the di-vine origin invisibly remains. This remnant constitutes our real life, thesoul, our internal and immortal being. Without a soul, we would be-come beasts and descend into madness. The meaning of life is to return to what we were. The body is made to be a receptacle of the Divine, and it longs to be filled up by the Lifethat once was there.

We must awaken the po- tentialities—the kingdoms within—to become angels. “Angel” is one of the most common terms within Swedenborg’s works. The word—angelus in Latin—confuses us. To many of us, angels are winged beings from childhood stories. The religious consider themas glorious figures like the archangel Gabriel who startled the VirginMary or the archangel Michael who walks on water and dispels devils,as he does in Dante. John Milton dominated the literary world of the eighteenth century. There is ample reason to believe that the young Swedenborg was en-chanted with Paradise Lost. 3Winged angels of superhuman size appear in that epic, first and foremost among them Satan, the angel of light,Lucifer, whose pride caused his fall and who from the depths of helltries to reconquer heaven. But Swedenborg’s angels are neither fabulous nor heavenly super- men. No angel was created before humankind, and no angel is our su-perior. In Swedenborg, angels are common people: they look like us,and they have lived on earth like us. After death, they have passed aphase of ordeal and become purified enough for fulfillment in heaven, asort of rite of passage. If they pass through the three stages of heaven,they reach God. , Swedenborg’s Arcana Coelestia is difficult to read. Frankly, I am in- clined to say that it is almost impossible to get through the entirework. This is partly due to the enormous size and partly to Sweden-borg’s microscopically close reading, slowly inching from paragraph toparagraph of the biblical text, not leaving a single word without com-ment.

Whatever God writes—“prince” or “rainbow” or “sea” or “wind” or “horse” or “tree” orsomething else—Swedenborg consults his biblical dictionary and tells usof all the passages where these words are used. The Arcana becomes a shower of sparks that bind the words and the episodes together, but themultitude of meanings can be perplexing, even exhausting. Even whenthe Bible rattles off long lists of names and pedigrees, Swedenborg main-tains that there is an inward meaning concealed behind each. It is possible that those who know the Bible more or less by heart— and they were many in Swedenborg’s time—are capable of enjoying theigneous flow through passage after passage of the sacred text and imagi-native sparks being kindled by the array of combinations. Some Proustscholars work in the same ésprit, and their research will be stone-deadthe day À la recherche du temps perdu is no longer read. The reader of the Arcana faces another difficulty: when Swedenborg himself is not able to decipher the internal meaning, he asks the angelsfor advice and receives advanced clarifications, which, of course, thereader cannot verify intellectually. In this way, Swedenborg keeps us outof his assignment. He informs us that trees signify knowledge about thegood and the true, that sheep denote gentleness. Unfortunately, whenwe are forced to accept these renderings as fact, with no questionsasked, the tree withers away in our mind and the sheep lose their wool. Of course, even Swedenborg observes that the strict definition of word to symbol cannot be maintained. Seven cows in the dream ofPharaoh signify truths when they are fat, but signify falsities when theyare skinny. The lion in one instance is divine truth, but the next mo-ment, it symbolizes destruction. Swedenborg has to keep the door wideopen for divergent interpretations. I imagine that, as author of the Bible, God would quite likely have been a bit proud of his ability to captivate readers by a variety of fasci-nating fates and adventures: for example, Noah’s Ark, which conqueredthe flood of destruction and the rainbow God arched across the sky asa promise; or Samson, whose power was in his hair and his belovedDelilah, who led him to destruction.

Had God seenthe result of Swedenborg’s endeavors, he might have regretted givingthis assignment. Swedenborg is aware of the problem, however. He does not deny that both the literal and the internal meanings are important and should becarefully considered. When he principally dwells upon the internal sense,the reason is its novelty and doubts about this sometimes cross his mind. For example, in Arcana Coelestia §5492, Swedenborg tells the story of Jacob’s sons, who traveled to Egypt to buy grain. Suddenly, he inter- rupts the narrative and addresses the reader. Is it really possible, he asks,that the trivial statement “the sons loaded the grain onto their donkeys”contains a higher truth? He answers, of course, that the angels read thewords in another way than we do. But I find Swedenborg’s hesitationnoteworthy. In another instance, he discusses, with what I regard as obvious anx- iety, the construction of Noah’s Ark and its measurements, as described in the sixth chapter of Genesis—three hundred cubits in length, thirtycubits in height, and so forth. If this should be understood literally,there would be no spiritual or heavenly meaning at all in this passage,only something historical of no more importance than various mattersdescribed by profane writers. A spiritual meaning is required. Not surprisingly, few readers were attracted to the Arcana when it was published, despite the fact that the author gave away copies. Even today it is read by very few, and then mostly for the sake of certain passages—the conversation with angels, the sensory impressions afterdeath, life on other planets, or the Grand Man. Swedenborg’s persistent ambition always to find the internal sense re- peatedly leads him out into deserts of desiccated diction. But during the few moments divine guidance seems out of reach and he ventures a per-sonal interpretation, he is brilliantly successful and arrives at remarkablefindings. ,Epic of the Afterlife 35"

      "text": "In the Old Testament, nobody better illustrates the course of the Divine becoming human than does Abraham in the eighteenth chapter of Gen-esis. On a hot day, while Abraham sits at the door of his tent in theterebinth groves of Mamre, the Lord comes to visit him in the shape ofthree angels. There follows an episode stored forever in the memory ofour civilization. The Lord tells Abraham that he is going to destroy Sodom, the city of sin. Abraham asks anxiously, “Will you also destroy the righteouswith the wicked? Perhaps there are fifty righteous in the city. Will younot spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous? Be it far from youto do this, to cause the righteous to die with the wicked, so that therighteous be as the wicked; be it far from you! Should not the Judge ofthe earth be fair?” Then begins the famous bargaining. God consents to spare Sodom for the sake of the fifty righteous. Straight away, Abraham lowers thenumber to forty-five, then to forty, thirty, twenty, and, finally, ten. TheLord yields and promises that if, perchance, ten righteous can be foundin the city, he will not raze Sodom to the ground. Swedenborg shows that this scene may not, under any circumstances, be taken literally. God is Mercy itself, not the cruel destroyer who ap-pears here. Rather, God is outside and above this haggling, dreading theoutcome. Since Abraham represents the Divine, he is arguing with himself. The bargain in the terebinth grove is an internal conflict, an attempt tocome to terms with his conscience. Abraham disarms himself and hu-manity, thus temporarily warding off the threat of mass destruction. Atthe moment he flings the weapon from his hands, he is nearing the mo-ment when Jesus overcomes human limitations and becomesGod–Man. God is the vital force inside the mortal. Our destiny is to return to our divine root. Abraham resumes his “godbecoming” when God com-mands him to sacrifice Isaac, his only son, the barbarous bidding of abarbarous god. According to the biblical letter, God changes his mindat the last minute and sends a ram instead to replace Isaac on the altar.36 Olof Lagercrantz"

Abraham asks himself, “How could I be so foolish to follow the de-cree of a primitive god when I possessed the memories of another andhigher God?” He refuses to obey the tribal god, who requires humansacrifice, and thus he advances toward participation in the divine na-ture. It’s a pity that Kierkegaard had not read Swedenborg, when, inFear and Trembling, he wrote his acclaimed interpretation of the Abra-ham episode. There Kierkegaard would have found a higher message. When Swedenborg arrives at the beautiful and affecting episode of pharaoh’s daughter’s finding the basket made of reed where baby Moseslies crying, he discerns a figurative representation of Jesus. The baby’smother, fearing that the cradle of reeds would leak, has caulked it withpitch and tar. In his concordance, Swedenborg finds that pitch and tarsignify something bad. Thus, he states, this indicates that, from a poorbeginning, the child Moses in the basket will, like the infant Jesus in themanger, rise to save his people. Of course, Moses is born in Egypt, andthis alludes to the flight from Herod and the saving of the child Jesus.When the princess feels pity for the crying child and is filled with com-passion, the Divine within her is awakened; as we know, her father haddecreed that all newborn male Hebrew babies should be killed, so herdefiance is not without risk. In the course of time, when Moses hasreached adulthood and is tending the sheep of his father-in-law Jethroin the desert, he one day arrives at Horeb, the mountain of God. TheLord’s angel appears before him in a flaming bush; the fire burns with-out being consumed. Curious about the unusual phenomenon, Mosestakes a closer look. The text tells us that when God saw that Mosescame closer, God called his name twice, and then Moses responded,“Here I am.” God then commands, “Don’t come nearer; take yourshoes off because this is sacred ground.” Swedenborg thinks this encounter in the desert should, naturally enough, not be understood literally.

I call it natural religionbecause it doesn’t rely on supernatural miracles. Its creed is a belief in aprosperous development of the innate possibilities of each person. It is with Jesus as with Abraham. In Swedenborg, the story of Jesus reads like this: God descends into the womb of Mary and is born ahuman being. God naturally chooses the human form, which is hisown. Like the lives of other people, Jesus’ human existence is a lifelongeffort to uncover his divine derivation. Jesus conquers all worldly trials,the last and the hardest being the crucifixion, after which he becomesentirely divine. When we look at the man called Jesus, we see God.Jesus isGod. According to Swedenborg, the Gospels make it clear that Jesus and God are one. When Jesus refers to the Father, he refers to himself or tohis inner divinity. Father and Son are like body and soul, which cannotbe separated. In Christendom, Swedenborg observes, Jesus is called the son of Mary, and that appellation has given rise to serious delusions, particu-larly in Catholicism where Mary is extolled as queen of heaven.

In his epic saga, Swedenborg meets with Mary in heaven, who is annoyed at the proclivity to call Jesus her son. She regards herselfas a mere station on the way of God. Anyone can empathize with Swedenborg’s Christ. Jesus realizes the divine program of becoming an angel through his own efforts. Sweden-borg disregards miracles, faith-healing, raising the dead back to life, andsuch inexplicable phenomena. The cross symbolizes the internal strug-gle of Jesus; Swedenborg divests the mystery of the cross. The vicarioussacrifice of Christ, venerated by Christianity, is heretical to him. Thesaying “Jesus died for you” has been a solace to many but a deterrent toothers. Each and everyone must pay for his or her deliverance and, likeJesus, let the divine internal emerge victorious. Thus, the idea that Jesusbought us freedom with his blood seems absurd to Swedenborg. Themistake of Christian churches is to regard the suffering on the cross asthe redemption proper. Or to put is another way, Swedenborg brings Jesus down to raise him up. The miracle worker in Jerusalem disappears. Jesus did not die forour sins but, triumphantly, for his own, thus purifying and glorifyinghis human form.

Whether he transcribed God’s dictation or conceived it all on his ownmakes no difference. It is, and it is there to the great delight of anyonewho becomes acquainted with it. Should we call Swedenborg a Christian? Certainly, he is a professed Christian, and the Bible is the basis of his life.

Finally, God makes humankind to have dominion over the fish of thesea, the fowl of the heavens, and the beasts of the earth, to be ruler of all.When six days have passed, it is time for God to rest and regard hiswork. Swedenborg throws new light on this mystical course of events. Some psychologists maintain that we are magically connected with our beget-ting, the moment when our life is sparked in the intercourse of our par-ents. The biblical story of creation has a similar power of attraction andwas for centuries the most popular literary theme. In seventeenth-cen-tury Sweden, Haquin Spegel, Jesper Swedberg’s colleague and antago-nist, recapitulated the wonders of the world’s inaugural week in hismonumental work Guds Werk och Hvila (God’s Work and Rest). Spegel enthusiastically describes how things, animals, and human beingssprang forth and were arranged in an ingenious pattern. He regards theworld as created for the benefit of humanity and looks upon God as agood-hearted magician. Spegel’s book appeared in a new edition theyear of Swedenborg’s divine call, 1745. Swedenborg, however, rejects all this as mere childishness. While the story of creation may have a historical reference, the six days representstages of spiritual evolution. It is not the world that is empty; we are.The darkness over the deep refers to the inner life of the human race.We are spiritually devastated. This word, vastatio, so often used by Swedenborg, indicates the onset of a painful purging of evil and false-ness in the human soul. This particular state of mind heralds the newbirth. The regeneration that follows is the meaning of life. The six days of creation symbolically illustrate gradual spiritual growth. God makes herb-yielding seed and tree-bearing fruit, symboliz-ing inner growth. The life born in the waters and in the sky typifies thespiritual course.

To him, time does not exist; but to make us understand,the Author uses a chronology. The reader, for whom this is all written,is not yet mature enough to understand the purpose of life. For this rea-son, God makes use of well-known metaphors—the sun, the moon,sprouting seed, flying birds. To see the story of creation as the days of spring after a long winter in the heart of the human being is to me a very beautiful thought. Flowersand birds, fish and wild animals are the images of a new hope. Nothingshinders the reader from returning, after having been initiated into thesecret language of God, to a profane reading of Scripture, to see it all asa happy saga. If, then, the regeneration of humanity is perceived behindthe creation of the earth, the joy is doubled.42 Olof Lagercrantz"

Swedenborg envisions Adam as being born from an egg hanging on the T ree of Life in the middle of paradise. The ovule has been fertilizedby the spirit of God. Any reader who wants to know the literary modelsand historical setting of that wonder will find a reliable guide in IngeJonsson’s dissertation on Swedenborg’s drama of creation. 1 431.

      "text": "The infant Adam grows up in the most beautiful natural surroundings and is watched over and cared for by affectionate spirits. Indeed, all par- ents should consider the child-rearing methods they use. The child’s atten-tion is directed to a low-hanging bunch of grapes. Eager to reach them, thechild learns how to stand erect and to lift himself from the ground. Soon Adam is a young man who feels the desires of youth. The theme of loving companionship, which Swedenborg never fails to ad-dress, is thus introduced. Adam loses his way one night; he sleeps undera wonderful tree, a replica of the tree of his birth. He dreams of a beau-tiful, seductive nymph. As he tries to embrace her, she flees, and his de-sire is redoubled by her resistance. As they grapple together in the grass,Adam twists his body so badly that he feels a rib break loose. At thatpoint, the beautiful woman yields, and they kiss passionately. He wakes up to find his arms empty, the lovely woman but a vision of his dreams. However, during the wrestling and kissing, he has, withoutbeing aware of it, touched an egg hanging in the tree and fertilized itwith a vital spirit. With erotic heat, Swedenborg thus depicts the orgasm,the little death, of which eighteenth-century poets sang in a thousanddifferent ways. This intercourse has given rise to a new life. Eve is con-ceived, and she grows in the bosom of nature. When she has become ayoung girl, in her first age of laughter and play, she comes one day to awoodland mere with crystal-clear water. She kneels down and sees “herown ivory-white neck, her breasts, arms, and hands.” Amazed, she dis-covers that her own astonishment is reflected in her face. The young girlis yet wholly ignorant of the art of dissembling, still in the state of inno-cence that, according to Swedenborg, is the most desirable of all. When Swedenborg describes this amorous rendezvous, he remains in the area where he is at home—in dreams. Sexual excitement intensifiedby female resistance is a theme elaborated on in Swedenborg’s Conjugial Love, where it recurs in numerous variations, providing us with a hint of his personal preference. I fear that many modern readers will findAdam’s wrestling and Eve’s wistful gazing a bit ridiculous. There is atinge of the boudoir to these accounts as if courtly life, so familiar toSwedenborg, had proved contagious.44 Olof Lagercrantz"

Behind Adam chasing the fleeing nymph is the god Apollo pursuing Daphne, who was saved by Zeus, transformingher into a laurel. Behind Swedenborg’s Eve, another Eve is visible as thesource, the heroine of Milton’s Paradise Lost, whose sisters will be re-flected in thousands of literary creations in the centuries to come. InSwedish literature, the most beautiful of them all is named Selma, inbishop Frans Michael Franzén’s poem The Visage of Man. 2 Swedenborg is a genius, and he expects from himself the new and the genuinely original. He knew that the narrative in De Cultu was deriva- tive; thus, he did not finish the book. In fact, he had already plannedanother and more independent variant of God’s creation drama, whichwe have already seen in the preceding chapter. , Swedenborg did not entirely abandon his ambitions to write literature,however. Up to his last book, he strewed his theological paths with fab-ulous flowers called memorabilia , memorable relations or things worth remembering. The genre that comes closest to these creative miniaturesis the short story, and their style is related to that of cautionary comedyand opera, two other popular genres that Swedenborg knew very well.The scene of these episodes is always laid in the spiritual world, yet it isimpossible for me to believe that they were written “in spirit,” becausethey are ingeniously styled and show the meticulous care of literary pro-ductions. Swedenborg was so proud of them that they reappear in workafter work. Swedenborg often adopts the persona of a flaneur in the spiritual world, a stroller who just by chance happens upon curious surroundings.“Once when I was wandering in a tranquil mood and with peace in myheart, I saw at a distance a grove. . . .” or “When I went home from aEpic of the Afterlife 45 2.

In one memorable relation [Apocalypse Revealed §463], Swedenborg arrives at a magnificent harbor with many ships, heavily laden withgoods. On deck, young boys and girls sit, handing out wares to allpassers-by. Is this Gothenburg, the point of departure and arrival ofmany of Swedenborg’s sea voyages, or is it a port in Holland or in Eng-land, the port of ships from all parts of the world? The children arewaiting for their “beautiful tortoises,” which shortly disembark, carry-ing their young on their backs. The little tortoises look around, seeingthe far-off islands, an archipelago. The old tortoises have two heads, onelarge and enveloped in the same shell as their bodies, emitting a reddishlight. The other head is small and hides inside the larger one. The boys and the girls give the animals, who have human faces, vari- ous sweets, and the creatures gratefully lick the children’s generoushands. Then a moral exposition follows. The hard exteriors typify ossi-fied priests, and the dual heads delineate their duplicity. Swedenborgdelivers a powerful speech, and the whole spectacle is dissolved. Thereader, however, principally remembers the lively scenery with theyoungsters on deck and dispenses with the moral sense. , In one of the best of the memorabilia (True Christian Religion §80), an overbearing young man ascends from the underworld, having receivedspecial permission to enter the heavenly realm.

Religion is nothing but an enchantment of thecommon people, which encompasses their minds like an ether,in which notions of piety fly like butterflies in the air. . . .

Swedenborg does not drift into caricature, so I am inclined to thinkthat he himself may once have shared the demon’s views or at least hadbeen tempted by similar lines of thought. Voltaire’s contemporary satire Candide had triumphed throughout Europe for several years at the time Swedenborg recounted this memo- rable encounter, and its jesting and jeering tone may have been on hismind. Interestingly enough, Kant concluded his diatribe againstSwedenborg with a quotation from that very work. But more important, on the literary scene of the time there was an- other naysayer—the aforementioned Satan of John Milton, whose pow-erful rejection of divine power can properly be labeled horrifying.Furthermore, contemporary opinion placed Milton on a level with—ifnot above—Homer, Virgil, and Dante. Swedenborg never mentionsMilton in his writings—neither does he refer to Voltaire—but this is arevealing silence. Undoubtedly, Swedenborg was aware that the masterhand of Milton had moved behind his quill in De Cultu and that Par- adise Lost was invisibly present in his work. During the first thirty years of his life, Swedenborg lived under royal tyranny, that of Charles XII. The Swedish king managed to tear the country to pieces almost as successfully as Hitler destroyed Germany. Inthe spiritual world that Swedenborg constructs, there is no room for adark instigator of rebellion, just as there was no room for such a revolu-tionary in the dominion of Charles. The heavenly king retains totalitar-ian control; in his world, no other way and no other sway may exist.And so, to put the rebel in proper perspective, Swedenborg makes hisgodless blasphemer a harmless youngster. This depiction epitomizeswhat I regard as a fundamental foible in the author’s character: his lackof insight into the complexity of the soul. Evil becomes dangerous onlyinsofar as it is combined with good impulses. Milton’s Satan becomesfurious when he realizes that Eve is innocent, a trait that touches anerve within himself. In Swedenborg, the evil oozes like a poison intothe souls of mortals and spirits. Even though the destruction of the soul48 Olof Lagercrantz"

When confronted with the impious young spirit, Swedenborg resorts to a trick question, one that he repeatedly delights in using. He asks the imp about life after death, to which the latter replies that it is certainlya thing of the imagination. Perhaps some effluvium might rise from aburied corpse in the shape of a man, the evil spirit says, which wouldaccount for the belief, which so terrorizes foolish people. As with his spiritual encounter with Polhem, Swedenborg finds that he who laughs last laughs best: now the time has come for Swedenborgto set things right. “You are raving mad,” the author laughs. “You arenow living after death!” At this point, the evil spirit at last recalls wherehe is—and where he has been and what he has seen—and regretfullycries out, “I am mad!” Ashamed, he now remembers that he once sawthe heavens above and heard angels “utter things ineffable.” He prom-ises to tell everyone about this when he returns to hell and assuresSwedenborg that his hellish cronies will be abashed too. But, accordingto the psychological laws of the other life, on his return to hell, thedemon forgets everything he has learned and tells his friends that allthat he heard from Swedenborg was sheer madness. The man of learning and free inquiry, with his academic cap on his head, is one among many of the same profession that Swedenborgscourges. Philosophers invent beautiful terms only to disguise theiremptiness. They are like seekers lost in a vast forest who cannot see thesky for the dense ceiling of branches and foliage above their heads; thus,they rove about in the dark forever. But despite his taunts, Swedenborgcannot conceal that he is himself a philosopher and that his view of theworld and his outlook on humankind have been carefully considered.Epic of the Afterlife 49"

These worlds reflecteach other in point-counterpoint; the signatures are inverted. Imagine aman standing on a mirror: an exact copy of himself is found below his feet, turned upside down.

Left alone in their dark world,sinister spirits think they are blameless; but let the smallest beam ofheavenly light slip through and penetrate their atmosphere and they ap-prehend their wickedness. Then the appallingly distorted features oftheir faces come into view. This dualism permits Swedenborg to dramatize with abandon. The two societies, the positive and the negative, are a form of checks andbalances, creating equilibrium, both being equally strong. The result isstasis. This spiritual balance is also reflected within each human being.Throughout our earthly life, we are accompanied by two angels, one forthe will and the other for the understanding; but we also have two dae-monic spirits.

With this concept, Swedenborg displays an amazing proficiency in depicting the conditions of spiritual freedom. “What could stop theOmnipotent,” he once asks, “if he really wanted to compel us? Hecould force us to the altars with lightning-bolts and thunder, to bendour knees so we genuflect in worship. . . . With one word he couldcrush our wills with perpetual miracles. What would be genuine,then, if we were thus forced to comply? Would not our hearts burnwith corruption!” 1 Swedenborg’s own works may well be seen from a similar point of view. What could have stopped him from proving the existence of theworld of the dead, where he went every day, if he had really wanted toconvince us? Such a miracle would have forced our knees to bend inprayer. Swedenborg’s model, however, is God himself. The author’s taskis to show us a way of life that we can find reasonable and right. Mira-cles would humiliate and confuse us, would constrain our ability tochoose rationally. That Swedenborg does not offer such proofs—appar-ently never even considers their necessity—demonstrates that his spiri-tual world is a realistic construction. The mystery of life is concealed in the fact that we may freely choose good but, in the moment of decision, can also realize that God is lead-ing us. How is this possible? This means that we attribute everything toGod at the same time that we acknowledge acting from free will. Whenour choice favors goodness and truth, we become aware of God’s pres-ence and support and in this way realize that he has influenced our de-cision. If, on the other hand, we think that we do everything byourselves, that we execute merely our own will, then we are deceived,and our evil spirits have gained the day. God knows everything.

For this reason, God inhis benevolence does not openly direct us but does so furtively and im-perceptibly, as an invisible stream or a rising tide slowly carries a shipforward. Swedenborg says that humanity sees providence from hindsight, never from viewing the future. In other words, we do not understandour fate until we look back on our lives, until we retrospectively con-sider how it all came about. This teaching speaks directly to me andconfirms my own experience. This is another way of acknowledgingthat the Divine is present within all of us, but I am free to affirm ordeny this. To the beautiful image of the invisible current that makes the ship move while the crew notices nothing, Swedenborg adds an examplefrom his beloved garden. A man picks a fruit from a tree and gives it toa friend. In lifting his hand and taking the fruit, the man’s free will isengaged. The fruit, however, is created by God and has come to deli-cious ripeness thanks to the light and warmth of the sun, by means ofwhich God makes everything on earth grow and ripen. The man, see-ing the fruit on the branch and wanting to give it to someone, there-after consistently acts in a manner that emulates God.

In the comprehensive English concordance by John Faulkner Potts, comprising six thousand pages, the English words belief and faith take up about fifty full pages. Swedenborg takes great pains to combat false doctrines, but two of them, in particular, aroused his wrath. The first of these heresies was the notion of the split personalities of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, having the effect of being threedifferent persons. The consequence of this conception of the T rinity ispolytheism, an unpardonable sin. One day on a heavenly stroll, Swedenborg meets with some exalted clergymen, one of them a bishop who superciliously expounds his ideaof God.

Swedenborg listens attentively. When the clergyman finally becomes silent, our guide speaks up. If our imagination of God is built up bysensuous imagery—like the throne, the scepter, the crown, the dove—we inevitably end up with the fallacy of three gods. That we confess be-lief in one God makes no difference. As far as he is concerned,Swedenborg goes on, he has never, not even in childhood, connectedGod with anything sensory or material. God is one and indivisible—there is no other reasonable conception of the Divine. When Jesusspeaks about the Father, he refers to the Divine within himself. The second heretical delusion is related to the first. Faith without good deeds has no value at all. Consequently, the Holy Spirit cannot besent out to deliver any gifts of grace. As a matter of fact, “faith alone” isa main entry in the English concordance to Swedenborg’s works, a con-cept he waves unceasingly as a red flag. It may seem that, among matters of faith, Swedenborg pays too much attention to the T rinity. But to understand the explosiveness ofthis topic, we must examine the contemporary religious debate. Whenwe read about a war raging in Swift’s Lilliput between those who eateggs from the round end and those who prefer the more pointed one,we need to be informed that the point at issue is the Holy Supper. Swiftemploys the egg for our amusement, and Swedenborg too wants us tolaugh at the absurdity of the heretical premises. In his polemics, he mo-bilizes every conceivable literary weapon: subtle irony, coarse insults,sharp satire. He often repeats his ruse.

We harbor God within ourselves. To Swedenborg, faith is nothing but anobservance of our internal divine nature. It is a form of love, not athought, not something to be confessed. Faith comes with compassionas summer follows spring. Angels don’t use the word faith; they don’teven know its meaning. But if they hear the word spoken, they sense itas love. Those who are not in the service of love are outside the range ofreligion. Faith and love are always simultaneous. Faith is not strengthened by miracles; indeed, they undermine it. Miracles are violent since they force us to believe what we do not graspintellectually. Celestial angels, superior in spiritual development toother beings, know neither love nor faith. Instead of love, they havelove of goodness, while instead of faith, they have love of truth. The only faith that can save is one that leads to a righteous life. Hence, the notion of justification by faith alone is a fallacy. ForSwedenborg, thoughts lack value until they are put into practice. Forthis reason, iniquitous thoughts do not necessarily lead to damnation. Thus, a creed without direction is like a bird lost in the air. To be- lieve in an invisible God is nothing more than blind faith. If we imag-ine that God is a spirit or a soul, we will look for him everywhere in theuniverse; by doing so, the cosmos or nature itself becomes God, and weend up in a cult of the material. No one can approach an understandingof God without realizing that God is divine and human. Once we un- derstand this essential point, God becomes the foundation of our soul and the goal of life. In the Gospels, Jesus causes Swedenborg some worry because of his sayings on faith. In Matthew 9: 22, Jesus says to the woman who has56 Olof Lagercrantz 1.

As for moving mountains, Swedenborg explains this in another way: Jesus expresses himself in correspondences. The mountain is a metaphorof conceit, weighing colossally on the heart, where the tiniest mote ofbelief in divine love is enough to kick the whole mount—sin—into thesea that is hell. In the same light, Jesus’ statements on answered prayerscan be explained if we consider that the petitioner can never ask foranything beyond the kingdom of God.

The Grand Man is a spiritual body, and all its parts correspond to limbs, organs, and tissues found in the perceptible world. The Grand Man consists of the heavenly kingdom, which is the realm of the heart,and the spiritual kingdom, which is the domain of the lung. In a won-derful way, the two kingdoms are joined to one another, like the heartand the lungs in the circular system of the human body. The embryo and the fetus in the womb wholly pertain to the king- dom of the heart, since, while in the amniotic fluid, the lungs have notyet begun to operate. When the baby is born, he or she becomes subjectto both kingdoms, with the lung being dominant. If the child grows upto lead an honorable life, in love and truthfulness, then it will be possi-ble after death to return to the heart’s kingdom. This means, figura-tively speaking, a return to the matrix and a new birth. Thereafter, theheart is the ruler. All human organs are found in the Grand Man, and each corresponds to identical parts of the human body, which, in turn, respond to theirspiritual counterparts. In fact, this unifying bond is the rationale of ourlives. Without this connection to the macrocosm, we would not exist. Once Swedenborg experienced this conjunction directly. He felt how his thoughts and his will were controlled and directed in his brain. Heobserved that his lungs expanded and contracted by themselves, inde-pendent of his own volition. His heartbeat synchronized with hisbreathing.

If Kant had gotten the opportunity to read the Spiritual Diary , which was first published in the 1800s, that would have borne out hisdiagnosis. Year after year, Swedenborg spurs the flight of these fancies, yet he also keeps them under control, so that they form a consistent and ra-tional whole. He leads a harmonious life during this entire time and ap-pears in perfect health. For his garden, he orders plants and flower seedsfrom Holland. He welcomes visitors—the journalist Carl ChristopherGjörwell, grandfather of C. J. L. Almqvist, interviews him—and he at-tends dinner parties. One would think he would appear irrational withall those spirits running riot in his body, but he remains the same asever. Smiling, each day he records his discoveries. A folly that is constant and that can be gauged, weighed, calculated, and described with exact precision, each detail of its method geared to agrand scheme, cannot be called crazy. Thus, the allegation of madness isnegated by Swedenborg’s own essential method. All those spirits toilingwithin Swedenborg’s body are connected with the Grand Man. Our en-tire life and all that we experience in the natural world constitute a the-ater where scenes from the spiritual world are staged, all in the figure ofthe Grand Man. In the late-nineteenth century, when Darwin’s theory of evolution was first introduced, Strindberg thought he felt within himself themovements of fish and other creatures from prehistoric ages beforehomo sapiens first appeared on earth. Swedenborg, convinced that the Grand Man exists, weaves a net and joins himself to it. Thus, he has animmediate connection with the entire universe. Swedenborg repeatedly attests that he is fully awake, all his senses being aware and alert, when he visits spiritual beings. But so what?Strindberg concludes his novel Inferno by declaring that he actually lived through all the events in the book, and he invites anyone whodoubts the authenticity of his tale to read his diary for verification. Butthis was a lie, which today can be refuted by anyone who wants to in-quire into the matter by reading Strindberg’s now-published journals.62 Olof Lagercrantz"

Dante too writes in the first person, and he descends into the kingdom of death and reports on his wanderings. Acontemporary anecdote tells us of an Italian woman who thoughtDante’s dark complexion was caused by the burning flames of hell. , In 1744, when he was fifty-six years old, Swedenborg was permitted toresign from his post as assessor of the Royal College of Mines. He alsotook leave of science. From the study of nature and human anatomy, heprogressed to the matters of the soul. To reveal the hidden meaning ofHoly Writ became his most important task. Nevertheless, the scientificknowledge he had gained was not lost; it weathered this determinedtransformation and manifested itself in his new field of studies. Sweden-borg draws on his scientific lore, finding a new expression for it in hisgrand, didactic poem. He leaps from the body to the soul but keeps thesame system.. In Sweden, many learned authors have written about Swedenborg’s research and his contribution to science, Inge Jonsson foremost amongthem. Swedenborg’s scientific output is not as comprehensive as his re-ligious production, but it is still immense. In 1734, his Opera Philo- sophica et Mineralia was published, comprising three volumes, a remarkable tome on iron and iron works being one of the books. Thefirst volume of the trilogy, entitled Principia rerum naturalium , is an ap- proach to natural philosophy, where a cosmogony strictly based on thelaws of mechanics is outlined. In his next monumental work, on the dy-namics of the soul’s domain, Oeconomia regni animalis , nature is de- scribed as an organic system, the development of which is bestunderstood by analogy to the human body. Finally, in Regnum animale,1744–1745, he penetrates the labyrinths of the human body in searchof channels to the soul. The formation of the Grand Man provides himwith an opportunity to apply his theoretical erudition in full measure,and he quickly seizes it. Epic of the Afterlife 63"

Swedenborg built the Grand Man on his studies in natural science, andhis reputation was to rival that of Linnaeus. 4 Strindberg, the disciple of Swedenborg, created a Grand Woman of his own. After a long period of scientific studies, he wrote a poem calledHolländaren (The Dutchman), consisting of three songs. In the second song, a woman is described as representing a cosmic system in minia-ture, being a semblance of the universe. In the curve of her hip, thewriter sees the comet’s course; and in the hemispheres of the buttocks,he beholds the earth’s orbit around the sun. Her intimate parts are pic-tured in the brilliant constellation of Orion, and her knee is a nebula inthe Milky Way. All the universe, from the biggest to the smallest thing,is made to serve the daughter of heaven. The tendrils of a vine are visi-ble in her nostrils. Her eye is like a brown agate resting on a bed ofwhite-blue like a dove’s egg. This, one of the greatest and most magnif-icent poems in Swedish literature, is a continuation of Swedenborg’s po-etic creation. But there is a difference: while Strindberg aims for beauty, Sweden- borg seeks wisdom. Strindberg depicts a beloved woman, and he writesin sensual intoxication. Swedenborg writes of a being that is both manand woman, but he too is in love. God himself is the object of his love,and to be human is a distinguishing quality of God, who is also a unityof love and wisdom. The purpose of studying the Grand Man is to learnmore about life and the laws that regulate it. In the ordinary course ofevents, with the help of various things, lines, smells, visions, andsounds, Swedenborg draws his conclusions and relates them in the sys-tematic form of the Arcana. Occasionally—and the reader notes this with some concern— Swedenborg forgets his task and turns into a professor of anatomy 64 Olof Lagercrantz 4. Swedenborg and Linnaeus probably encountered each other at the Academy of Sciences and also at weddings and funerals since they were related by marriage, but neither mentionsthe other in his published works or personal writings.

Because the soul is present throughout thehuman body, the human spirit has human form. The world we see is a spectacle, the shadow play of the spiritual world.

For example, the kidneys scruti-nize the blood for contamination, and together with the ureter and thebladder drive impurities from the body. In these organs within theGrand Man reside judges whose tasks once were to search the secretthoughts of criminals and cleanse society of delinquency (Arcana Coeles-tia §§5283–5284). Their example is the righteous God of Psalms 7:9, who “tests the hearts and minds.” It’s hard for me to accept this account of a heavenly judge in all seri- ousness. I see it more as a flash of wit. I find it rather stimulating to bepresented with multiple body functions and organs as pieces of a puzzle. The tongue serves a double purpose since it receives food and forms speech. In the Homo maximus , it is the home of those who love the word of God and hunger for wisdom. Spiritual nourishment is knowl-edge, and taste corresponds to comprehension. With such fare, angelsand spirits thrive, and—wonderful to say—children in heaven grow toadulthood. The stomach digests the food, sorting out what is useful for the cir- culation of the blood, but at the same time the stomach is affected byfear and anxiety. The future is the source of our unrest. When we getthe better of our fear, the belly becomes appeased. In the abdomen,there are spirits who take pains to fill us with compunction, even whenthere is no reason at all for uneasiness. That’s why our stomachs are sosensitive. When we speak, our soul is speaking, but it is also hearing, although we are not aware of any of this. We listen, and we think that we hearwith our ears, but the soul is the true auditory organ. The tone of ourspeech, which is dictated by the soul, is more important than what wesay. For spirits, to hear is to obey, as the original meaning of obey is “to hear.” There are many kinds of listening, each corresponding in thespiritual world to a specific part of the ear: eardrum, malleus, stirrupbone, incus, the cylinders, the cochlea. The spirits of the ear are obedi-ent, but those connected with the external ear often do not understandwhat they hear.66 Olof Lagercrantz"

The answer is that in the spiritual world there are many channels of communication. In the first era of the human race, our species made use of a type of internal breathing that did not reflect in any way on our outer form.Speech was not yet articulated. People communicated silently by meansof the breath and subtle shifts in their lips and eyes. Swedenborg in-forms us that he learned to breathe in this special way when he was justa child, only to find out later in life that this particular mode of respira-tion is used in conversation with angels. When language was in its infancy, every word corresponded to a spir- itual idea. Through the words in the Bible, Swedenborg can approachGod. Biblical language is holy. In fact, this applies to some extent to alltongues. The conjunction between word and spirit exists in all language 68"

Swedenborg addresses the spirits in different languages. Often he uses his native tongue; a remarkable feature of the spiritual world is thatspirits immediately understand the language of a newcomer and beginto speak his language too. For a traveler from the far north whose nativetongue is usually not understood, this is a dream come true. Spirits arecapable of moving into any person they encounter, acquiring the mem-ories and diction of their host, which makes them believe that they re-ally are the individual they are inhabiting. At night in his bed,Swedenborg is frequently visited by spirits who believe they are Sweden-borg, assuming his wishes and phobias. Since the spiritual world is divided into kingdoms and societies, an- gels and spirits are distributed on different spiritual levels. The celestialangels, who live in the innermost heaven, are people of superior spiri-tual dignity. They never use words because they consider words grossand imprecise. They cannot even pronounce a word of any human lan-guage. Nor can they understand the fundamentalist’s meaning of theScriptures because, to them, the letter is dead. However, the twofoldmeaning of the Word exists for them. They cannot talk to human be-ings without angels of a lesser order acting as intermediaries. All living in heaven finally end up using a common vernacular, a uni- versal tongue. They are not taught this idiom, nor do they learn it.Rather, they are blessed with it. , More than anything else, language fertilizes Swedenborg’s fantasy. Inthis respect, he is like other great authors. Words constitute the mediumhe uses, and, as Inge Jonsson has pointed out, Swedenborg was ac-quainted with the philosophies of language of his time as well as thoseof bygone eras.

To them, figures do not represent countable units of time and dis- tance and the like—because there are no such things in heaven—butnumbers represent concepts and ideas. When he was “in the spirit,”Swedenborg once saw a long series of digits; he suddenly realized thatsome angels were communicating in an ancient, extinct language ofnumbers. On another occasion, he saw a heavenly writ constitutedsolely in numerals. Consider the poverty of our language. There is for the most part one word for “grief,” though there are thousands of related forms of pain.Or think of the concept “green,” the many tints and hues of which lan-guage, being such a limited instrument, is insufficient to express. I re-member Harry Martinson mentioning forty shades of green, for whichhe complained he did not have words. 1A numeral language, on the other hand, would manage an infinite exuberance of tints. In the past, Swedenborg tells us, every number had a profound and specific meaning, which is now forgotten, lost to us. Just a few of thesesignifications remain. The number two, for example, signifies the dualnature of God. The stone tablets of the Law, given to Moses, are two.The first of these concerns the love of God, while the second, the loveof one’s neighbor. The number three is holy since God is trine, made upof Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; but as we have seen previously, it is agrave sin to have the T rinity disintegrate in three different parts. The number seven represents the peace of the seventh day of cre- ation. Whenever the angels of heaven use it, they recall its origin. Andthe number ten is a representation of God, which is seen by the Deca-logue, the Ten Commandments. The number twelve signifies faith—think of the Apostles.

Actors, who know the possibilities of modulation, would profit from studying Swedenborg.

In his book Beröringens ABC (A Primer Of Touch), Horace Engdahl writes that we apprehend the language and the text of a book’s page assomething spatial and firm. 3The reader’s primary task is to vitalize the original thought once it has been solidified in the written word. Eng-dahl quotes a passage in Goethe: “When Shakespeare wrote his plays,he could hardly imagine that his works would live word for word inprint and thus be criticized, compared to other works, and studied.Rather, he had the stage before his eyes when he wrote, looking uponhis plays as mobile and animated, swiftly passing hearing and sight asthey flew out from the stage into the audience, impossible to hold andto scrutinize. For him, the immediate moment and the meaninggrasped in that fleeting second was all.” I assume that, from his intensive study of Swedenborg’s works, Goethe inferred that the Bard’s words are preceded by wordless imagesand events. This is a delightful idea, but I find it hard to be convincedthat the words really don’t come first. With true artistry, the angels enact their meaning. Knowledge is si- multaneously received by the eye and the ear. To do this, angels andspirits emit wonderful alternations of light and shade to make them-selves clear. In the innermost heaven, everything is expressed by the in-terplay of celestial light effects. In one episode, spirits communicate with Swedenborg using flames of various colors.

Their songs manifest joy, and they resemble earthly singing. Song links the present life and life here- after. Swedenborg has heard the angels sing, and he noticed how thespirits were entranced by the sound.

However, he does pay assiduous attention to thefive senses. Of course, he had done this already in his earlier works onanatomy. During his theosophical period, this interest blazes up againwith redoubled intensity because the eye, ear, nose, and skin offer idealopportunities to illustrate the doctrine of correspondences. So, the sen-suous world enters through a back door, as it were, and infuses enchant-ing life into his work. Each part of the indefinitely complex organism that constitutes the human body has, according to Swedenborg, a spiritual counterpart, and 761. Georg Stiernhielm (1598–1672), a relative of Swedenborg, is often called the father of Swedish poetry. Like Swedenborg, he was a scientist, philosopher, and government official;he also wrote epic poetry and laudatory verse. Poet and composer Carl Michael Bellman(1740–1795) was the most famous troubadour in Swedenborg’s Stockholm."

      "text": "this also applies to the senses. Behind the physical eye, there is another eye determining sight, while inside the ear, a spiritual ear allows ourhearing. Our soul determines our perception. Of course, we are all more or less aware that our senses are geared to impulses from within, as our vision complies with the mind’s eye. Pas-sion and imagination determine experience. Look at the person youlove. Your visual organs don’t paint the features you adore; your innereye does. By always keeping this idea at the center of his vision,Swedenborg makes it easier for each of us to understand ourselves. When the body dies, the inner sensory organs take charge. Once we feel at home in the spiritual world, perception becomes clearer thanever because on earth the external senses obscured everything, as if allwere covered with a veil. In a touching way, Strindberg also used thisidea in his drama Ett Drömspel (A Dream Play). The daughter, who be- longs to a higher, purer world, bewails her earthly dwelling-place, cut tothe quick by “feeling my vision weakened by an eye, my hearing less-ened by an ear, my bright lofty thoughts cooped up in labyrinths oflard.” She longs to return from whence she came, where the senses arenot enslaved and imprisoned. Swedenborg brings her thither, repatriat-ing this daughter of heaven. The eye is the finest part of the countenance, on intimate terms with the understanding. Through the eye, light streams into each person.When we say that one’s eye has been opened, that one has gained in-sight, we harken back to a relic of primordial language, where every-thing relating to the senses had spiritual significance. A certain flame oflife and quivers of light in the eye guide us. Everything has a doublesense, but we are not aware of this in our mortal life. The eye has the power to change the world. In the spiritual world, Swedenborg sees foxes, eagles, sheep, and bucks; but when they comenearer, they transform into humans. The animals were images createdby the internal sight. The great French artist Grandville, who brilliantlydepicted people as beasts, would feel at home here. 2Epic of the Afterlife 77 2. Jean-Ignace-Isidore Gérard (1803–1847), who used the pseudonym Grandville, was a cari- caturist who achieved fame with satirical lithographs, often depicting public figures as animals."

Music is sweeter and more meaningful in the spiritual world thanon earth, and the angels singing in choirs experience the highest bliss ofharmony, a feeling made even greater by the curious fact that each angelthinks he or she is the conductor. Smells too have corresponding functions. This is perhaps the most surprising aspect of Swedenborg’s doctrine of the senses. Swedenborgremained a child at heart even at an advanced age, and he was alwaysfond of children. Several people who knew him testified to this. As weknow, children are more sensitive to smells than are adults. The olfac-tory sense is regulated by the oldest part of the brain and is thought tobe the most primitive sense. Scents thus have the remarkable power ofcalling up buried memories, a faculty unparalleled in the sensory sys-tem. Swedenborg calls our attention to this fact. Individuals, Swedenborg remarks, have a distinctive perfume, pecu- liar to their character. This is not clearly perceived before we enter thespiritual world, where it becomes obvious. On earth, these odors aresensed by dogs and a select few. Some people today believe that com-puterized “sensemographs” of the future will be able to detect those se-cret scents, which will replace personal codes and social-securitynumbers. If such a machine should ever be constructed, it should benamed after Swedenborg. The nose is in the service of goodness since life-giving air streams into it. The nostrils, constituting a holy twosome, can tell the goodfrom the bad. The wind in God’s nostrils signifies heaven. We must remember that deodorants were not known in Sweden- borg’s time. Smells were more apparent than nowadays, and there wasnothing special about an offensive stench. Domestic animals were al-ways close at hand, and cows and horses left their marks on home life.Sweat bathed each moment, and remarkably enough it continues to befelt in the spiritual world. Swedenborg’s London stank, and alleys inparticular were infernally offensive, as William Blake was to describe so78 Olof Lagercrantz"

In this respect, we can consider our time poor and Swedenborg’s rich. He lived in a wealth of odors. And he evokes this when he sets a thou-sand sweet smells free in heaven, replenishing them with a symbolicessence. In the natural world, animals recognize each other by their smells, Swedenborg observes. In the afterlife, we will congregate in a similarway and seek a community with our own smell. Swedenborg makes up whole registers of odors that can be used as maps for tours of the spiritual world. We can smell what kinds of peo-ple are living in a particular spiritual area. He assures us that spirits havethe keenest scent and that their sharp sense of smell helps to orientthem. For example, if we smell burnt bread, we are approaching eloquent speakers who fill themselves on empty rhetoric. If there is a nasty smellof excrement, then voluptuaries are nearby. Spiteful and vindictive spir-its reek of corpses. Once a few of these were granted leave from hell togive Swedenborg the opportunity of examining them. The nauseatingstench made him vomit. Those who persecute the innocent smell likehovels infested by vermin. The greedy smell of rats or have a puff of“the fumes of scalded swine in a slaughtering-trough.” However, when we approach loving and tender spirits, we recognize the fragrances of the earth in spring or perhaps the scent of newly bakedbread. If a vapor of wine is detected, a flatterer may be lurking in thevicinity. However, if the spirit’s intention is good and his dispositioncharitable, flattery is excusable. A happy marriage is revealed by thesmell of cinnamon. In the spiritual world, Swedenborg somewhat resembles his contem- porary Linnaeus in that he notes remarkable things without always forc-ing them into a moral scheme. But then the artist within him prevails;and thanks to his poetic nature, the smells come alive. They are stillfresh, redolent, and pungent, as if they had been just picked or pre-served through the centuries. Erik Axel Karlfeldt, our foremost lyricistEpic of the Afterlife 79"

Among the benches and the tubs of hot water, female bath attendants are dimly seenthrough the steam. Kitchen smells blend with those of medicinal oint-ments and concoctions. If a spirit has a good heart, he or she inhales this wealth of sweet smells with the greatest delight but is repelled by anything that smellsnasty. It is just the other way round with the evil spirits, who perceivethe sweet scents as acrid and horrid and delight in the foul-smelling.This substantiates spiritual law, according to which everyone gets onwell in an environment that fits his or her nature. The tongue plays a twofold and wonderful role. Among the sensory organs, it alone is visible. A tongue can be stuck out or withdrawn mys-teriously into the body. Swedenborg says that the tongue guards the en-trance of both the lungs and the stomach, because of its double service.It is both the organ of taste and an organ of speech and thus unifiesheaven and earth. In the spiritual world, it refuses anything evil, butsome tongues, looking like small flames, have been seen descending tothe underworld. When we arrive in the spiritual world, the tongue can distinguish be- tween truth and lie. The proud polyglot who had not used his knowl-edge of earthly languages to seek after truth suddenly does notunderstand a single word.

When he ventures into alien societies in theuniverse, Swedenborg gets into trouble as he did in London in hisyouth, when he illegally disembarked a ship sailing under a cholera flagand risked capital punishment. His fantasy always bubbles with activity, but perhaps never so much as in his encounters with people from other planets.

In 1755, the earth-quake in Lisbon takes place, shaking all of Europe as well and prompt-ing the two greatest satirical novels of the era, Voltaire’s Candide and Samuel Johnson’s Rasselas. These three works question our civilization and culture. Swedenborg does not mention any of these writers byname, but they seem to me to be present in the background. Swedenborg is not the first space traveler. In antiquity, Lucian visited strange planets, and such excursions have been taken by writers andthinkers of all times, but Swedenborg’s flights sparkle with dazzlingoriginality. Swedenborg often appears to live in his fantastic creation. One day in October in 1748, he records in his diary that, whenever he thinks of hisgarden, of the gardener who cares for it, of financial affairs, of the re-ception of his work and how it would perhaps be misunderstood, or ofpurchases close at hand, he loses his ability to concentrate and becomes82 Olof Lagercrantz 1.

He recommendsthat individuals be prohibited from distilling alcoholic beverages intheir homes, assigning exclusive rights for the production of liquor tothe state. But his days and his nights are mostly devoted to dreams andto his mighty exegesis, and current history rarely obtrudes. The earth-quake in Lisbon leaves no trace. Such silence on current events can be explained in many ways. Swedenborg’s spiritual world is a product of his time, and he shares thelong-cherished dream of a just and equal society, as fostered among theflower of intellectuals, a dream that soon would materialize in theAmerican war for independence and the French Revolution. Sweden-borg’s universe is part of a large utopia, to which Plato, Thomas More,and Jonathan Swift had earlier contributed. It was followed by thinkerslike Karl Marx and Edward Bellamy, until the time came for GeorgeOrwell, Aldous Huxley, and later writers to portray the future as a helland to depict the failure of a world plan. In a tragicomic turn, Johan Henric Kellgren, Sweden’s most cele- brated representative of the Age of Reason, associated Swedenborg withall sorts of tricksters, mesmerists, and alchemists who appealed to su-perstition. 2There were many of that sort at that time, but Swedenborg repeatedly took exception to them.

How-ever, what Swedenborg has written on these matters—and Kellgren herephrases his words with a turn of the infamous obloquy so popular in ac-ademic circles—“rather bears witness to what he has learnt than to thelucidity of reasoning.” Nevertheless, it is “the mystical works, whichcover a whole wall” that are the source of Kellgren’s rancor and madehim, unconscionably, “place Swedenborg on the list of nitwits.” As in Kant’s case, ignorance and superficiality revile. Kant was un- aware that Swedenborg was an ally. In his Spiritual Diary §5565, Swedenborg mentions the magazine The Spectator, which flourished in 1711 when Swedenborg was in London on his long educational jour-ney. Its liberal attitude was his own. Perhaps the mark of folly, withwhich Kant and Kellgren branded Swedenborg, may have had some for-tunate effects.

When they arein their beds, they never face the wall but always the room so as not toturn their backs on the Lord. When Swedenborg learns about this, herecalls that he usually sleeps with his face to the room. Now he under-stands why. The people of Jupiter don’t say much but think a lot. When they speak, no words are heard, only a soft buzz. They spend considerabletime dining, not because their cooking is that extravagant but to enter-tain guests and enjoy their company. They do not use chairs but sit onfig leaves on the floor. Their houses are built low and decked with whitish-blue bast fiber or bark.

Thus, the death penalty is the verdict. There are also Catholic dissidents on Jupiter. A few call themselves saints, urging their henchmen to address them as “Lord.” These mastersforbid their followers to pray to God directly, regarding themselves asdemigods or a kind of middlemen. As a sign of their loftiness, they weartowering top hats. Such undemocratic and elitist traits provoke Sweden-borg’s anger. During his spiritual crisis, on April 7, 1744—the day after Jesus had revealed himself in a dream—Swedenborg thought that perhaps hewould himself one day be looked upon as “a holy man.” Sometimes, hewrites, people are regarded as saints and become objects of devotion.Startled by this thought, Swedenborg makes up his mind to be wary ofsuch a dangerous conceit. Still, I think it’s worth noting that thisthought does occur to him, like a daydream of unprecedented honor.Given an assignment by God, from whom he has received the keys tounlock his Word, how could he avoid reflections of pride? After his death, Swedenborg’s adherents acclaimed him almost like a saint. His splendid sarcophagus is on display in Uppsala Cathedral. Thereverence paid to his texts by translators serves those who find it hard toread his Latin. The New Church translators spare no pains to preserveevery shade of meaning. In many ways, Swedenborg resembles the “holy” inhabitants of Jupiter. When people with such pretensions arrive in heaven, they areinitially idolized by their dependants, but soon enough they cut aridiculous figure and are ridiculed. On earth, Swedenborg often was theobject of such derision. The spirits of Jupiter relate that these legions ofpeople, among whom we recognize some popes and canonized divines,think they can chop wood in heaven to stay warm. Under the billets,there is a human form—which is actually their own reflection—andthey hack through themselves.

They closely ex-amine Swedenborg’s memory, leaving nothing to chance, imbibing allspiritual nourishment, turning up their noses at the rest. WhenSwedenborg wants to show them the splendor of meadows, gardens,forests, and glittering rivers, they hasten to fill the meadows with ser-pents and pollute the rivers. When he asks them why they are doingthis, they reply that they try to screen off external reality completely,making the inner life their pivot. As it turns out, however, they are not unwilling to listen to Sweden- borg and make exceptions to this puritanical attitude (see Arcana Coelestia §7071) For example, they watch the flight of birds with joy. Swedenborg finally manages to make them see a wonderful garden withChinese lanterns and lamps, without their changing it. Thus, the spiritsof Mercury were able to see tangible things, with the proviso that somespiritual meaning was implied. Once, when Swedenborg was writing at his desk, spirits from Mer- cury were present and criticized his style for not being spiritual enough,too blunt and gross. In his defense, Swedenborg pointed out that thepeople of Earth would otherwise not understand him because theythemselves are materialists. The spirits of Mercury scoffed at the Earthcreatures who would believe things written down on a piece of paper.They certainly were not of two minds about Rousseau’s questionwhether morality has been perverted by science and art. Spirits from Saturn are honest and humble and, therefore, appear small (Arcana Coelestia §8948). If someone tries to lure them away from God, they wish they were dead, and small knives immediately appear intheir hands. They’d rather stab themselves in the breast than live with-out faith.

Because of this remorse, they are forgiven and areelevated to heaven (Arcana Coelestia §7250–7251). Swedenborg, who had the opportunity to witness this act of redemption, says that thehappiness shining in the eyes of the saved moved him to tears. Outside our solar system, life is more like the Golden Age on Earth (Arcana Coelestia §10159 f.) Swedenborg shares Rousseau’s dream of a life of innocence in the bosom of Nature. He must at least have heardof Rousseau. Indeed, he somewhat resembles Rousseau in his plain andfrugal way of living.

There is a likeness between Swedenborg and the Swedish poet Artur Lundkvist because of central importance of dreams in their work and the imaginary creation of worlds. 5In Drakblod (Dragon Blood), pub- lished in 1936, Lundkvist writes: “We must invent symbols for our elu-sive dreams, of the yet uncertain and unattainable we imagine willmaterialize in a remote future, symbols that can shine in our dreams bynight and branch out into the thickets of our wishes.” Swedenborg pro-duces such symbols by means of distant planets. , In Swedenborg’s time, humankind had not yet gotten over the shock ofCopernicus. Until the sixteenth century, our little Earth was the centerof the universe, and the sun its vassal. At the midpoint of the world’s his-tory, Jerusalem was built, and there at Mount Calvary the cross waserected, from which issued the message that saved the world..

But the measure of Swedenborg’s mind is far greater than that of any of his contemporaries, and he does not accept such dethronement.While many eighteenth-century poets expounded on the theme “TheLittleness and Powerlessness of Man,” Swedenborg takes the oppositeline. Whereas he allows millions of celestial bodies to be inhabited bypeople who after death congregate in a collective haven, he transcendsCopernican order. The same God rules everywhere. All suns, stars,planets orbit in the organism of the Grand Man. What more couldunity-seeking humanity wish for! However, in this constellation, Jesus poses a problem since he cannot be known on any other planet. It would be absurd to state that Jesushad been crucified on each of the infinite number of rotating worlds. So, Jesus is not found on Mars nor anywhere else in the universe, ex- cept on Earth. Maybe Swedenborg felt this as a relief. It has sometimescrossed my mind that he created these inhabited expanses just to get ridof his own objections. The absence of Jesus is the invisible pattern ofthese planetary stories. The words of the Sermon on the Mount, “the Kingdom of God is within you,” are reflected everywhere in Swedenborg’s outlook on hu- mankind. Nonetheless, the idea that humanity has been let off scot freewith the blood of Christ repels him (see my chapter 4, “The Book ofGod”). Each individual must pay for him- or herself. This substantiallyadds to Swedenborg’s supplies of tolerance. In this way, he acknowl-edges the great liberation process of the Renaissance and the Age ofReason. He joins the struggle against religious tyranny. The afterlife isnot a gift reserved for Christians. All human beings are received inheaven and have the same chance to become an angel as any Christianhas, be they born in uncharted regions of the African continent or inanother solar system where the name of Jesus has never been heard.Jesus turns into a local god by the side of the Ruler of the universe.

Their reli-gious expression is often more pious and ardent than that of earthlycreeds. Some of Swedenborg’s extraterrestrial fancies may be reckonedas artistically extravagant. He did, after all, have an inclination forcurlicues. All in all, life and manners on other planets often seem to merecounted with the tacit purpose of demonstrating that Jesus is not in-dispensable for the work of redemption. Why, then, did God manifest himself as Jesus on our planet and not elsewhere? Swedenborg’s answer courts mockery, but at the same time itdemonstrates the boldness of his thoughts and the purity of his heart. On Earth, knowledge about God had withered away, and humanity was wandering in the darkness without a guiding light. However, God’slove and wisdom were extant in the Word. God saw to it that the abil-ity to read and write evolved on our planet. This knowledge was not re-quired in other worlds, where wisdom had survived (Arcana Coelestia§9350). Here on Earth, different nations actively exchanged ideas, shipscrossed oceans, and the Bible had a wide circulation. This terrestrialwanderlust was lacking on other worlds where people stayed in thesame place all their lives and were content with their little piece of theuniverse.

But among many of them, a lying tongue payslip service to sacred things, while the real object of their devotion is na-ture. There are zealous enthusiasts too. They winnow out faith and love,stuffing them in a knapsack on their backs, as it were. When theypreach, it is as if they have a ruminant stomach to vomit things apt tobe congested by the audience. Such regurgitation is still going on, andthe heartburn has not lost its acidity. Although Swedenborg has a solid knowledge of nature and its work- ings, the reader may not notice this because sensory impression imme-diately becomes spiritual and ethical substance. False people are likecheaters who deceitfully proffer pigeon eggs labeled as great horned owlova, Swedenborg observes. In other words, he knows that the eggs ofthe owl are as white as those of the dove. One morning in the spiritual world, Swedenborg met with some people whom he identified as Chinese since they manifested images of awoolly goat, a millet loaf, a spoon of ivory, and a city floating on glassywater, all of which means that their composure is built on a spirit ofcommunity. This is, after all, the time of the East India Company, andrelations with China are busy. Swedenborg says that those reluctant to accept his message resemble a lad playing blindman’s buff who thinks he can find his way with cov-ered eyes; a sailor sailing without a compass; a wanderer in the fog whothinks he has grabbed a bird but has snared a scorpion that gives him alethal sting; or seagulls and kites sinking their claws into a huge fishthat drags them down into the black depths.

In Swedenborg, I recognize this experience of in-tensified light, only his is stronger and more frequent. Light in heaven is spiritual, Swedenborg explains, and it is emitted from the Lord who is the sun of the spiritual world. Our sun is a sym-bol of that higher sun. This seems to be an excellent solution to mymystery. It is also, Swedenborg says, a key to Jesus’ words, “I am thelight of the world” (John 8:12). A human spirit is laid bare to the eyes of angels, who immediately perceive its inward dimensions. A spirit who is false fears the rays ofheaven. If a spirit is good, it looks beautiful, but an evil spirit is mon-strous to behold. In heaven, heat and love are one. Divine truth appears as light, and divine goodness as warmth. However, the two are combined into one,although some angels acquire one aspect more than the other. This combination of heat and light makes the earth bloom with life. In heaven, the same thing happens. It is named paradise for the unionof truth and goodness, which is seen in the marriage of light andwarmth in springtime on earth. With a strange trembling in his voice, Swedenborg says that trees, corn, grass, fruit—everything in our earthly environment—comes fromthe light and heat of the sun. Such is the vital force of sunshine. Howgreat, then, must be the generative power of divine light! That words and things are signs becomes evident to any reader of Swedenborg. In a passage in his great book on iron, published in1734—ten years before the dream crisis—Swedenborg describes thediscovery of a vein of pure silver in an iron mine in Nordmark in Värm-land, 1726. “That precious find,” he wrote, “lay in the iron as thoughin the bosom of its mother or nurse. The iron had long been pregnantwith this child, until, after the passage of much time, it brought forththis progeny. However, this beautiful and eagerly awaited child did notlive long before departing some months later, in its father’s care.” ThisEpic of the Afterlife 95"

Thenplease explore the nature of joy, and you will learn.” The angel then dis-appears, and the spirit goes on his quest. He asks everyone he meets onthe road, but the answers differ. “A joy is a joy,” somebody replies.” Joysare all the same. We know no difference between them.” “Joy is the smile of thought,” someone else responds. “When you are happy, your face is bright and exuberant. You are merry and satisfiedand move about with a light heart.” “Joy involves delicious food with good beverage, to be intoxicated by choice vintages, to prattle about various matters involving erotic play-fulness. These are still other assets in the realm of joy,” replies yet a thirdspirit. The curious spirit is left disappointed with these answers, which ap- pear to him boorish. Then the angel reappears and guides him to a hillwhere spirits preach that joy is a feeling stemming from active love. Joyis benevolence. All human beings live in their joy. The pleasure of theevil person is revenge and deceit. The good person delights in the gooddeeds of his or her kindness. Swedenborg produces a number of cautionary tales from paradise, which accentuate the childlike, Sunday-School aspect of his character. Those who hope for sensuous pleasures and grand banquets in para- dise are invited to feast in heaven with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob asdinner partners. They sit at long tables, and exquisite dishes and selectwines are served. They eagerly sink their teeth into the courses. It is din-ner and dancing, and during the subsequent performance, symphonicmusic is heard.

One day Swedenborg witnesses how recently arrived spirits find a home for themselves in an angelic community. Some of them look invain for suitable quarters. A specially trained watchman then is calledin, to gauge the inward light and heat of the homeless visitors. It turnsout that they are in the wrong place. Misconceptions on the nature of bliss arise from the difficulty of un- derstanding heaven as a summit of the human soul that has to be con-quered in every heart. If you want to go to heaven, you must bringheaven with you; you will not get more than you can carry. Heaven isnot a kingdom of happiness where God rules as king who distributesgifts of grace. God is not in heaven. God is the force behind everythingas the sun is the source of life. God is transcendent. God does not interfere. He could not even if he wished to, since he does not see the finite but only what comes from him. God can only livewith his own. God is simply the infinite and eternal within each of us. As we have seen in the earlier chapter “The Book of God,” hu- mankind is an image of God, but the Divine is hidden within us andinvisible to us. Although we no longer know what heavenly happinessis, the need for it remains with us. We long to return. That quest givesmeaning to our lives. Swedenborg’s heaven is a dream of the soul’sgrowth. Therefore, we cannot be lifted up to the angels by mercy. Were this possible, anyone could achieve heavenly bliss. Jesus was a bit rash whenhe promised the repentant thief hanging beside him on the cross, “Onthis day you will be with me in paradise.” Swedenborg avoids criticizingsuch an exalted authority, but he stresses that heaven is not a gift andthat not even God can present it to just anyone. We get our just deserts.Heaven is the triumph of the heart. It is impossible to reach heaven without preparation and a lengthly spiritual growth of the mind.

Such changes of heart are impossi-ble, Swedenborg declares, whereupon the apostle appears before him asa baby who can neither think nor talk but only wave its hands, a pictureof the helpless who believe they can be saved by a miracle ( Spiritual Diary §4322). Swedenborg stresses that the serenity of heavenly happiness is ineffa- ble. Only those who know the way can reach heaven. We learn theroute by reflecting on its noble travelers.

He felt compassion for all the wretched souls who are plaguedby worries. This was the hour of deliverance. This beatific state lastedabout sixty minutes. Perhaps the splendor of the day contributed to thissingular experience. It was spring and the migrating birds had recentlyarrived (Spiritual Diary §1908). During the fall of the same year, Swedenborg recounts in his diary the story of a man who was celebrated on earth and had acquired repu-tation as a wise and pious man.

The man infatuated with the glorious light had to learn that there is yetanother and much deeper blessedness. It is likely that this man is a secret self-portrait, and that the diary entry written in autumn reconsiders the tranquil poise of the experienceof spring. Isn’t this venerable individual Swedenborg himself? The lightof glory may imply self-indulgence. At heart, affection turned outwardis pivotal: the love of the neighbor. Here I personally come to think ofthe enjoyments of the arts, of music especially, with all its transports ofjoy that tempts us to escape from reality. Even in the diary entry of May, we find beautiful words on compas- sion, however, and that is the sense of belonging. Community is theessence of paradisiacal felicity. The sluggishness of newcomers is notonly an effect of the unfamiliar milieu, but also stems from the absenceof like-minded companions with whom they can exchange hearteningthoughts (Spiritual Diary §400). Swedenborg’s writings are manuals of living together. The exchange of views with kindred souls is Sweden-borg’s ideal, a dream that hardly ever came true in his own life. Hisworks are alive with personal need for contact. Some of the most per-sistent and lonely-hearted spirits among those trying to get in touchwith him are from his own sparsely populated and reticent homeland. Swedenborg was an eccentric and heretic who had to keep quiet and act in secrecy to avoid prosecution. All his works were published abroad,and in his lifetime he had few readers. In his heaven, seats of honor arereserved for those who fought for the freedom of speech and for the lib-erty of the press. In the London of the spiritual world, such importantpersons live in stately neighborhoods. According to Swedenborg, theEnglish in particular have an inward intellectual light and represent a su-perior Christianity. Although this cannot be seen in the present life, itbecomes obvious in the next. They have acquired this light through lib-erty of thought and other democratic rights and privileges. Accordingly, Swedenborg’s gigantic exegetical work, the Arcana Cœlestia, was published in London. What a stroke of bad luck that 102 Olof Lagercrantz"

In Christendom, holy men and women retreat to sacred seclusion, symbolic Swedes all of them. The devout hermit in the desert is a hal-lowed Christian figure. But to Swedenborg, that recluse is a disgrace tohumanity because he has forgotten that love of God presupposes love ofhis fellow man. In reality, his solitary contemplation is mere selfishness. For Swedenborg, all spiritual growth is based on encounters and dia- logue. Mystical union with God and religious ecstasy are alien to him.There is no worship without charity. This duality is the essence ofhuman nature. In Swedenborg’s visions, the saints are in trouble. Even the apostles are ungraciously dealt with. Thousands of angels are their spiritual superiors,Swedenborg reports [ Spiritual Diary §1330]. He also notes that the ar- rival of parsimonious individuals to a spiritual community makes life amisery. Generous care and sharing are the source of cosmic exultation. One stubborn apparition surprises Swedenborg by assuring him that living alone is a piece of cake. This lone wolf was granted complete iso-lation, just as he wished.

A number of spirit-angels form a candelabra of lights and floral arrange- ments and think they have made this themselves. Swedenborg then in-forms them that the Lord conducts their performance, and they realizethat the stranger is right. The same kind of heavenly phenomenon,where several spirits assemble to form sacred images, is found in Dante’sParadiso. In the higher heavens, angels have fulfilled all the potentials latent in humankind. Still, every angel knows that he or she is far from the god-head and that there is yet a long way to travel. They visualize divine de-light as a wonderful palace with a stairway of twelve steps. Nobody getsto even the first step without divine guidance. Although angelic bliss is a state of ardent attachment, it does not in- clude any specific understanding of how their satisfaction is broughtabout. They do not store in their memories what they learn about divine wisdom. Rather, they embody it and bring it to life. Angelic wisdom shows itself in a humble awareness of not being wise. They don’t consider themselves superior to anyone and assumethat every being they meet is their equal or better. For them, divine truth is self-evident. Doubt is impossible. To an angel, doubt would be like visiting a garden with a friend and thenquarrelling about the existence of the garden. Swedenborg is exceptionally intense and persuasive when he de- scribes the stages of angelic development. A sudden impression of innergrowth and an impulse to share with others are good signs. In hell,everything is reversed. In the infernal world, all want to keep things forthemselves and anxiously guard their possessions, and this greed is themajor source of pain. Angels refuse all tokens of gratitude, since they feel that their charita- ble actions are inspired from above.

It’sthe stuff dreams are made of. As soon as he falls asleep, he is transportedto a world of marvelous chimera. Hellish images dominate and form aninferno. This place is not as serious and embittered as in Dante, butmore vivid and agile. Swedenborg’s ingenious variety is unmatched inthe history of hell. Among artists, Hieronymus Bosch comes to mind. Inhis paintings, men are devoured and disgorged by prodigious whales. Ina swamp, people snap at each other’s shoulder. Voluptuous women claweach other to bits.

Just as he had done during his dream crisis, Swedenborg interprets his spiritual visions and dreams, but as soon as the moral is clear to him,he discards the stories since they are mere semblances and allegories ofthe more important meaning. Who is the progenitor of these throngs of wickedness and aberra- tions? From whose life experience do they stem? Perhaps this is all anexpression of the secret suffering of the human race, finding expressionthrough a spokesman. The world Swedenborg perceives contains the accumulated experi- ences of humankind.

Several spirits confess that retaliation is the ultimate delight.

The intrigued reader is happy to take part in this diverse gathering and doesn’t much care to be instructed by Swedenborg’s concluding al-legorical exposition. In Dante’s Inferno, the damned remain forever trapped in the same zone, which means that we, the readers of the poem, will always findthem where we expect them to be. Swedenborg’s fiends, however,change places and positions all the time. Together they constitute a fic-tional ballet where each demon and siren enact miscellaneous parts,swiftly shifting roles between them. No doubt Swedenborg found theseplays entertaining, though frightening too. We may regard them as akind of divertissement performed in his summerhouse in his garden atHornsgatan. T wo centuries later, on that site, the Mullvaden (mole) block at Sö- dermalm in Stockholm, Swedenborg’s former property, young protes-tors occupied buildings, reacting against the Swedish demolition frenzyof the 1970s. Their sit-in was protracted, the squatters enduring severehardships for a year. Finally, the police launched an armed assault, re-sulting in a war drama of songs and speeches against police batons,swords, and rearing horses. Swedenborg could have directed this fromhis heavenly abode. Swedenborg’s descriptions of hell are interspersed within various chapters of his monumental oeuvre. As an artist, he is a confirmedsquanderer who puts diamonds in dark chambers and plants oases inimpenetrable deserts. In some unforgettable scenes, a possibly tragic situation turns into mordant satire.

Instead of passing sentences, their duty is nowto put makeup on prostitutes, transforming hags into beauties. One day Swedenborg conferred with two angels about the power of imagination. Swedenborg argues that selfish and criminal people onearth hide their culpability to escape punishment, whereas these rascalsin the afterlife, unrestrained and uninhibited, have the time of theirlives. Because their imagination is unbridled, their instincts rage out ofcontrol. They turn into idiots who believe they own the whole world.These dolts don’t want to hear the truth, that pure egotism destroysboth mind and heart. They rave in their deliriums. Swedenborg and the angels regard each other. Let’s go down to hell and test your hypothesis, one angel says. Others warn Swedenborg thatthe illusory world of the damned might cause him to lose his own wits. They descend a stair and come to a house made of loose reed. It is surrounded by a mist, steam hissing from chinks in three of the walls.Inside fifty round-faced men are sitting, their eyes shining from a greenlight of greed. In front of every person is a table, and on top of eachtable are moneybags and gold coins. Each thinks he has the entire ex-chequer at his disposal. Swedenborg points out the absurdity of this notion because there are too many people present, but they explain that they are not allowed tothink “mine is not yours,” but only “yours is mine.” Light streams in through the cracks, making the treasures appear as grains of gold. The collective illusion makes coins out of dust. Whencecomes all this folly? Swedenborg wonders. They tell him they are awareof their stupidity, and when they leave the house, they become rationalagain. But as long as the illusion is maintained, it makes them happy, sothey gladly sit and indulge the fantasy. Epic of the Afterlife 111"

The fifty men in the dim hut havemany comrades, affected by the same delusions. Is not Swedenborg oneof them, although he is not greedy for gold? , Hell is composed of people who lack barriers. In one of his memorabilia[Apocalypse Revealed §655], Swedenborg is again in an amphitheater, thistime in the form of a gladiatorial circus. Satyrs and priapi sit on the low-est benches, some naked, others covered only slightly. Bulls, rams, sheep,kids, and lambs are driven into the arena, followed by lions, panthers,leopards, and wolves. In this theatrical scene, the wild animals, which have been conjured up in the satyr’s wicked hearts, represent lust. The beasts of prey attackthe innocent and peaceful grazing-animals, which represent decent andlaw-abiding people. A terrible massacre ensues. When the bloodbath isover, the satyrs strew sand over the place. In the Spiritual Diary , Swedenborg meets with a spirit who in the hour of death had thought of vampires and then been smitten with de-sire to suck other people’s blood to regain life. He hung aroundSwedenborg’s throat and stuck fast to the carotid artery. Swedenborg,who was protected, escaped the bloodsucker. The vampire spirit hadbeen awakened since Swedenborg was a human of flesh and blood. The special liking for evil, Swedenborg writes another day, can be compared to the sensual amusements of frogs in the stagnant water of apond or worms snacking on a cadaver. On the other hand, a predilec-tion for goodness is like refreshing your senses in gardens among flowerbeds. In both cases, we are concerned with pleasures. Those who desirefrog happiness think they chose it freely. These people are disregardedby Swedenborg because he himself does not have such tendencies or seethem as reasons for rejoicing. They, on the other hand, think they havedone the right thing.112 Olof Lagercrantz"

This ex- change took place in Lund in 1716, when the king returned from exilein T urkey. Swedenborg humbly tried to win the autocrat’s favor. He hadproduced the first scientific journal in Sweden, Daedalus Hyperboreus, inwhich he published his own sketch of “a machine to fly in the air,” andhoped his majesty would take an interest in this venture. The pilotshould not worry too much, the young inventor wrote, if he lost an armor a leg on the first flights. He placed his trust in the valor of pioneers.In his youth, Swedenborg too had his share of audacity. The king appointed Swedenborg assessor in the College of Mines, which initiated and controlled the mining industry in Sweden. Thisroyal assignment determined Swedenborg’s fate for three decades. Heinherited several mines in the Bergslag, but as far as is known he neverexperienced any conflict of interest between owning private propertyand performing his official duties. When Swedenborg meets the monarch in the spiritual world, he no longer needs to be as slavishly polite as he had been in his youth. He de-scribes the potentate as released from all the considerations and scruplesthat hinder despots in our world. Charles now plots to conquer theworld and control the minds of all people. Human lives are nothing tohim. Even in heaven he wants to be king.

We are not aware of the internal mem- ory during our lifetime; but without it, we couldn’t think. The inwardmemory flows into our conscious memory as a liquid pours into con-nected vessels. All that we have heard, seen, and experienced since our earliest child- hood and up to our last sigh is stored in the interior memory. Nothingis ever lost. Even our most shadowy perceptions remain, and in theother life, they emerge. Today, we use the term “the unconscious” to describe Swedenborg’s internal memory. He is a forerunner in the field of psychoanalysis. In-ternal memory is active in our dreams, and in this way it influences usalso when we are awake. When the human being after death is transformed into a spirit, in- ternal memory becomes the most important source of knowledge. 115"

Now, after our passage to the other side, the superiority of the inter- nal memory becomes apparent. Swedenborg uses the following exam- ple. Think of a friend or enemy you have known for several years andwith whom you have discussed a number of things. When you arealone, you try to recollect the person’s features, but the visual picture isblurred. How different then in the other life, when you have completeaccess to the internal memory and its superior retrieval system. Thereyou can observe your friend or adversary in detail and with the finestacuity and definition perceive his or her movements, facial expressions,scents, intonation, and diction. Alas! How much I wish such a refined memory were now mine, that all my lost loved ones would appear before me! Still, Swedenborg isright—in dreams, our memory can draw lifelike portraits where eventhe smallest characteristic is present. The dead return and appear beforeour eyes as if they were alive. In one scene among the dead, a young man complains that his mem- ories of love are fading, that the colors and redolence of his hours ofdalliance are losing their vividness, and that he finds it hard to believethat another kind of liaison awaits him. Although it remains, externalmemory is often banned, since it can be equivocal and deceptive. If thespirits were engrossed in these earthly memories, they might stop maturing and risk becoming silly. When a spirit grows in wisdom and develops into an angel, the exte- rior memory gradually fades away and finally disappears completely.Earthly life gives way to heavenly existence. Names of persons andplaces are forgotten. Swedenborg tells us of a spirit who could not remember where he came from. Swedenborg, the experienced traveler, takes him to towns and cities, one after another; and through his bodily eyes, Swedenborgshows the spirit distant streets and squares. Finally, they reach the citywhere the man had lived, and immediately he knows his way about.116 Olof Lagercrantz"

When memory is purified, the light from which we originate and to- ward which we are heading grows stronger. Memory houses this light. Swedenborg is peculiarly specific about everything. He can hilari- ously show us how difficult the dead find it to leave their past. One dayin November 1748, as recounted in the Spiritual Diary , a spirit comes to Swedenborg’s dinner table, longing for food—macaroons, pears, suc-culent doves. On this particular day, obviously, Swedenborg was enjoy-ing a feast in the spirit’s taste, making an exception from hiswell-known spartan repasts. The spirit thinks it can enjoy the deliciousfood if Swedenborg just consents to act as intermediary, but Sweden-borg believes this is forbidden. The hungry spirit has a long way tomarch to reach heaven. Of course, the spirit is Swedenborg himself. On another occasion, Swedenborg and some spirits discuss the na- ture of life. Life is will and understanding, one of them says. But, an-other objects, people who do not worry about truth and goodness stillthink they live intensely. They deny the inner light and feel just fine. Tothis it is replied that those light-hearted pleasure-seekers are spirituallydead. Enjoyments have been an obstacle in their rational development,and in the next life, they easily fall a victim to evil impulses. Swedenborg is quite generous in providing death certificates to those he finds spiritually dead. In a late entry in The Spiritual Diary [5711], he states that once, when his inner sight was opened, he had seen thestreet Stora Nygatan in the Old Town. This is one of the rare occasionswhen Stockholm appears in his writings. It is almost as if he were a dis-ciple of Strindberg, who in his work Sömngångarnätter (Sleepwalker Nights) has a bird’s-eye view of Stockholm and watches the crowdedstreets from above. The angels guide Swedenborg down the cobblestonestreet, and they observe that all the inhabitants are spiritually dead. Theangels shiver in the lane.

In spite of the throng of people surrounding them everywhere they go, the angels find the streets and the squares deserted since theycan perceive only those who are spiritually alive. The spirits wonder what makes the human being human? Witless people believe the body and the face are its chief characteristics,Swedenborg observes. Less fatuous souls believe the ability to speak isthe distinctive feature. Still others say that humans are distinguished bythought. They are all mistaken. The distinctive human quality is moralawareness, the aptitude to behold the Divine, which is internal in thehuman. It does not matter if you look like a human being and can talkand think like one: if you are full of falsehood and evil, you are nothuman. The human race left to its own devices is worse than animals be- cause it surrenders itself to destruction. Animals live according to theorder of providence, whereas humans go against the grain. If the Lorddid not have mercy on our species and had not connected it to himselfthrough the angels, humanity would not survive. But humans are notaware of this fact. The function of memory can be compared to the way cattle chew cud. As long as the food stays there, it is not part of the body; but whenit comes up, it gives life. T ruths concealed in the memory act in thesame way. Swedenborg’s attitude toward memory changes. Sometimes he says the dead do not remember anything at all. But a reader who looks invain for further explanations should not hold Swedenborg accountablefor this: an author is sovereign in his poetic universe. Swedenborg him-self brings all his memories to the spiritual world. Once it happens thatspirits overwhelm his memory. There they see a servant whom Sweden-borg has not remunerated properly. Swedenborg is indignant because heknows he has paid the man and has dreamt about it, but in his externalmemory this has been erased, and as a result the spirits accuse him.118 Olof Lagercrantz"

Once, when we were talking about an acquaintance of ours whose son had tragically killed himself, my friend objected: “But he isrich!” This was the starting point for an extended discussion, to which we now and again returned. Could a rich person really be depressed by sor-rows comparable to the misery of those lacking food and housing forthemselves and their families? My friend never changed his mind onthis point. “Do you mean that a mother with a dead child in her arms would suffer less if she is well-to-do?” I asked. But all in vain, and the issue hasoften upset me since then because money creates a wall between the selfand reality. At least in theory, our time esteems social empathy as a virtue and is suspicious of riches. That stand is considered Christian. Swedenborg,however, qualifies Jesus’ warning about the camel and the eye of theneedle. The rich, he assures us, have an equal or better chance of attain-ing heaven compared to the poor. , One day in the ethereal world, the angels observe that Swedenborg is de-jected (True Christian Religion §848) and ask him the reason. He replies that he has offered humankind a knowledge that exceeds anything hith-erto known, but people say it has no value. The angels are surprised to hear this and ask God’s permission to look down on earth to see what is going on. This is granted, but theysee nothing but darkness. Someone, perhaps Swedenborg himself, asksthem to write down the truths, which he has revealed, on a piece ofpaper and drop it down from heaven. The paper shines like a star aslong as it traverses spiritual space, but when it approaches earth, thewriting becomes obscured and hardly legible. On earth, some learnedclergymen catch it. “Why, this is just figments of the brain,” they assert, crumpling up the paper and stepping on it. The angels sadly witness this scene. 120 Olof Lagercrantz"

There is muchloneliness behind this, and he felt this deeply. This also explains whythere is no coherent plot to his narrative. He sprinkles his best partshere and there throughout his entire production, so the reader is forcedto wander through a desert of words before he comes to a refreshingoasis. Thus, Swedenborg’s renown rests upon the work of translatorsand interpreters. Although he rarely makes use of it, he has an exceptional knack of telling stories, and at times he allows himself to write with real panache,as in the following [from True Christian Religion §672]: It is easily seen that if you wash your face, your hands, and your feet, yes, washing your whole body in a bath, the dirt is washedaway; and you can show yourself among people, clean and neat.And that’s it. It does not make you any better. Any thief, brig-and, or murderer can take a bath and scrub himself until heshines. This is just an empty show; the soul is not purified. The inward exerts an influence on the external appearance and has its way. But the outward cannot affect the internal—that would be against nature and to upset divine order. 4 ,Epic of the Afterlife 125 3. Pär Lagerkvist (1891–1974) was a Swedish novelist, playwright, and poet, who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1951. Love, death, and eternity were his constant themes.4.

When they meet, he tells them that his father-hood is ended and that God is now their father. Father and son depart,determined never to think of one another anymore. But if the father’s soul is still attached to the earth, he embraces his children and never tires of seeing them and talking to them. If such fa-thers are told that their children did much harm in their life, withoutfurther ado, they gather the entire family, and all descend to the lowerdepths. This is far from, too far from, Jesus’ story of the prodigal son. , When we arrive in the world of spirits, no one asks about our faith; weare asked only about our life. On earth, the same question is crucial.This is in accordance with the thesis “faith without deeds is dead.” Do not humans have, Swedenborg asks ( True Christian Religion §375), a head and body, connected by the neck? Does not the bodycarry out the will and thought of the head? What is the use of good in-tentions in the head if the body does not act accordingly but remainspassive? The thoughts would be like homeless birds that, lacking a nest,lay their eggs in the air to be cracked against the ground. A person whokeeps love and faith to him- or herself is a specter hovering in vacantspace, a flitting butterfly swallowed by a sparrow. How we live, the alertness of the internal human, determines our fate on the other side of the grave. Sometimes it turns out that the person isalready dead when he or she dies. I think nobody, without shudderinginwardly, can reject this idea—that our soul can be lost.

If, on the other hand,he roots out the whole Christendom, but the intention of his campaignis good, then he should be rewarded. Voltaire, the moral oracle of the era, whom Swedenborg must have had constantly before his eyes, loudly objects: it does not matterwhether we are well-disposed or mean: the result counts. The worstruler whose most notorious decisions make his country prosper shouldbe lauded. Against Swedenborg’s extremely personal demands, Voltaireputs public interest, and few of us would disapprove. I suspect that anunconscious abhorrence of Christianity directs Swedenborg’s choice ofexamples. In another respect, he sided with Voltaire. Voltaire didn’t carein the least for the endless prayers of the hermit in barren land, unlessthe recluse did something for his fellow beings. , In Swedenborg, temptation (Lat. tentatio; Swedish frestelse ) is a recurrent term. As can be seen from J. F . Potts’s concordance, the term, in Sweden-borg’s usage, signifies trial, probation, suffering, affliction, and passion.In his writings, as elsewhere, the context determines the actual meaning. Swedenborg calls the Flood, which drowned biblical humanity, a temptation of Noah. Humans are not drowning in the waters; profaneand evil thoughts are. The water level sinks, and raven and dove are sentout to find land. At this point, Noah’s temptation—the inundation—isover. As long as it lasts, doubt and despair reigns, symbolized by drown-ing people and animals. When it is all over, Noah is relieved and com-forted, and the symbolic flood stops. An uncorrupted person cannot be tempted. Temptation presupposes weakness. The temptation of Jesus shows that he was not one with Goduntil he overcame his last temptation—dying on the cross. Temptation is the first sign of regeneration. During this process, the angels and demons are at war inside us. Our anxiety is the work of evilspirits (Arcana Coelestia §5036).

Follow me to paradise, one of them suggests. There is, the angel continues, a gorgeous temple that can be seen only bythose who realize the limitation of their mind, whereas those who claimto be wise see nothing.

This argument makes them furious,however, and they declare that allusions to their incapacities will nolonger be tolerated. The frenzied jealousy of these outsiders has few parallels in our literature. , The tablets containing the Law, acquired by Moses on Mount Sinai,were two in number. One tablet concerns relations between humankindand God, while the other deals with human relations. If an individualfulfills the requirements of the human code, the Lord affords that personthe ability to answer to the decrees found on his tablet. A murderer, athief, an adulterer, or a perjurer cannot possibly love the Lord at thesame time. That would be unreasonable, Swedenborg states. Dostoevsky has shown us that a criminal can love the Lord, and Swedenborg here may appear strange and severe. 5Legal technicalities frequently arise, and Swedenborg often expresses the conviction that atrue belief in God is a sure protection against evil tendencies. Nevertheless, Swedenborg feels compassion for those who believe they are lost. That happened to him one time. All things considered, his spiri-tual doctrine is an education in happiness. When Cain, who killed hisbrother, confesses that his wicked deed is too heavy for him to bear, hisremnant of goodness becomes visible. When the Lord put a mark on Cain,it meant that, if he were slain, vengeance would be taken on his murderersevenfold, because it is forbidden to do violence to the unhappy. ,Epic of the Afterlife 129 5.

Swedenborg terms this driving force in humankinddivine providence. The true nature of this progressive desire to achieve isunknown because we want to think that our advance is voluntary andself-willed. Still, we believe in a providence that links our fates. Swedenborg refers to an experience from parlor games [Divine Providence §212]: Gamble with dice or play cards or ask someone who is familiar with these things. What gambler would deny the existence ofluck? They actually play with it, and it plays with them in a won-derful way. Who can achieve anything if there has been a turn offortune? When we attempt to contravene, does not fortune thenlaugh at wisdom and prudence? When you roll the dice, shuffleand deal the cards, is it not then as if luck oversaw and directedthe turns and the twists of the wrist to favor, for some reason, oneor the other partner at the table? Can the basic reason be any-thing but, ultimately, divine providence, which secretly acts uponus through various dispensations, long-term as well as short-term? Luck is neither a delusion nor a freak of nature. Our ideaof Fortuna and her interventions in our lives indicates the pres-ence of God in our thoughts and actions. In a recent article, Swedish author Henning Mankell compares the extremely popular television program of the late 1950s, the highly in- tellectual quiz 10,000-kronorsfrågan, to its 1990s counterpart Bin- golotto.6In the former, the competitors were amateurs with special knowledge in different fields—Roman Catholic Popes, for example—and those who passed all the rounds and finally won the money wereapplauded by the whole nation. But in the more recent game, thebingo, the lottery is based on “blind luck.” Everything hinges on thelottery number and whether the indicator will land on that number.130 Olof Lagercrantz 6.

And if it is thatwhat it’s all about, it is all about nothing at all. Haven’t people whotrust in fortune always been a bit resigned?” Swedenborg and Mankell face each other. Perhaps the bingo players are waiting for God. The divine moment comes for everyone some day. , In the Arcana Coelestia, Swedenborg closely reads the thirty-ninth chap-ter of Genesis. It is about Mrs. Potiphar’s attempt to seduce the hand-some young Joseph, who is a trusted employee in her Egyptianhusband’s house. Potiphar’s wife says to Joseph, “Sleep with me,” andJoseph rejects her. She persists, and one day when the house is empty,she appealingly grips his garment. Strangely enough, in his observations on this scene of temptation, Swedenborg does not see the erotic tension, which Thomas Mann in hisseries of biblical novels written two hundred years later was to adornwith spicy detail. Swedenborg always seems to be on guard against anysuspicion that earthly adventures have incidentally made God forget hisreal purpose, the instruction of humanity. When Swedenborg in his ex-egesis eventually faces the Song of Solomon, with its kisses, caresses, en-dearments, and alluring fragrances, his explanations no longer suffice,and he promptly declares that this particular biblical book was not writ-ten by God.

All his life he lives alone;we know next to nothing about his love affairs. When, in his old age,women called on him, he always asked that another person be present,whether to avoid gossip and slander or temptation. Yet he describes mat-rimonial love with an affection unmatched in Swedish literature. In thisrespect, he is the antithesis of Strindberg, yet he himself had no experi-ence of marriage. Swedenborg devoted a comprehensive work to this subject, Conju- gial Love , which was published in London in 1768. It consists of two parts: The Delights of Wisdom concerning Conjugial Love, and Plea-sures of Insanity concerning Scortatory Love. In eighteenth-centurySweden, hor(whoredom) signified carnal knowledge between a married person and an unmarried one and, even worse, extramarital relations 132"

In for- mer days, such adulterous relations were a crime called dubbelt hor, for a long time considered a penal offense. Today, the word hor still retains something of its old and robust sense of sinfulness, but in sophisticatedcircles, it has been transferred to other areas. To the young, whore has sexual connotations, but also pertains to working life: to do somethinghateful just for the money. Journalists are familiar with the term. In Swedish translations, the adjective horisk is used to describe the baser kind of love that Swedenborg analyzes in the second part of hisbook, drawn from the Latin words scortatorius, fornicatorius, andmere- tricius. His writings swarm with such illicit love. The eighteenth century has acquired some notoriety for licentious- ness and loose living. But this pertains mostly to the royal courts andhigh society. With the rank and file, it was probably as it has alwaysbeen—coarse sensuality, rudeness, prudishness, and artificiality in a va-riety of blends. Swedenborg is harsh and practical and takes the ordi-nary view on gender. He thinks that connubial delights are as superiorto other erotic pleasures as springtime excels the Nordic winter. But hedoesn’t condemn an unmarried man who, owing to his urgent desire,keeps a mistress—granted that she is not a virgin and he does not enticeher with a promise of marriage. In populous societies, brothels ought tobe established, he suggests, although stressing that it is always preferablethat sexual fire be ignited in married life. Women who are mistresses orwork at those brothels are all beyond his ken, which tend to confirmthe suspicion that they do not belong to “mankind.” In a dark forest, Swedenborg meets with satyrs who have hairy chests [Conjugial Love §521]. Some of them are cloven-footed; others have paws like panthers or wolves. They run about, inspired by burning de-sire, shouting, “Where are the women?” Scarlet women are waiting for them, and the satyrs take them to a subterranean cavern.

He then refers to the episode in Homer’s Odyssey where Circe—by a slip of tongue, Swedenborg calls her Medea—trans-forms Ulysses’ men into swine. Swedenborg explains that this did not inreality come to pass but illustrates the men’s lechery. An interesting discussion follows, resembling Swedenborg’s conversa- tion with the incubus who had such a beautiful paramour. Don’t theyknow that scortatory love is iniquitous? Are they not familiar with thesixth commandment? They reply: Should a children’s book plot the lifeof adults? Have you not heard divines preach on the righteous life,Swedenborg retorts.

Now some farm work-ers are preparing land for reclamation, and he hears a voice from heavencalling to him: “Go to your bedroom, and shut the door.

Her face and her body make her superior in beauty, and in herdemeanor she is closer to life. Her amorous life is aimed in one direc-tion, since she is responsible for the offspring. When she grows up, she longs for a lasting love relation. But she conceals her wish because she knows that men treasure their freedomand for this reason are chilled by women who want to bind them. A woman’s love is primary, men’s love merely secondary, since a man is a receptacle without knowing it. The female says to the male she haschosen, “How clever you are!” In the same instant, a flame is kindled inher eyes, she reddens, and warmth streams down into her heart. Theman suddenly sees how attractive she is and replies, “How beautiful youare!” Then a love relationship is established; and if the two are lucky,this lasts for life.

Thencecomes the joy felt immediately after coition, instead of despondency ason earth. Furthermore, the partners are recompensed with youthfulnessand increased powers. Soon, they have regained all the sexual stamina oftheir youth. Is Swedenborg’s observation that one feels ill at ease after intercourse based on his own experiences acquired during his travels and probablevisits to brothels? On the other hand, when he talks about spiritualeroticism, he is strangely childlike and innocent. We are invited to en-gage in intercourse where erotic hunger is transformed into a state ofcommunity, a transubstantiation act in a bodily Communion.

It does not originate in Eros but in a desire forwisdom (Arcana Coelestia §2727 f.) Our sexual drive is only a vehicle for this desire. T rue love certainly begins with sexual attraction; but in sensual exhil- aration, the divine unity of Love and Wisdom is covertly implanted.The prerequisite for fulfillment is a desire for monogamy. When lovetruly takes root in the male, the sexual urge is transformed. Then Erosis not before the man, but behind him. Sexual desire is preserved, but itbecomes chaste and even sweeter than before. In this way, Swedenborg frees us from the captivity of our natural de- sires. But this liberation becomes even more paradoxical since this is asphere of human life that more than anything else appears to be subjectto natural laws. Swedenborg’s conjugial love is a dream that unitesheaven and earth. It puts a golden pattern in our lives. It lets heavencome into marriage. Marital love, as Swedenborg describes it, is lifelongand can only be alive with one partner. It is a love that holds sexual at-traction and erotic pleasures but is rooted first and foremost in a pro-found spirit of community. , One day when Swedenborg is “inspirited,” he asks to be introduced to acouple from the Golden Age [Conjugial Love §75]. An angel appears andpromises that his wish shall be fulfilled, but—as if he had read Dante—at the same time warns him that the route is full of hardships and passesthrough a dark and foreboding forest where no one can find his waywithout a guide authorized by the Lord. After an adventurous ramble, Swedenborg and the accompanying soul arrive at one of the luxuriant orchards that frame otherworldlyblessedness. There the happy couple greets them, the husband dressedin hyacinth-colored cloak and a waistcoat of shining wool, his wife cladin purple toga with an embroidered silk vest beneath.

      "text": "Swedenborg likes to write about clothes. He is the sophisticated spirit’s tailor, dressing up people in the most elegant garbs. Like all other things in heaven, garments are not substantial in a worldly fash-ion but are reflections of the condition of those who wear them and areinterlaced with symbolical meanings. Undoubtedly, Swedenborg hadread Stiernhielm’s Hercules, where Lady Lust is rigged out in exquisiteapparel, while Lady Chaste dresses like a Puritan. Nevertheless Sweden-borg attires the angels according to their level of wisdom. The brightestwear a glistening cloth, looking as if it flashes with fire. The less well-in-formed have slightly duller outfits, completely without glare, and theleast advanced spirits wear costumes of mixed colors like harlequins. Inthe innermost heaven, however, the angels are naked, since nudity is thestate of innocence. Titian’s famous painting Sacred and Profane Love,where the worldly woman is splendidly dressed but the divine is nude,is here borne out. An spiritual woman in love changes gown continually as she turns to her beloved. If a man or a woman gets a stain on their clothes, it signi-fies a defect or a sin surfacing from within. The spot disappears whenthe wearer’s fault is ameliorated. When Swedenborg meets with the blissful pair from the Golden Age, his eye goes from one to the other, to and fro, and he observes how theunity of their souls is mirrored in their faces, exactly as he had expected. “You are two and yet you are one,” he says. The man answers, “We are one. Her life is in me and my life is in her. We are two bodies andone soul. There is a union between us as between the two fonts in thechest, called heart and lung. She is my heart and I am her lung.” Swedenborg the bachelor is moved by these beautiful words, but still he harbors a doubt. Are there no clouds in this married sunshine? Canthe husband really look at other women without desire? The manreplies, “I can. Since my wife is united with my soul, we see everythingat one and the same time. When encountering other women, I see themthrough her eyes. She guides my thoughts and instills coldness anddread of the unchaste.” This is an ingenious way of preventing escapades. 142 Olof Lagercrantz"

A boy and a girl who have fallen in love have the opportunity— during the time of engagement, in the solemn wedding ceremony, andon the honeymoon—to see divine love reborn. Anyone who has experienced a love of that kind knows that any im- pulse heading in another direction than the beloved dies in one’sbreast. The heart screens the surrounding world and its manifoldtemptations, and our sexual urge exists only in the presence of thebeloved. The feeling is close to religious ecstasy. Those who experiencethis live within a two-tongued flame of fire and do not exist outside it(Conjugial Love §58).Epic of the Afterlife 143"

      "text": "18 APOCALYPSE In the late fifteenth century, Albrecht Dürer created his famous wood- cut series “The Apocalypse,” which depicted the four riders found in Revelation 6, the heralds of destruction. Swedenborg has an equine predilection akin to that of Dürer. Horses of all colors trot and gallopthrough his works. The white horse of Revelation 19 is the starting pointfor one of his best pieces, the small work On the White Horse, published in 1758. “Now I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse. And He who sat on him was called Faithful and T rue, and in righteousness He judges and makes war.” With these words, Revelation 19:11 begins. In verses12–14 we read: His eyes were like a flame of fire, and on His head were many crowns. He had a name written that no one knew except Himself. 144"

      "text": "He was clothed with a robe dipped in blood, and His name is called The Word of God. And the armies in heaven, clothed in fine linen, white and clean, followed Him on white horses. It is impossible to understand this without knowing the internal meaning, Swedenborg writes. Who would contradict this statement? Swedenborg, intrepid as always, immediately begins his explication. Heexplains that the white horse symbolizes the intellectual penetrationinto the inner sanctum of the Word, stating this as a fact, which meansthat the subject is really his own powers of interpreting the Bible. TheLord himself is on horseback. The flames issuing from his eyes signifydivine truth and love. The secret name written upon him, known tonone but himself, is “The Word of God.” Here it is shown that theLord has clothed himself in the Word, the Holy Writ proper. His gar-ment drenched in blood indicates that the letter of the Word has beenviolated. The mounted escort, clothed in fine linen and following himon white horses, is conscripted among those who firmly grasp the inte-rior sense. Unstated yet understood tacitly by the reader is that Swedenborg points the way for the riders, having unlocked the Bible by his interpre-tation. The three verses mean that, someday in the future, the internalsense of the Word will prevail. For Swedenborg, the horse is a cherished symbol. As a deputy of the Board of Mines and as the author of a book on foundries and minerals,he has crossed the country time and again in horse-drawn conveyanceor on horseback. The horse was part of his life. While it is an ancientsymbol of strength and freedom, for Swedenborg, the horse principallyrepresents intellectual life. A horseman understands. But the assump-tion is that the horse is white. White is connected with truth. The light of God is white, and the clothing of angels is white. There is no fairer image of innocence thanthe white lamb. Whiteness is a gift of God, and wherever it appears, itaffirms the Lord’s presence. For this reason, the horse is white.

      "text": "other color is suspect. When a white dress is soiled or discolored, this is a mark of moral impurity. A dead horse is a horrible representation ofdenial and misunderstanding. A horse in captivity is reason imprisoned. The other three horses of Dürer’s foursome symbolize lost under- standing. The scarlet horse signifies lost goodness. Red is good, butflaming red is disastrous. The horse of such a color annihilates peace.The black horse signals falsehood because black is the opposite of thewhite. Finally, the fourth horse, the sickly pale one, needs no interpre-tation, its name being Death. On one occasion [Apocalypse Revealed §839], Swedenborg observes a herd of red and black horses rushing forward. Monkeys ride them, sit-ting with their backs to the horses’s heads. They attack white horses. Swedenborg’s makes full use of his collection of Bible quotations in proving that the horse in Scripture always has the same signification.The words on riding upon the Word of truth found in the Psalms;Habakkuk’s horses and triumphant chariots; and the prophet Elijah’s as-cent by horse and chariot bolster his argument. Swedenborg also knowsfrom experience that this interpretation is true because horses, riders,and carriages are often seen in the spiritual world. Contemplative spir-its, lost in thought, suddenly, without knowing how, find themselves inthe saddle. A field seems to contain an endless number of chariots andhorses. New arrivals in the spiritual world are taught that this is not realbut an appearance produced by all the intellectual work going on. Theplace is called the assembly of the intelligent and wise. Swedenborg alsohad seen some people ascend with shining horses and fiery chariots, up-lifted to heaven by the truths of doctrine. Not finding biblical evidence enough, Swedenborg shows that even the sages of antiquity knew equestrian symbolism. They imagined thatthe sun, the very emblem of enlightenment and wisdom, is a chariotdrawn by horses. Accordingly, the ancients envisaged the winged horsePegasus, whose hoof opened the spring of the nine muses. Anotherproof is the famous T rojan Horse, symbolizing the intellect’s power oftearing down walls. This art of symbol excites me. I find irresistible. It is wonderful to146 Olof Lagercrantz"

One is carried along by Swedenborg’s voracious search fora meaning, with the horses, the trees, and the stars disclosing Holy Writbehind all. I don’t know if Swedenborg was familiar with Gulliver’s voyage to the land of the Houyhnhnms, where the horses are endowed with reasonbut human beings are not. The horses are wise rulers. Of the all thebooks of Gulliver’s Travels , published in England in 1726, this one is the least known. In this particular travel journal, Swift’s misanthropy cul-minates when he describes human beings, the dirty Yahoos, who offersuch a frightful contrast to their noble four-hooved masters. Sweden-borg’s horse-filled imaginary fields fit well in Swift’s world, however;and deep down in the gloomy grottos of his hell, many spirits resembleYahoos. Swift, however, does not share Swedenborg’s taste for vivid colors. Gulliver’s host in the country of the horses is dapple-gray, and his sub-ordinate is a brown bay. But there is a beautiful white mare too. In all,there are noteworthy similarities in Swift’s satire. As on Swedenborg’sJupiter, doubts and disbelief are unknown in the land of the Houy-hnhnms. Science is disregarded since wisdom is inherited from genera-tion to generation, and therefore books are not needed. , The Revelation of John is the strangest book in the Bible and offers achallenge to Swedenborg. He identifies with John of Patmos, who intro-duces himself in the first verse. Both of them see a door opened inheaven when they are caught up “in the spirit” (Rev. 4:2). John of Patmos tells that his errand is to show “what must shortly take place” and foreshadows the end of the world as have thousands ofprophets through the ages: “The time is near.” Swedenborg wrenches the time bomb loose from John’s hands, at the same time disarming the worldly sting in his words. Swedenborg explains that the word near does not refer to time, becauseEpic of the Afterlife 147"

      "text": "to God there is no time. Rather, it signifies a state. God, who is all mercy, would not permit destruction of the world in the external sense.If God had meant to set out the limits of time, it all would have beenover long ago. “The time is near” indicates preparedness for an im-mense change, a vigilance of the soul. The same hermeneutic method is applied to the famous prophesies and warnings in Matthew. When Jesus tells his disciples of forthcomingdisasters preceding the Last Judgment—earthquakes, famine, civil war,the sunning turning dark, and the stars falling from the sky—none ofthis is meant literally. Just as the creation narrative in Genesis is aboutthe regeneration of a soul, the doomsday descriptions in Matthew andJohn relate to a failing civilization and a devastated soul. The Book of Revelation offers the most fantastic and anguished drama. No wonder today’s rock bands take their words and symbolsfrom that source. Like the Book of Revelation, their lyrics have a world-wide reach and rouse their audience to ecstasy. Swedenborg feels more at home in the apocalyptic context than any- where else, but ecstasy is alien to him, and he never permits himself tobe lured away from his general method: everything is an image and asymbol. When he gets to the strange scene in Revelation 12, where apregnant woman, robed with the sun and with a crown of twelve starson her head, cries out in anguish to be delivered of her labor and adragon with seven heads and ten horns places himself in front of her,ready to devour the child at the moment of delivery, he conveys nosense of the overwhelming anxiety and the evasive mystery of thedrama. Cool as a cucumber, he explains that the woman in travail is hisown doctrine that is brought forth and that the dragon corresponds tothe Protestant churches, which by “faith alone” wish to gorge on anderadicate his teachings. In this manner, the Book of Revelation becomes a rebus to decipher and loses its complexity. Swedenborg raises his claims by regarding theholy city of Jerusalem which John of Patmos saw coming down fromheaven—with its streets of gold and gates of pearls—as an image of hisown blessed teachings. This is rather strange.148 Olof Lagercrantz"

      "text": "Millions of Christian believers have seen the New Jerusalem as the end of their lives and long for the day when they shall march in. “He has opened the gate of pearl”—this is the first words of a hymn the Sal-vation Army often sings, full of implicit faith. Swedenborg connectsthis longing with that moment God will wipe away all tears and sorrowand pain will be no more; but he completely rejects this sentimentality.The reasonable interpretation of the biblical symbols is all that matters. Much more fruitful is Swedenborg’s construal of the Apocalypse as symbolic of the devastation and salvation of a soul, or an account of thedisintegration, destruction, and renaissance of a civilization. Since the dawn of humanity, there have been four churches on earth, Swedenborg says. They can also be called covenants between hu-mankind and God. These churches correspond to the mythical ages ofgold, silver, copper, and iron. The first three of them have already hadtheir “last day.” The oldest church serves as a model for all the others.During that era, God and humanity were closely connected, and thehuman race lived in harmony and neighborly love. But the spiritualbody deteriorated, and the divine truths were forgotten. Self-compla-cency then flourished in the congregation. This oldest church was sym-bolically ended by the Flood, not as a drowning catastrophe but as asign of moral degradation and spiritual ruin. In the world of correspon-dences, water represents human decadence and devastation. Swedenborg closely chronicles the course of events step by step. When the rain stops, Noah sends out a raven from the ark; its returnmeans that souls were still in decline. But when he then sends out adove, which returns with a green leaf, this signifies a new life germinat-ing in people’s hearts. This is the dawn of the new covenant, and therainbow glows in the sky. A new epoch begins with Moses after the Egyptian bondage. The coming of Christ was another rebirth after an era of degeneration andtorment. Now, in the Iron Age, the modern era, the time has come foranother destruction. This is prefigured by the powerful symbols in theBook of Revelation. The Last Judgment takes place in society and within every individual.Epic of the Afterlife 149"

Devastation takes place within all of us. Doomsday is not a catas-trophe at the end of time. It is here and now. In Swedenborg’s character, there is a trait of robust karolin , a Swedish soldier of Charles XIIwho returned from Siberian captivity and now teaches in a wintry Sweden. The expanses of the Russian taiga are re- tained in his vast perspective, but there is also something solid andnumb. The magnificent stage-settings of the Apocalypse show us again how rich is the human heart and how far is the reach of human imaginationand emotion.150 Olof Lagercrantz"
