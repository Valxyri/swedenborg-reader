      "text": "xi< PREFACE > Memories of my early childhood home reﬂect the creativity of a family friend, the artist-poet Alice Archer Sewall James (1870–1955). Several portraits she had painted hung on our walls; she hand-carved the stand for the open Bible, representing the presence of the divine so important in a Swedenborgian household; at Christmastime her silhouettes of the Three Kings’ visit to Bethlehem decorated our living room windows. Although we children called her Aunt Archie, she instructed our parents to call her “Mrs. James.” In the small Ohio town of Urbana, where we lived until I was six, I recall walking with my mother and younger brother to Aunt Archie’s house to sit for our portrait. Oddly, I remem-ber nothing of its creation, for my memory focuses on my two-year-old brother collecting small green apples in the very basket he holds in the painting. When I was six, we moved to Massachusetts, where some of Archie’s distinctive creations were again present in the form of various early childhood portraits of my brot her and myself, the carved Bible stand, and the silhouetted manger scene that again graced our living room windows every Christmas. When I was twelve, Aunt Archie did another portrait of me. She selected a smocked yellow dress that I considered unduly childish and posed me in an uncomfortable position, hold-ing a vase of freesias. I indeed felt relieved when the portrait was completed. At the same time she did a portrait of Lewis Hite, the philosophy professor at the Swedenborgian theologi-cal school in Cambridge. She wanted to get the expression she had observed on Mr. Hite’s face as he was explaining some-"

Y ears later, however, when I was doing a longitudinal study on women’s careers—which required visits to the participants every ﬁve years—I was inspired to investigate one woman’s life in its entirety. Whose life would it be? As often happens in women’s lives, serendipity prevailed. After my parents died, it fell to me to prepare their home for sale. In a dark corner of the attic I found a box of papers written years before by Aunt Archie. When I took them to the archives of the Swedenborgian church, I learned t hat a similar package had recently arrived from Archie’s goddaughter along with a letter suggesting that someone should write her biography.

As a news reporter once summarized, “She painted, she danced, she wrote, she taught: more than anything else, Alice Archer Sewall James spent her life creating.” Consider some of the accomplishments that interested me— her namesake—in the study of Archie’s life: < By the time she was thirty, Archie’s Portrait of Cornelia had been accepted in Paris by the prestigious Salon de Mai for exhibition at the Musée de Louvre. T oday, a century later, portraits by Archie are treasured possessions in homes from Maine to California. < She received national acclaim for her 1904 painting The Holy Family, created when she was in her thirties. The work was selected as one of three noteworthy contem-porary American Christmas paintings presented in the December 12, 1909, Sunday Arts section of the New Y ork Herald. < In her sixties, in 1934, Archie founded the Urbana Movement, offering affordable instruction in the arts in her hometown. An average of thirty students attended these classes, depositing whatever tuition they could afford in a box in the classroom. < In her seventies, upon scaffolds, Archie accepted com- missions to paint two wall-size murals in the chancels of two black churches in still-segregated Urbana. I found Archie to have been a writer as well as an artist. She left a legacy of poems and plays, some of which may be found today in the Library of Congress and in Swedenborgian archives. The plays, most written during her forties and ﬁfties when she was not able to paint, seemed to depict odd collec-tions of characters and plots until I realized they represented"

Among her poetry is a lengthy work entitled The W anderings of Eros written entirely in iambic pentameter. The title of my study, Stay by Me, Roses, comes from a poem Archie wrote when she was about sixty and had chosen some late-blooming roses as a symbol of her second painting career. Although she sensed and celebrated the return of her painting muse, she did not know when she invoked it that some twenty years of painting and teaching lay ahead of her. One of the questions facing me as a biographer was how to refer to an individual who preferred to be called Mrs. James but was not married until she was twenty-nine. Her par-ents and sisters called her Archie; her husband and childhood friends knew her as Alice. I chose to write of her as Archie even though she would not approve of such informality herself. As a child, I had collected many memories of the James fam- ily and their hometown, Urbana. But when I began to research Archie’s life, I discovered how little I actually knew about her. I learned that she was an unusually enterprising woman, much more career-involved than I had assumed women of her era to be. I also found, however, that she had encountered circum-stances that discouraged and challenged her when her prom-ising early caree r was cut short in 1906 by “nervous prostra- tion.” Her determined program to regain her health was an astounding discovery. The interpretations of Archie’s life are my own, based on her letters and writings and drawn from descriptions of her by friends, students, and family. This book shares what I have learned, which in many ways challenges stereotypes of women who lived in the ﬁrst half of the twentieth century. —Alice Blackmer Skinner St. George, Maine"

She was named for Frank’s youngest sister and favorite partner in piano duets, Alice Worcester Sewall. The family called her Archie based on her middle name, which was inspired by Alice Archer Dummer, six generations back in the Sewall genealogy. Archie’s parents met at a convention of the Swedenborgian church (also known as the Church of the New Jerusalem or New Church), a denomination founded on the teachings of Swedish theologian Emanuel Swedenborg (1688–1772). The convention was hosted at Thedia’s home church in Philadelphia and attended by Frank, the young minister of the church in Glendale, Ohio. They were married in October 1869 at the Staten Island home of Thedia’s Grandmother Cox. Thedia Sewall (1843–1924), the eldest child of William Wallace and Redelia Ann (née Cox) Gilchrist, was born in Jersey City, New Jersey. When she was nine, the family, including her siblings James, William, and Janet, moved to Philadelphia. Her brother James became a professor of surgery and homeopathy at the University of Iowa, and her brother Will was an organist, composer, choir director, and one of the founders of the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra. Frank Sewall (1837–1915) was born in Bath, Maine, the youngest son in a family of seven children. He came from a"

As a boy Frank wrote in his diary, “I can’t help think- ing which I shall be. I can’t decide. A painter? A poet? Or a pianist? I would like to be all three, but I cannot.” A sketch-book was always handy in his pocket. His piano skills were in demand at social gatherings, and while he was still in high school, he became the organist and choir director for the New Church society in Bath. After graduation from Bowdoin College in 1859, Frank’s father offered him a trip to visit his sister Marcia, who lived in Rome with her sculptor husband, Joseph Ropes. Frank lin-gered in Italy, learning Italian; going on sketching expeditions with an artist friend; studying history; sightseeing; reading Boccacio, Petrarch, and Dante; and falling in and out of love. As he explored, Frank was becoming interested in the minis- try. He visited Roman Catholic and Greek Orthodox worship services—which he considered “sacred drama”—and enjoyed the beauty of the windows of Gothic churches and the music of great orchestras. At Dresden he discovered Raphael’s Sistine Madonna; at Nurenberg he attended a Protestant service in a gothic church. His journals record a period of eager receptiv-ity, of sensitive response to impressions, especially those asso-ciated with art and the church. Frank traveled to Germany to study with Immanuel T afel, a Swedenborg scholar on the fac-ulty at the University of Tübingen, and to France to work with J. F. E. Le Boys des Guays, a translator of Swedenborg’s Latin into French. Returning home in 1862, Frank devoted another year to preparation for the ministry and then, in 1863, was ordained a Swedenborgian minister. Settling down in the parsonage at Glendale, Ohio, Frank Sewall continued with the habits of scholarship he had developed while a college student.

The trustees of Urbana University, searching for a president who was both a minister and scholar, invited him to take the helm at the college, which at that time was experiencing difﬁculties and in need of reor-ganization. As author Frank Higgins describes the situation: Frank Sewall arrived at Urbana determined to save the beleaguered University, but he faced a difﬁcult task. T wo decades of internal chaos and ﬁnancial problems had spent the energies of Urbana’s founders and left student morale at a low ebb. The school’s checkered past and uncertain future guaranteed Sewall the most formidable challenge of his career. 1 In October 1870, baby Archie and her parents moved to Urbana, seat of Champaign County in west-central Ohio, where Frank Sewall took up his duties as president of Urbana University and minister to the Swedenborgian congrega-tion there. The Sewalls settled into a frame house with a large yard a few blocks from the college. They remodeled the house to incorporate ideas gathered during Frank’s student days in Germany, placing a traditional motto over the ﬁreplace in the library, stained-glass Evangelists in the library windows, and busts of Swedenborg, Raphael, and Socrates over the book-cases. An oriel window and carved newel posts were added to the stairway, and a statue of Psyche was placed in the garden. Archie’s four sisters were born in this house: Maud Gilchrist in February 1872, Mary Redelia (Maidy) in October 1873, Rachel Kenyon (Ray) in July 1875, and Elizabeth T rufant (Bess) in October 1878. As small girls the Sewall children shared expressive activi- ties—music, dancing, play-making—with their parents. Both parents made music for and with the family, with Frank and Thedia on the piano, guitar, or cello. Memories of family play times are recorded by both Archie and Maidy. Archie’s rec-"

The memoir begins, Around the parlour, with its bare, waxed and inlaid ﬂoor, my little sisters and I sat awaiting the prelude to the dance to come to the pause, when my father, looking up from his ﬂying hands on the keyboard, would announce “Signorina Madelina,” or “Signorina Alicia,” or whoever out of the four was to be the performer of the pas seule. Then out the child would ﬂy to the center, in front of the coal grate, with the Sistine Madonna above it blessing the evening play, and my mother with the baby on her lap, clapping for the encore. The dances were to be expressive of the music, and no one could tell what that might be, as the improvisation poured out every mood, changing its beat and character from Largo to Vivace with dramatic suddenness. Maud, with her heavy curls, was noted among us for the rapidity of her tip-toes. The breathless joy ended all too soon in the goodnight kisses before going up to bed. 2 Maidy’s bittersweet story, recorded in a memory book dis- covered by her daughter, Elizabeth Weller Blair, recounts: Music with its Song and Dance . . . only three years old. My sister Archie led the way—She had her costume, a Black Net Shawl. My Mother was at the Piano. Rhythm was emphasized, grace and beauty led the little girl. Sometimes with a Song.

A Burst into T ears—when Baby Marietta stopped at her mother’s knee and sobbed, “I am not a Horse.”3 Despite occasional tears, evening play was a cherished part of the day for the Sewall children. Y ears later, in 1927, Archie wrote “Notes on the Making of a Home by a Child of Reverend and Mrs. Frank Sewall,” an essay on raising chil-dren prepared for a young mother, Carolyn Blackmer. The notes are organized around twelve “elements” Archie thought essential for the spiritual, emotional, and intellectual growth of children. Element number ten, called “Games and a Sense of Play,” suggests the range of activities the Sewall girls shared with their parents as well as the rationale for emphasizing a sense of play that would be valuable throughout life, especially when beset by hard times: Games and play should, except with very little ones, be reserved for special hours of the day, and be participated in heartily and sincerely by Father and Mother alike, if only for a very short time. This honoring of Play by parents opens the inmost regions of peace and charity. It should be developed from infant games on the ﬂoor or the lap, to physical play, dances and mimics, dramas, singing and declamations made out in programs spontaneously, (or pr earranged by the children), and later still into intellectual games of wit, ingenuity, taste and skill. Every kind of nonsense, funniness, cleverness, and all reachings after dimly felt expressions should here have full scope. No ridicule or discouragement should be permitted, and the laugh should always be with, not at, the performer."

These Swedenborgian parents fostered spiritual development through the way they conducted family life. “Notes on the Making of a Home” rep-resents Archie’s reﬂections on her childhood experience and indicate how important these principles became to her. Throughout “Notes on the Making of a Home” there is emphasis on spiritual aspects of life. “Element I: A Sense of the Lord” begins, “The child feels the Lord around and over all his life, like arms: a deﬁnite Person who is watching and hearing and caring . . .” “Element III: A Sense of Praise,” pro-vides for “a quick and trained recognition of blessings, and an immediate lifting of the h eart in praise to the Lord . . . a gath- ering together of accumulated and overﬂowing praises into festivals . . .” “Let’s have a festival!” became a motto of Sewall family life, handed down through the daughters to their children and grandchildren. Festivals might be religious feast days, but also national festivals, home anniversaries, birthdays and wedding days. Let them not be too many to lose signiﬁcance, and let th eir observ ance be h earty and continuous from morning till night . . .

The signiﬁcance of this experience is captured in “Element VII: A Sense of the Christian Y ear”: This is a subconscious following of the Lord through all the changes of the world and nature. It is a sense of resurrection in the spring, a sense of the productiveness of good life in the summer, a sense of the gradual gathering together “of all the world to be taxed” in the autumn, and when the days are shortest and darkest a sense of the Lord’s coming. The order of the home, of family prayers and hymns being based on this gospel progression, great and deep renewals are experienced every few months, and, by habit of the same recurring time, enter into the blood and bone of the child. . . .

As she expressed it: He was the most alive man I have ever seen . . . His liveliness was not only of physical energy, but a kind of beaming answer to everybody . . . His provision for his gifted little girls was to make sure to them that vibrating doctrine that “man truly lives for the ﬁrst time when he perceives that he lives from the Lord” [Emanuel Swedenborg, Secrets of Heaven , §2196]. From his own delight in such worship his thoughts were alive, his affections were alive, and so proliﬁc there seemed to be no way to stop their happy overﬂowing. 7 In this setting, it seemed to Archie in retrospect that learn- ing took place as a happy adventure. She continues: I remember taking from the bound music volumes near me on the piano seat a rather heavy book, and after opening it and playing a short movement, leaving it quickly to go with imperative announcement to interrupt my father writing under the Evangelists, “That must be a great composer, Mozart?” “Y es,” he said, and smiled—but not enough to reproach me . . . It seemed as if we were taught nothing. I do not think Maud (my nearest sister in age) was taught the piano at all, today a Dean of the American College of Organists and a recognized composer. I certainly had no more than a few months here and there. But we were set on the double Roman-designed (his own) piano bench beside him, or beside each other, before our feet could touch the pedals, to do what we could in the symphonies, Mozart, Hayden, Beethoven.

Bess’s daughters report that their grand-mother declared that she was too tired to make the youngest child practice, so their mother was the only sister who did not play an instrument. Archie suffered a similar lapse of memory in recalling her education, for most of her teachers were forgotten. A German governess, perhaps a woman from one of the n earby colonies of German immigrants to Ohio, presided over lessons for the Sewall girls. For schoolwork we children were set around the long table in the schoolroom looking out over the croquet lawn between the fruit trees, with the white plaster Psyche standing at the end of the paths on her Greek pedestal. With e yes often on these things we learned from our German governess reading, writing, and arithmetic, in German, with lovely fairy tales and bits of poetry The German we read was high German, but our talk was often interspersed with low German. 9 By the time Archie was ten, Frank Sewall had found it pos- sible to realize his dream of opening schools for younger chil- dren under the auspices of Urbana University. A kindergar-ten enrolled children from four to seven years old; a primary school offered instruction for boys and girls from eight to twelve; girls from twelve to eighteen were enrolled in the girl’s school, while boys attended a grammar school. From 1880 to 1883, Archie (called Alice or Allie at school) and Maud attended the primary school.

These delinquencies were tolerated under the doctrinal principles of Urbana University . . . Mr. Barler, like my father, thought spiritually, that is, from causes not facts. The fact of preserving our spiritual life while adapting us to the world was met by the knowledge that “one degree or form would not sufﬁce to give life to anything, much less give life to man.

For example, she lear ned, and utilized later in her own teaching, some elements of philoso-phy, such as the Swedenborgian concept of discrete degrees. In Swedenborgian thought, discrete degrees are parallel but separate planes of existence: the highest—the most heavenly, and therefore the closest to God—is the celestial; in the mid-dle, still in the spiritual realms but closer to our world, is the spiritual plane; and the lowest, the physical world around us, is called the natural plane. Swedenborg uses the illustration of the steps of a ladder to explain the relationship between these planes. From ear ly childhood Archie liked to draw. She recalls: “In the parlour . . . I began a series of Madonnas, in lead pencil, before I was ten, a complete picture with attendant angels, every Sunday afternoon in the big armchair by the front win-dow.” 11 Perhaps begun as a means of amusing herself on Sundays when everyday activities were proscribed, Archie’s early works featured the mother and child theme which was to absorb her throughout her life. No doubt her efforts were praised by her parents, who expected the children to share their pleasure in sketching. Each child was given a sketchbook to use on fam-ily outings. One of Archie’s nieces, Mary Schellenberg Poole, recalls hearing that her grandfather “was always stopping for ‘just ten minutes’ to make a sketch, often ﬁnishing it at home later. It seemed so natural to Mother, and she tried with not too much success to sketch and to teach us to do likewise . . ."

Archie was already attempting technical challenges: the wind blows curtains at the window of a house, a horse with braided mane lifts a prancing leg, young warriors slump in obvious dejection. Archie grew up in the midst of her father’s endeavors to build Urbana University into a distinctive Swedenborgian school that aimed to “bring the light of the New Dispensation down in the realm of nature and of science itself. It is not to teach theology and religion alone and apart, and science and philosophy alone and apart, but to unite the two hitherto sep-arated and irreconcilable factors into the sublime unity, order and beauty in which they stand revealed in light of the sci-ence of Correspondences 14 and of the spiritual sense of the Scriptures.”15 Frank Sewall tackled the difﬁcult problems of attracting New Church students to a school that had a checkered career, of building a well-qualiﬁed faculty with very little money, of raising money for both an endowment fund and operating expenses, and of organizing student societies and activities equal to the exuberance of his pupils, all the while insisting on excellence in every aspect of the school’s operation. This formidable task called on all of the energies and dedication of a young minister, especially one who had scholarly tenden-cies and high standards. As a child, Archie experienced those endeavors in terms of faculty and trustees who “sat in long conferences with long cigars. The College was a constant pres-ence.

Consciously we sensed adven-ture from the Lord.” 16 Frank Sewall’s tenure of sixteen years as president of Urbana University has the distinction of being the longest term a pres-ident has served that college. In time his differences with the trustees mounted to the point of his resignation. Many years later, Archie termed this a “defeat,” but all indications are that her father took the change in stride, perhaps having felt that he had done all he could against odds that were stacked against him. In Archie’s view, he had accomplished a great deal: Frank Sewall found it a good school waiting hesitant before its charter name. He left it a university with all the development in order from Kindergarten to the Bachelor of Arts degree, through girls’ school, boy’s grammar school, young ladies institute and college. He made it alive with the graceful appendages of the Minerva Literary Society, the Principia club, the Morris Natural History Society, even the “Latine,” his book of witty, charming and skillful Latin plays, many of which he wrote himself and published for the College’s permanent use. These clubs, including the Choral Society, with their regular public meetings and their contests, their frequent chamber concerts and oratorios and their cultural overﬂow combined with the style he gave everything he touched, made the University the real life of the town. The approach of a different spirit cut him off. He felt those in control were seeking an expedient for what we now call a realistic viewpoint, which generally means more fact and less truth. He announced the fulﬁllment of the $50,000 endowment which he had labored to gather. 17"

The childhood years in Urbana were but a prelude to the widening of her horizons when the family traveled in Europe. In 1886 the Sewall family left Urbana for Glasgow, Scotland, where Frank served as an interim pastor to the New Church society. Archie and Maud, then sixteen and fourteen, continued their education with their father, reading Cicero and Virgil in Latin and studying history, British philosophers, poets, and novelists. Archie was enrolled in the Glasgow School of Art, then headed by the dynamic and enlightened Francis (Fra) New-bery. At a time when many art schools admitted only male students, the Glasgow School of Art encouraged female stu-dents and opened to them all classes except for life drawing. “New” women were much in evidence among Glasgow artists by 1886, and it may be assumed that Archie absorbed some of their emancipated attitudes toward careers. At the conclusion of Frank Sewall’s Glasgow pastorate, he took his family to Germany and Italy for a year of travel. While traveling, the whole family sketched the picturesque scenes about them, and Archie studied and copied master-works of great classical artists in the museums. Wherever the family went, there was thoughtful preparation for what they would see. As a result they l earned history, literature, and lan-"

When the weather per-mitted, reading was enjoyed outside. Archie describes it: And the book always in hand—the one business of the day!

For Archie, the chief joy was the museums: the British Museum where she “met the Greeks”; Florence, where she “painted copies incessantly”; Rome, where she “came under the magniﬁcence of the serene Raphael, which to me has never been disturbed.” 4 She was responsive also to the beauty around her. For instance, describing Italy, she wrote: The intense individualism of every city and village, the beauty of line and its utter expressiveness.

It may have been only the captivation of the freely visible—the color and feel of parchment, of velvet silver-clasped bindings, the pink and gold of Fra Angelico over the doors, the marble slabs, hand-ﬁnished down to the bevel on the pavement—not an inch of it machine work—that taught us so kindly; the liberality of beauty on the street. 5 Music was absorbed with the other cultural riches, for Archie records: “We settled somewhere near the door of Wagner’s Bayreuth theatre for awhile and became engrossed in Parsifal and Siegfried. Maud taught us the dramatic motifs from the little parlour organ in our boarding house; and we practiced them walking through the meadow to the performance. Of course, in Dresden, the great orchestra met us again, the whole of the Nibelungen Ring; all the Beethoven symphonies poured out to us, sitting on the terrace above the river.” 6 Inevitably the children picked up signals that there was some- thing unusual about their family. As Maidy’s daughter recalls, “When walking in Europe they must have walked in a row for my mother overheard a stranger say, ‘One, two, three, four, ﬁve, six, seven’”—counting off the Sewalls as they went by. 7 Looking back, Archie comments, “In spite of the inevitable distinction of my handsome father . . . there may have been something, shall I say rural about us, unconﬁned?

The experience of appearing “different” must have reinforced the sense of family togetherness. Thus Archie, in her impressionable late teens, was intro- duced by her enthusiastic father to Scotland, England, Ger-many, Austria, Switzerland, and France. The family spent the winter of 1888–89 in Florence. Archie’s recollections of the experience concentrate on her father’s role to the exclusion of the part her mother must have played in arranging the details of daily life: We did not travel as well-to-do people, never very comfortably, but under the skill of an artist in life. Whatever became of the rest of the baggage the guitar traveled with us in the coaches, This gave us music at our journey’s end. No matter what our shelter—and knowing the sod of Italy, Germany, France, well from his student days, he led us down many by-paths—we, from our inner habitation, were always immediately at home as soon as we arrived: attentive and ready. Up went the sketches, and out came the little library, and a place was found for the Bible and the Psalm books. That inner dwelling which it was his mission to erect wherever he went in university, church societies, or in his daughters’ minds may be called “the large upper room furnished” which the Lord Jesus had commanded his disciples to ﬁnd for Him. He was continually “making it ready.” He knew the world well from his rich brilliant beginnings to the moment of his overthrow in Urbana, but no trace of bitterness against it was rehearsed to others, certainly not to his family. 9"

Somewhere between Pisa and Milan and on our way to Venice, we read the whole of Faust, both parts.

Knowing as I do from later observations, testimonies, and reading, what the basis was for the natural dread of the Latin Quarter in the minds of many good parents of gifted youths in that day, I can believe he did not want the pull of the great technique to set in upon me.

But, no doubt in answer to his prayers, I would yet receive the Beaux Arts training in another way. 11 As Archie described it, there was a “perpetual sunniness in which we went about the world,” even on rainy days that were “wonderful, more so if a little chilly, needing inventions—rugs, or sticks in the stove, etc.—for comfort.

Her young observer notes, “unlike most delicate people, she was very tolerant of their exuberance. Like my own mother, she was ill a great deal, but in spite of it they both kept a responsiveness that made them the center of their households, and the mainstay of their brilliant husbands.” 5 Mrs. Sewall’s whimsy comes through in the report that she made her own clothes, designed with long, ﬂowing sleeves, which the girls called “‘angel sleeves’ because she got the idea in church, suggested to her, she said, by the angels who were in charge of clothes. All of our activities were captained by them, according to Swedenborg, if we kept ourselves sensitive enough to obey and understand. When she had a peculiar dreamy expression during the sermon we knew that it meant a new dress, as she made them all herself.” 6 Archie and Maud were considered to be “almost in another generation, eighteen and nineteen, grown up young ladies.”7 Una especially admired Archie for the poetry she wrote, the songs she composed, her impromptu dancing while her father played the piano, and her romantic nature. “[She] used to play Chopin with the tears streaming down her cheeks, especially the Prelude with the dripping rain, composed while he sat heartsick and dying waiting for the faithless George Sand.” 8 Archie was an organizer who got up impromptu dramas and concerts involving the neighborhood youngsters as well as her own sisters.

I met him on the stairs going up to my studio. I invited him in proudly to show him my work. Before he left I was in tears, not of sorrow, but of joy, although he told me that everything I had done in color and in painting was wrong—that I was seeing without truth and delighting in it. My father who had thought everything I had done was right, submitted to my verdict to give up my studio and my career, and to go out to Georgetown to study with Mr. Helmick, who had intended taking no pupils, but he accepted me. I went out to him in Georgetown, receiving the drastic training of the Beaux Arts, pretty steadily for ten years. I began exhibiting, and painted many portraits, chieﬂy those of my father and of my mother. These were painted with the real knowledge Mr. Helmick had given me. 13 Imagine the scene when Archie rushed home to tell her parents that the eagerly awaited studio was to be abandoned, and that she wanted to study instead, to study with a teacher she had met by chance! Archie already had two years of training at the Glasgow School of Art; no doubt the whole family felt they had invested a lot in her career already, for her nieces heard tales from their mothers of the many occasions when Archie was excused from helping with household chores because of the demands of her painting or writing.

He seems to have been a demanding teacher. At one time, Archie told family friend Mary Paul Caldwell, he thought that she was not taking her studies seriously enough and lectured her severely on the importance of developing her talent. 14 In his opinion she needed to learn to really see, to see all the colors in the subject she was painting, to see the edges of objects. Helmick would sit in a student’s chair to critique the work on the easel before him. On one occasion he considered Archie’s drawing so deplorable that he painted a black X across it and stalked away, leaving Archie in tears. 15 But she persisted, and in a few years she was exhibiting her work. Helmick’s tutelage was effective, and Archie an apt pupil. By the time she was in her mid-twenties, she was participating in juried shows.

Archie had a studio in the Smith home in Georgetown for several years, and repaid them in portraits, two of the eldest daughter Cornelia and one of a younger daughter, Sarah. One of the portraits of Cornelia was accepted for the show at the Louvre. A family story indicates that the portrait of Sarah—a baby who looks as if she is about to crawl away from her seated pose—was rejected by the Louvre because the pose was considered unorthodox. John Zook, the grandson of Charles G. Smith Jr., reports that members of the Smith family also posed for a painting of The Holy Family , which Archie began in 1898 or 1899. It has been possible to locate a few other works done before 1900: a small oil of a sailmaker at work and oil portraits of her future husband’s family members—two John James’s sis-ters and his niece. A panel entitled The Musicians was exhibited at the Corcoran Gallery in 1897 and a painting of children in a grape arbor was given to a friend who was married in 1897. Seven stained glass windows were designed for the chancel of the Church of the Holy City, the Swedenborgian church under construction in Washington from 1894 to 1896. Archie also painted portraits of both of her parents in oils. Judging by the number of paintings we know about, which is not necessarily a complete list, Archie must have become a busy and productive artist by the time she was in her mid-twenties. By the time she was thirty, Archie was a published writer as well as an exhibiting artist. During the decade in Washington she published two books of poetry and a song cycle for which she wrote both words and music. Pastels in Song , published by John Clark of Cincinnati in 1892, consists of ten songs, mostly quite sentimental in vein. One song was dedicated to G. V . J.—Gertrude James (the sister of John James). Little Lyrics , Archie’s ﬁrst book of poetry, was privately printed in 1892 or 1893. A Christmas poem, “How Love Came,” was published in Harper’s"

I deny that of love there is ever a lack, I have felt His sun-arm across my back As I wandered at springtime into the land And talked with the Dogwood hand and hand. I am the spirit that denies Straight into your face, straight into your eyes Wise age, that for all your wisdom and gain Y ou are nobler for noticing every stain. I deny that one cannot race on through earth’s heat And come out healthy and clean and sweet."

During the Washington years the relationship between Archie and her father strengthened and deepened. Frank encouraged his talented daughter and often arranged for her public achievements. T aking advantage of the network of contacts he had through the church, classmates at Bowdoin, and friends and associates in Washington, Frank submitted Archie’s manuscripts to editors he knew, sent her paintings off to expositions, and handled correspondence about her work. Father and daughter were companions on trips also In Sep- tem ber 1893, Archie accompanied her father to the Columbian Exposition in Chicago, a world’s fair that cele brated the four hundredth anniversary of Columbus’s discovery of the New World. Adjunct to the fair was the Parliament of the World’s Religions, which had been suggested by a Chicago Swedenborgian, Charles C. Bonney. He proposed that an exposition of the “intellectual and moral” progress of human-kind was as important as the usual exhibition of “material triumphs, industrial achievements, and mechanical victories. ”17 The resulting World’s Congress Auxiliary, called to “bring about a real fraternity of nations, and unite the enlightened people of the whole earth in a general cooperation for the"

Frank Sewall took an enthusiastic part in the program, delivering an address on “The Character and Degree of the Inspiration of the Christian Scriptures” at the Parliament, and another on “One Lord, One Church, with its Successive Ages” at the denominational congress. Perhaps Archie’s mother did not feel well enough to accompany her husband to Chicago and sent Archie in her place; perhaps her parents had some special reason for wanting Archie to attend the exposition, or perhaps it was a birthday present. Like her father, she reveled in the pageantry and symbolism of the occasion and the dramatic overtones of such an imaginative enterprise as well as social contacts with international visitors. The occasion strengthened the father-daughter tie, as illustrated by Archie’s poem, “ Afterward”: These things are yours and mine forever more; The broad, white vision on the western plain . . . Of twined fruit and wings; of things that soar; Of lifted trumpets ’mid the lions’ roar; Of sinless colonnades without a stain Of anarchy, or words, or tears, or pain; Where beauty lies in sunshine at the door; Of those who walked therein and were our friends, T urbaned in love and clad in suns and moons,"

Scocia offered such thoughts as these: The spirit of the New Age which breathes everywhere, and which has produced such marvels in every branch of human activity, will exercise without doubt, a potent inﬂuence on the ﬁne and noble arts, inasmuch as that spirit comes from the spiritual world, and is according to the Divine promise to make all things new. The contemplation of the beautiful, elevating the mind from sensuous things, accustoms man to the preeminence and the dominion of truth over fact, of spirit over ﬂesh, and of things imperishable and eternal over mortal pleasures and interests. 21 A notable feature of the exposition was the participation of women, which extended to an address given to the assem- bled Parliament of the World’s Religions by a New Church woman, Lydia Fuller Dickinson, on “The Divine Basis of Co-operation between Men and Women.” She drew upon the Swedenborgian principle that men and women are created to complement each other in the sense that “each is an individ-ual, that is, each is both masculine and feminine in himself and herself; but in their relations to each other, man stands for and expresses truth in his form and activities, while woman stands for and expresses love.

She concludes, “A relation of marriage, or in other words, of mutual co-operation all the way through, in all the work of both, is the creative rela-tion between man and woman. It is the basic human rela-tion. Under a new impulse derived from woman herself, man is abdicating his external leadership, his external control over her. This he must do because his leadership and control in the past have expressed separation, and not union.” 23 The New Church women who addressed the denomi- national meetings were very much aware of the potential for changes in women’s position. Mrs. J. R. Hibbard, who addressed the assembly on “The T rue Relation of Woman’s Work to Man’s,” stated that there is “no lack of avenues for legitimate work for women. Medicine, the law, ﬁne arts, mechanics as applied to industries, all offer opportunities for the exercise of the especial form of woman’s mind, and if she be true to the God-given instinct of her being, she will not walk in the path of the man; but side by side they will be true help-meets the one to the other.” 24 As Mrs. T . F. Houts saw it, “In a state of true order each would ﬁnd his and her own place and work, with no conﬂict or thought of the superiority of the one above the other, and with no disposition to deﬁne and limit the sphere of the oth-er’s activities.” 25 Although the individuality and potential contributions of women were recognized, some speakers, including S. Seward (a woman), emphasized the role of woman as wife and mother: “How important that woman should realize the"

Barton presented a view grounded in Swedenborg’s writings: T aken alone, then, a man or a woman is but a fraction— the two halves must be considered together in order to present a unit . . . in separating the two, man and woman for the purpose of analysis, we have divided those whose very nature is indissoluble; for we may see that, in fact, something of love, the feminine principle, must enter into everything a man does, and even into his thoughts, because he cannot do anything, or think of anything, unless prompted by the will, and something of the understanding, the masculine principle, must be in every woman, or she would not know how to carry out her will. The essential difference between the two sexes is, that in man the understanding leads, but in woman this takes the second place. But there is no room for an arrogant assumption of superiority on the part of either man or woman; for, as Mrs. Browning says, “thought can never do the work of love.” Neither, we might add, can love be a substitute for thought, or either, by itself, bring anything to fruition. 27 There is no record of Archie’s reactions to these papers, but she must have been familiar with them, since her poem “ Afterward” was selected for a frontispiece in the book in which they are published.

Thus she could be expected to anticipate marriage as an opportunity to share her own nature and to develop her personal potential. Through a relationship with a man who needed what she had to give and would, in turn, complement it, they together would create a spiritual entity beyond what either could represent singly. As stated by the Reverend James Reed in a pamphlet with which Archie was probably familiar: “In man, as we see and know him, the intellectual, and in woman the affectional nature is more prominent. The two natures exist in each of them, but in different proportions and relations; so that, while each is com-plete in himself, by a true union, a larger man and a more per-fect angel.” 28 But in 1893, marriage was not yet imminent. Archie remained at home, the eldest daughter in a household of young ladies. The Sewall family led a busy and active life. T ogether and with friends and neighbors they made music, got up plays and puppet shows, went to museums, and enjoyed social occasions. Archie’s sister Rachel described their life at that time to fellow Swedenborgian Dan Nielsen: “We visited the art galleries and museums to study and write papers, to draw and sketch. At home we wrote poetry and joined in musicals in the afternoons and in the evenings. We were busy and worked hard.” 29 Nielsen adds, “She related that they lived in an artistic world, devoted to all the arts . . . writing poetry to each other; read-ing the great classics; visiting the art museums; contemplat-ing nature in all its forms. Very busy, she said. T wice Reverend Sewall engaged a canal boat and went up the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal for a two week trip, taking with him his whole family and their boy friends, and including a chef and maid. Philosophy, poetry, music, painting, sculpturing, disserta-tions—you name it, they indulged in it!” 30"

She told Agnes McGraw that she had been “introduced” to John when she was six months old,1 for the James family attended her father’s church; they were fellow Swedenborgians who lived a few blocks from the Sewalls. John and his sisters lived away from Urbana during part of their childhood, but after 1883, when John was fourteen and Archie was thirteen, the two were schoolmates at Urbana University schools. Archie’s special girlhood friend was John’s sister Gertrude (T rudie), three years older than she. According to Una Hunt, Archie had been in love with John since she was sixteen and became engaged to him when she went to visit T rudie, perhaps in 1891 or 1892. 2 The Sewall family story, as told by Elizabeth Blair,3 relates that “Drink to Me Only” was sung at a musical evening: Drink to me only with thine eyes and I will pledge with mine; Or leave a kiss within the cup and I’ll not ask for wine . . . After which John looked into Archie’s eyes and said, “Ditto.” Archie then told her sisters that she was engaged to be married.

John James’s grand-mother, Abigail Bailey James, was a daughter of Francis Bailey, one of the ﬁrst American Swedenborgians. John’s sis-ter Harriet Lynch James and her daughters were capable and enthusiastic musicians. The James household was well sup-plied with books, magazines, and newspapers, read and dis-cussed by the family. Every day began with the James family gathering for morning worship, as was also customary in the Sewall family. For Archie, Urbana represented a known local-ity, for she knew the town and its people. Y ears later, Archie told family friend Alice Memmott that she had been engaged for ten years. 6 If so, Archie’s visit to T rudie might have occurred in 1889, soon after the Sewalls returned from Europe. In 1889 Archie would have been nineteen and John twenty years old, not yet graduated from college and with law school ahead of him. Their parents would have considered them too young to marry, and perhaps John and Archie them-selves felt that they had an “understanding” but were not yet prepared to formalize it. Una Hunt’s account suggests that the engagement began a few years later, which seems more likely. 7 One can imagine a gathering of young people who had matured since they had last been together, enjoying the gaiety of a visit and the rediscovery of each other as young adults. Notes in Frank Sewall’s diary for December 23, 1896, record “Greet John Hough James, Archie’s ﬁnacé, on his arrival,” and on December 28, “reception to Mr. John H. James.” 8 This must have been the occasion when Archie’s engagement was announced, perhaps ﬁve or six years after the young couple reached an “understanding.” By 1896, John was three years out"

What happened during the seven years between 1889, when Archie and John reached their “understanding,” and 1896, when their engagement was formally announced? Archie, a talented young artist, serious about her painting and writing, widely traveled and highly cultured, must have come in contact with a variety of eligible and attractive men in the Washington circles in which her family moved. Did none of them test her loyalty to John James? A hint of romantic attachment is reported by her nephew, Frank Weller, who recalls that his mother told a tale of Archie’s friendship and correspondence with a Russian nobleman which “resulted in him being ban-ished to Siberia.” 9 If there was another romance, it was doubt- less before 1896, when John was “received” by the Sewall family, and might have developed while the Sewalls lived in Europe. Possibly it is memorialized in a cryptic poem, “The Broken Engagement,” found in Little Lyrics , a privately printed volume of Archie’s early poems. It reads: If you cannot see I cannot explain. Such things are not said, Only felt in pain. Y ou have loved me well Half a year you say! I will love you well Forever and a day. Are you silent, dear, From too much to say? Would you have me wait Till another day?"

The announcement of Archie’s engagement did not signal an imminent wedding. Indeed it seems possible that Archie rarely saw John during their engagement, for a letter from a friend in Scotland in April 1897 asks, “Will you see Mr. James this summer or will letters have to be all for a longer period? Please tell me if you are going to be married this year because I want you to have a little bit of my own work in your house.” 11 What might account for the delay? One explanation is that John’s commitment to the physical care of his ailing father was a factor. John Henry James was bedridden with “creeping paralysis” (perhaps multiple sclerosis) for the last years of his life, and required the services of his son as nurse and aide. John Henry’s death in 1898 would have released John III from that obligation—and propelled him into another, that of becoming the titular head of the family and the only living James male."

Archie, in telling of her long engagement, commented that it represented “ten years wasted.” Memmott understood her to mean that “the engage-ment was prolonged because Archie was so busy studying art that she simply put it off. After she was married she was sorry she hadn’t gotten married sooner. I had the impres-sion that it was her fault and she later regretted it.” 12 Perhaps Archie wanted to concentrate on her studies and her work. Another possibility is that the delay was due to reluctance to leave her family and it was Archie, not John, who felt duty-bound to follow through on the commitment. At the time of her marriage, Archie wrote a long poem entitled “The Bride’s Farewell,” expressing her feelings, perhaps ambivalence, about leaving her parental home, including these sentiments: Oh House of Feasts, farewell! oh golden home Set in a whirling globe of shining days . . . Come, let me tell you now our love and here Pay aching tribute to the unsaid things.

Her family experience, characterized by “resplendent gayeties” and “virtued jewels,” created such a rich dowry of memories and values that it is not surprising that Archie might have “paused in longing great” before leaving the family that nurtured, sup-ported, and inspired her. Assuming other potential mates, why did Archie choose John James? She might be expected to want a husband who was somewhat like her father, and indeed John resembled Frank Sewall in some ways, for he was a Swedenborgian, an intellectual, and a witty person who enlivened gatherings of people. He came from a family and a home that had a long tradition of valuing art, music, and literature. Perhaps Archie realized that this combination of qualities is rare. On the sur-face it may have seemed that John James would provide the ingredients for a life familiar to her and would be supportive of her accustomed lifestyle.

While some characteristics of the two men may have seemed similar, their styles contrasted sharply. John was named for his grandfather, Colonel John Hough James, dubbed a “Buckeye Titan” by his biographers, W . E. and Ophia D. Smith. 14 Colonel James, descended from a well- established Virginia family, came to Ohio in 1813 when his father, a merchant and river boat owner, settled in Cincinnati. John Hough James’s interest, however, was in the law and, admitted to the bar in 1825, he responded to an opportunity to take over a law practice in Urbana, the seat of Champaign County. There he built a house of his own design, inspired by the gracious homes of his native Virginia. Locally known as the “James Mansion,” the house was amply proportioned with The “James Mansion,” originally built by Colonel John Hough James in the late 1820s, was a ﬁxture in Urbana, Ohio."

John James’s law ofﬁce was located in the back wing of the house, over the kitchen, with a separate entrance from the street. The elder John Hough James married Abigail (Abby) Bailey, a native of Philadelphia and daughter of Francis Bailey, a printer who became interested in the works of Emanuel Swedenborg and was the ﬁrst to print and distribute them in the United States. Abby moved to Cincinnati in 1818 with her brother, mother, and sisters after her father’s death. John James was one of the young men who enjoyed parties and lit-erary evenings at the Bailey home. He and Abby were married in 1825. Their eldest daughter was born in Cincinnati; another daughter and two sons, one of whom died in infancy, were born in Urbana. Abby missed the amenities of Cincinnati and was lonesome in rural Urbana. Her husband’s solution was to invite her three unmarried sisters to come to live in Urbana. T ogether the four sisters created a gracious home in the thirty-room house designed by the colonel, planted trees and shrubbery, and laid out gardens to surround the mansion. Thus began the tradi-tion of an extended family living together at 300 High Street. Colonel James was an entrepreneur, quick to seize oppor- tunities and energetic about providing for the needs of the rapidly developing state of Ohio.

But he remained true to his principles and met all his obligations, continuing to ﬁnd business and political supporters in the state of Ohio and on the East Coast even though there were few in his own home of Champaign County. John Henry James was born in 1834, the youngest of the four children of John Hough and Abby James, and the only boy who lived to adulthood. He was sent to the Kentucky Military Institute and later became a captain in the 26th Ohio Volunteer Infantry during the Civil War. In early 1863 he returned home from the war, sick with typhoid fever and dys-entery. He recovered with the devoted nursing of his mother and sister, both of whom perished in the process of restoring him to health. After his recovery John Henry married Harriet (Hattie) Lynch of Brantford, Ontario, and brought his bride to the family home. John Henry and Hattie had seven children, six of whom lived to maturity. Their fourth child and eldest son was named after his grandfather, John Hough James. In 1872 or 1873, John Henry and Hattie took their family, which then numbered ﬁve children, to Sacramento, California, where Hattie’s family ran the local newspaper, the Sacramento Bee. A family story explains the trip as a search for a climate in which John Henry’s marginal health might improve. No doubt Hattie also wanted to see her parents and to have them know their grandchildren. Possibly the aging John Hough James found it increasingly difﬁcult to tolerate ﬁve growing children in the house and encouraged his son to seek another home. But California was not the answer. John Henry did not improve and baby Alexander died on the long train trip.

The upshot was that John Henry’s family went to live in a house on South Main Street in Urbana, and then settled in Marblehead, Ohio, where the colonel owned a large tract of land on the shores of Lake Erie. Limestone quarries were being developed in the Marblehead area in the 1870s and John Henry, continuing the family’s entrepreneurial tradition, leased some James land for quar-rying and built a dock from which stone could be shipped on Lake Erie. He seems to have lived the life of a country squire, engaging in business deals based on the lands acquired by his father. Apparently he and his family lived in Marblehead most of the time between about 1873 and 1884. T wo daughters were born there, Harriet in 1874 and Frances (Fanny) in 1877. The family may have then returned to Urbana, but lived again in Marblehead from 1882 to 1884, this time because the Urbana house was rented to Urbana University for a girl’s dormi-tory while the James family recouped from a disastrous busi-ness deal. The elder John Hough James died in 1881, and in 1884 the ownership of the Urbana mansion was established in the name of John Henry James when his only surviving sis-ter, Gertrude, and her husband Henry Niles signed a quitclaim deed that “effected a mutual partition of lands.” After 1884, the family of John Henry knew Urbana as home, although they continued to enjoy Marblehead as a summer home and the menfolk were often there to look after James interests in the quarry. In addition to ﬁghting for his health, John Henry must have found himself in the shadow of his energetic father, who played an active part in the expansion and maturation of Ohio as it developed from a frontier into an important Midwestern state. John Henry lived in an era of consolidation, of economic dips and surges, which offered different types of opportunity."

By that time years of poor health must have sapped his energies, and reverses must have discouraged him from innovation, even though his losses may have been a product of the times rather than personal ineptitude. John Henry died in 1898 after many years as an invalid. John Henry’s wife, Harriet Lynch James, is described by her granddaughter, Harriet Eaton Whitehead, as a witty, charm-ing, lively woman. 16 She was talented musically and sang in the Urbana Chorale organized by Frank Sewall. Musical abil-ity ran in the family; her eldest daughter, Abbe, taught piano at Urbana University before she married the Reverend Lewis F. Hite and went to live in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Abbe’s two youngest sisters studied piano and voice in Boston, and presented recitals after their return to Urbana. Margaret, the eldest James daughter remaining at home, became the manager of the house and gardens in Urbana, a role she played for the rest of her life. There are two sto-ries about why Margaret James did not marry. One is that she had a hysterectomy and thereafter thought of herself as ineli-gible for marriage. Another is that she recognized the symp-toms of impending crippling arthritis in T rudie and discour-aged a suitor because she knew she would be needed to care for her sister. Both of these stories may be true; and both sug-gest that “Minnie,” as Margaret was known in the family, chose the role of homemaker and nurse for the family, turning down opportunities to marry in the interests of remaining a James and safeguarding James traditions. John Hough James III grew up in a paradoxical position: the grandson of an entrepreneurial man, yet the son of a man who was not physically able to live up to the standards set by the elder generation. Named for his grandfather, John was no doubt expected to emulate him. Like his grandfather, he"

In the family tradition he served, although brieﬂy, on the Urbana City Council and became a trustee of Urbana University. He was thirty when his father died and he became the titular head of the James family. It had most likely been impressed upon him that he was expected to marry and to provide heirs for the family. John grew up in a household dominated by women: his mother, ﬁve sisters (three of them older) and, when the fam-ily lived in Urbana, his great-aunt Ellen Bailey. The same had been true for his father, who had three older sisters and three aunts in residence in addition to his mother. Both John Henry and his son must have learned how to cope with a variety of feminine temperaments, but p erhaps l earned less about asser- tiveness than men who grew up in environments that fostered conventional masculine strength. Frank and Thedia must have been familiar with this James family history, but Archie apparently did not feel that it posed potential problems. Perhaps in the spirit of her poem “Y outh,” Archie denied parental wisdom in her determination to “gather life’s reins with my soft wet palm.” 17 Whatever the rea- sons may have been for delay, the date for a June wedding was set in March 1899. A letter from Archie to John has been pre-served in the James family archives: My Dear John If you will meet me at the Church of the Holy City on 16th Street at high noon on the 14th day of June of this golden year of our Lord, I will be there and give you my hand in marriage, and my dear father will make me your true wife and you my own husband, and the great God up in heaven will make us one.

On April 25, the diary records his buying a print of the Sistine Madonna, the picture that had a prominent place in Archie’s early memories, for a wedding gift. The diary entry for May 10 reads, “Evening with Mama and A. A. and old duets.

She also designed the embroidery, to be worked by her mother, for her wedding dress. A week before the wedding, Frank Sewall’s diary records, “Return home from convention to ﬁnd Archie in bed lame from a cut accidentally received making it impossible for her to walk.” 19 The accident involved a chamber pot that broke beneath Archie, resulting in painful cuts. Preparations for the wedding went forward, with John and his sister T rudie arriv-ing on June 9. The wedding was held at noon on June 14, fol-lowed by a wedding breakfast at the Sewall home. Archie is said to have decorated a cane with which she walked down the aisle and, after the ceremony, to have thrown it aside and fallen into John’s arms, saying, “Now you can support me.” 20 But in the wedding photographs she looks a little dazed, due perhaps to the fact that she had not fully recovered from the accident. The list Archie kept of her wedding presents shows family contributions to her trousseau: a “traveling cloak etc.” from her mother, twelve handkerchiefs from Maud, a traveling bag from her father and a Kodak from Bess. Her father also provided a white silk wedding prayer book and a Bible. And from her sis-ters came treasures for her new home: a volume of Beethoven sonatas from fellow musician Maud and a brass tea kettle from Ray. T rudie James gave her a lace handkerchief, and “Mrs. James and the Misses James,” a gold chain. T rudie was one of Archie’s bridesmaids and the only mem- ber of the James family to accompany John to his wedding. There is no way to know whether this indicated that some of the James family felt negative about the marriage. John, following family custom, took his bride home to 300 High Street in Urbana.

Possibly John’s mother felt the need of a man in the household, although Margaret was a capable manager, thought by some to have more business acumen than her brother. According to Louise Orth, who would later become a student and a good friend of Archie’s, John’s grandmother is said to have expressed con-sternation at the notion that her son would live anywhere other than his “ancestral home,” 21 which suggests that she might have used her inﬂuence to perpetuate John’s presence in the house. There is no surviving account of how Archie, as John’s wife, was welcomed into her new home. A studio was prepared for her by combining several rooms over the kitchen, so her occu-pation as an artist must have been recognized and appreci-ated. It’s possible that Archie may have been treated more like another sister than accorded special status as John’s wife. Archie believed that it was wrong to so much as kiss before marriage, 22 but a poem she wrote as a Christmas gift to her father in 1898 suggests that she was ready in principle for marriage. “The Mother: An Ode” is “a gift to him who is the Beloved of her to whom I dedicate this song.” The lengthy ode contains imagery looking back on her mother’s experience and forward to her own: The trembling silver woof of virgin night That wrapped you Moon of Mystery—no more! Fallen the veil that tangled arms and limbs Till movement sprung in rapid infancy Ended in soft constrainment and delay. Thour’t given, Flower! Drop, petals, from t he hear t!

Archie had been accustomed to a family headed by a vivacious and energetic father who led his family in religious observances, in intellectual adventures, and in artistic pur-suits. She relied upon a gentle, supportive mother to smooth her way. She was accustomed to a leadership role in relation to her younger sisters, whom she often organized for dramas, clubs, and projects. Marriage meant leaving the familiar role of eldest sister and the daily reassurance of parental support. She not only had to make her way with John’s sisters as a new-comer to the household, but she had to accustom herself to a position junior to Margaret and T rudie, the resident sisters, who were older than she. Although John was now the titular head of the James fam- ily, his mother and sister Margaret seem to have determined how the household and family were managed. It is not clear whether John realized that Archie might expect to have a home of her own, for in his family the generations often lived together. Nor did John seem to assert himself on behalf of his wife when there was friction with his sisters.

Archie’s letter shows that she felt her change in status from daughter to wife: “Y our beautiful letter and its sad undertone made me happier than you thought it would. I felt as if I had grown up to be your friend as well as remaining your little girl. T o have your conﬁdence and especially in matters of pain is a new and beautiful bond, and an honor which my new station makes possible for me to appreciate. I wish you would always hold me in that regard and we will tell each other everything.” 1 Archie actually told her mother very little about her new life except what she might read between the lines of this paragraph: Oh I am learning so many things. The necessity for living synthetically—so hard to me who had such good training in analytical work of all kinds—and especially as I appreciate that the chief delights of every day are in the details. A woman is a most remarkable creature. And with more potencies under her hand than she ever uses. She seems to me to be giving all the time. When she is received or partially received she is so happy she thinks she is accepting gifts. But she is giving power. She in this stands so fully for the Church, and for the Ministry of Providence. Which gives ﬂowers to us when we never see them. 2"

T rue to her training, Archie gives a Swedenborgian twist to the les-sons she is learning. She identiﬁes herself as the church, using Swedenborg’s symbolism of the church as the earthly bride, receiving the love of the Divine from heaven. A wife or bride, therefore, connotes a spiritual state of receptivity to the love of the Divine. Thus she is in a position to transmit the “min-istry of Providence,” the caring and power of the Divine, who provides ﬂowers—symbolizing insights derived from faith—as they are needed. At a time in her life when she might have liked to feel cherished, Archie is sublimating her own wishes, assuming that she is doing the Lord’s work in her new status as a wife. But in living “synthetically,” trying to combine her Sewall values and standards with the approach to life of the James family, Archie no doubt missed daily sharing with her father in philosophical and literary analysis as they pondered the spiri-tual meanings of events and ideas. Perhaps she had taken for granted the intellectual exuberance with which Frank Sewall approached life, drawing family and friends along with him, and did not realize until after her marriage that it was a dis-tinctive Sewall phenomenon; one to be found under a differ-ent guise, if at all, in the James household. Archie was used to living in a household led by a dynamic man and his sup-portive wife, and companioned by her enthusiastic sisters; she had married into a family in which masculine leadership was offered hesitantly by her husband, accustomed to deferring to his mother and keeping peace with his individualistic sisters by humor and evasiveness.

But in the midst of his family, perhaps he, too, was forced into a “synthetic” mode, adjusting and adapting to their expectations and requirements as he had since boyhood, despite Archie’s attempts to empower him. Writing to her mother made Archie feel like a young daugh- ter again; her letter concludes: The family have gathered now on the front terrace for the quiet sunset time, and I must freshen my costume a little. I look very pretty for you. I have my white dress on and my blue ribbons. I so often feel when I look this way that I am still at home and followed by your eyes. Ray’s letter made me as vivid a drink of Coventry Hall 3 as if it had been of cider. I can see the long curtains blowing and smell the soft grass under the west windows. Y ou are walking there and how can it be that I am not there too! 4 From that note of homesickness, Archie turns to an attempt to reassure herself that her new status and location is all right: “This week is my birthday. We will all be very happy. We have so much to be grateful for. God bless you all. And me. Y our Archie.” After her marriage Archie continued to exhibit her work in Washington. In May 1900 she sent a decorative panel of angels to the annual show of the Society of Washington Artists. James Henry Moser, president of the Washington Water Color Club, reviewed the show for The W ashington Times and singled out Archie’s panel for comment, calling it “a La Farge-like and a most delightful thing. . . . News has arrived here that she has a picture in this year’s salon.” 5 That painting was the Portrait of Cornelia accepted for the prestigious Salon de Mai in Paris."

One sees too little work here with a new and individual color note in it, and these things are worth going a long way to see. The two studies in warm shadowy grays, subdued, but vibrating with a richness unknown to brightly colored pictures, are simply fascinating. The drawing and modeling is skillful and sincere. There is a note in the color that recalls Abbott Thayer, and something in the great simplicity of the technique as well, but the handling is not so vigorous. 6 In 1902, Cupid in Repose was awarded second prize at the annual exhibit of the Washington Water Color Club.

This picture is reminiscent of what is most glorious in art, all the way from Titian to Rembrandt and yet what a very modest unobtrusive little panel it is, one likely to be overlooked in this breezy collection of watercolors. 7 Moser continued to keep track of Archie’s work. In one of his columns he called attention to the fact that “ A charm- ing poem ‘On a Bright Morning’ by Mrs. Alice Archer Sewall James, whose little Cupid won the second Corcoran prize, occupies a full page with decorative border in the December Harpers.” 8 Later, anticipating a forthcoming exhibition of the work of Helmick’s pupils at the Veerhoff Galleries, he commented that the last showing “conclusively proved that the results obtained by his methods were among the very best obtained by any American teacher. Mrs. James and Mr. Senseny, both pupils of Mr. Helmick, have won places for themselves in the ﬁeld of art second to none achieved by any purely local painters and we claim them as Washington artists with no small degree of pride.” 9 Archie also exhibited in Cincinnati. T wo works were accepted for the T enth Annual Exhibition of American Art in 1903, a Cupid in pastels and an Eros. In 1904, at the Eleventh Annual Exhibition, she exhibited two portrait heads, includ-ing her Portrait of a French Gentleman , Frederick P . Collette, pro- fessor of Romance languages at Urbana University. Archie described it to family friend Josie Hatt as depicting “a ﬁne French gentleman of high culture, of the best bourgeois type which, combined with his delightful reﬁnement, makes a charming head.” 10"

James Moser wrote of the latter: “ A reli- gious picture, A Holy Family , by Alice Archer Sewall James is one of the very important pictures shown. It is so new, origi-nal and beautiful in composition, color and sentiment that it is difﬁcult to determine its place. Mrs. James, in this picture, steps up into the class with Abbott, Thayer, Brush and Loeb; still how unlike any of them it is. It seems, indeed, to go far-ther back . . . to Raphael himself, for its inspiration.” 11 The Holy Family received other critical acclaim. It was one of three Copley prints reproduced on the front page of the New Y ork Herald Arts Supplement of December 12, 1909, chosen to illustrate an article about “The Christmas Story in American Art” by Gardner T eall. Lamenting that too few American painters attempted religious subjects, T eall wrote: “T oo often for the majestic ideal of womanhood we have merely inane prettiness in paintings of the Virgin and Child but in . . . Fuller’s Madonna we have sweet and beautiful maternity por- trayed, just as we ﬁnd it, too, in The Holy Family by Alice Archer Sewall James, an Ohio artist. Indeed, in these two pictures American art again claims a distinction of its own, exhibiting, as they do, certain characteristics peculiar to the better work of our foremost artists.” 12 The St. Louis Exposition of 1904 was regarded as a spe- cial opportunity for artists. As James Moser explained: “Every painter with any ambition, faith, or pride in his ability should spare no effort to be represented. From the strict and exact-ing character of the jury work, it is evidently to be a mark of no little distinction to have been even an exhibitor at St. Louis this year and medals and mentions should carry with them special signiﬁcance and honor.” 13 Archie responded to this opportunity and worked hard in the winter of 1903–4, preparing two paintings to send to St. Louis: Cupid’s T emptation and Return of the W arrior .

A collection of short poems entitled “The County Fair” was published in Harper’s Weekly in October 1902. By 1904 Archie had also completed a book of plays, which was submitted to several publishers. One of these was The Lady Joanna: A Mask [sic] for Christmas Eve . A surviving handwritten copy, prepared as a Christmas present for her sisters Rachel and Bess, is illus-trated in watercolors by Archie. This and several other plays that survive as handwritten manuscripts are tales of dukes and princesses, of loves fulﬁlled and unrequited, of disguises and daring deeds. 14 They are fairy tales, sometimes with musical accompaniment written by Archie’s sister Maud. Possibly they were originally performed for family and friends as part of the festivals enjoyed by the Sewall family. In general, the plots are thin and characterizations slight, but some passages have an almost Shakespearean verve, such as a speech of Blueberry the Fool to the Nurse in The Duke’s Messenger: “Thou art a proud- stomached thing to lay rules for the sun. And thy deductions and thy securities are a sore in my brain. The sun cannot lie him down in the west but thou hast his rising planned, and guest about with thy candles dragging the stars to their duty, and shufﬂing the moon from her pretty bed . . .” 15 The ﬁrst ﬁve years after Archie’s marriage were a produc- tive period, during which she worked hard and successfully, earning a reputation as a ﬁrst-rate, innovative artist, capable of envisioning and executing paintings enjoyed by others and appreciated by critics. Her writing met with less public suc-cess, but that did not stop her from undertaking projects such as an ambitious play about Scotsman James Crichton and The W anderings of Eros , an epic poem about love. Archie had time and opportunity as well as the inclination to lead a creative life as the artist in the James family."

      "text": "68 Stay by Me, RosesThe theme of Eros/Cupid, the god of love, appealed to Archie. Her treatments of it perhaps represent attempts to cope with her own experiences. Her student Bob Nicol explains, “T o her the classic Greek culture represented the Ancient Church . . . an elaborate system of correspondences and totally monotheistic, the various gods, goddesses, and minor deities being aspects of the Divine. So you can see that this idea went far beyond the traditional English reverence for the classical culture to the point where it had a living mean-ing expressing the deepest spiritual truths . . . [her] own use of the Classics in her painting was not just an exploitation of mythology as devices for pictorial effect.” 16 As a Swedenborgian, Archie was used to thinking in terms of “correspondences,” an interlocking system of meanings in which objects or ideas exist on several different planes—our physical world; above that, the unseen realm of spirits where we go after death; and above that, the heavens. Each plane is a coherent system which represents and makes accessible the others. Thus Eros/Cupid symbolizes the forces of love and desire that enmesh men and women in our physical world, but on a higher plane, it is also that which intertwines with a loving, outreaching God who y earns for t he fulﬁllment of the personal potential of individual humans. In the 1902 painting Cupid in Repose, Cupid is a static ﬁgure, holding still, as it were, long enough for careful scrutiny and study, to allow both artist and observer to feel into his nature. By 1903, Archie had decided to develop the Eros theme in poetry and undertook to write an epic, The W anderings of Eros . In 1904, her newly ﬁnished painting Cupid’s T emptation was described in the Urbana Daily Citizen as depicting “a beautiful young girl tempting Love for a kiss, with an apple which she holds in her hand. Cupid is hesitating, and his undecided state of mind is clearly visible in his face. However, it seems clear to the gazer that beauty will gain love.” 17"

In the “proem” to The W anderings of Eros she explains her concern with “Love entire, Divine and dire” and anticipates “death and pain and care” in the “intert hreaded harmonies [that] blend philos- ophy with ﬁre, Nature with soul.” Archie’s version of the epic recasts Eros as the son of the Earth goddess Demeter rat her than the traditional Aphrodite, thus permitting the more maternal goddess to prepare her newly earth-ar rived son for life among mortals by removing his godly glow as he lies sleeping in a glade. Aside from that change, the epic retells the familiar mythic scenario in which Psyche experiences a mystic bond with Eros, the god of love, and leaves home for the palace that is invis-ible to her sisters, content with the lover she cannot see until they provide her with lamp, sword, and incentive with which to trap him. W anderings also depicts the human soul coming to recognize its divine companion, at ﬁrst dimly with occasional experiences of fulﬁllment; then, trying to understand love in limited human terms, only to lose trust and destroy the bond, later regained through plumbing the depths of experience. In a letter written to a friend in June 1903, Archie describes her circumstances at the beginning of work on W anderings : “I have a very little to add from myself. My life has no chil-dren in it and scarcely any household interests, and the lonely atmosphere of art is not good material for sociability. I have been working hard, painting mostly portraits . . . I am writing, too, not so steadily, little unforeseen poems, and one long sus-tained epic in many cantos about Love. I am happier every day and very well.” 18 Archie had time for a major sustained undertaking in days ﬁlled mainly with writing and painting.

From her Swedenborgian perspective she recognized that personal development involves a process of “regeneration,” an ebb and ﬂow involving both intellect and emotion as the individual makes choices which conﬁrm or test a loving bond with the Divine. Envisioning her own experiences by working them through in paint and words would enable her to gain perspec-tive, to work out the meaning of life. Perhaps she felt “happier every day,” but more likely she, like Psyche, felt “lone, com-panioned not at all” and knew from her own experience the feelings she attributed to Psyche: “Life is a thorny wilderness,” she mused, “needing a woman’s courage. I will heal it. Life is a labor and a sacriﬁce. I will endure and bear. I will accept hard-ship, and give the riches of my youth to save the world. Some day the Good will come. I will believe it.” 19 We can imagine some of the thorns in Archie’s “wilderness”: no children, no “household interests,” limited sociability, no home of her own, sharing her husband with his mother and sisters, feeling stranded away from the sources of inspiration represented by her family. Y et she, like Psyche, appeared will-ing to “accept hardship,” to “endure and bear,” for she consid-ered it to be the stuff of life.

The date of these events is not known, but must have been well before the fall of 1903, for by then Archie had written a story about a man who failed. The story has not been located, but the letter from the editor at Harper’s to whom Frank Sewall sent the story gives a sense of its contents: October 23, 1903 Dear Mr. Sewall: I have read your daughter’s story of a young man who failed. The touch is poetic and every line ﬁne and delicate. It is deeply and impressively poetic. I wish that it were a happier kind of story that I could take for the Magazine. Not that I think that stories in a Magazine must all have a happy issue. The majority of stories must be unhappy—if they are true. The difﬁculty here is that the reader’s pain does not seem to be quite justiﬁed. There is a too steady descent into shadows, and the general effect is depressing. I am therefore obliged to return it to you. But I cannot do so without saying that the sadness which has come into your daughter’s life troubles me. I had wished always the best for her. But who knows what is “best?” Perhaps this may be. I cannot help hoping for a happy issue of this life story. With hearty sympathy, Y ours sincerely, H.M. Alden 21 From Alden’s letter, it seems clear that Archie’s story was inspired by her husband’s experience—his failure as a lawyer and perhaps other defeats that he had suffered. Archie’s way of dealing with her feelings about the string of events was to write a story, to objectify and ﬁctionalize what had happened."

In the spring of 1903 he had the measles. The following winter he suffered from heart problems. As spring 1904 approached he had a case of blood poisoning and problems with his eyes; just as he seemed to be recovering, he came down with the grippe. At times a nurse was hired to supplement Archie’s efforts to care for him. Meanwhile, Archie continued with her work, revising The Holy Family and preparing to send two paintings to the Lou- isiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis. T oward the end of her preparations for the St. Louis Exposition, she wrote to her father, “I am getting awfully tired of the rush and anxiety, and shall never paint for an exhibition again. I have certainly laid up enough pictures ahead to draw on for awhile, and shall paint in peace hereafter.” 22 By early March 1904 the paintings were completed and friends were invited to view them before they were sent off to the exhibition, which opened April 30. Archie had ﬁnished her winter’s work, and wrote to her family about her teacher’s response to The Holy Family: “Mr. Helmick said that after I had reduced some half-tones in one little place or two, it would be the ﬁnest American painting he had seen. He seems to feel that everything is before me, and tells me to price it at $1000 and wait till I get it. (!) Also to have it copyrighted and repro-duced in Copley prints.” 23 In the same letter, the strain of John’s problems and ill- nesses shows as Archie recounts Easter morning, the day before: “Y esterday when John ﬁrst stood up in his wedding clothes so brushed and clean and ﬁne I burst into the most unreasonable crying. It seemed as if he had been restored to me out of a dark silence. How grateful and happy I am for this blessing.”"

The Sewall family, for whom the motto “all you have to do is try” led to accomplishments, prescribed a fresh start for John, away from his family home and the fail-ures in Urbana. Frank Sewall tried to help, suggesting that John might teach law and enlisting the aid of his brother-in-law, James Gilchrist, in contacting law schools on John’s behalf. Ill though he was, John wrote to follow up on the leads pro- vided by Archie’s Uncle Jimmy. He sent a copy of one of his letters of application to Mr. Sewall. It begins as follows: Urbana, Ohio April 20, 1904 Hon. George Edwin MacLean, LLD Pres. State Univ. Of Iowa Dear Sir: T wo or three months ago in answer to a letter of inquiry from me, Dean Gregory informed me that there exist no vacancies in the law faculty, but that he had placed my letter on ﬁle that I might be borne in mind should a vacancy occur later. I shall be glad to make application for a position, should one offer, provided the branches to be taught are those in which I feel myself qualiﬁed to take up the work of an Instructor. I have had no experience in teaching the law. I received my A.B. degree here at Urbana, and my L.L.B. at the University of Michigan in 1893. I am thirty four years of age and for the past ten years have been in the practice at this place. My desire is to teach some branches of the law other than the law of Crimes, Corporations, Common Law Pleading, Insurance, Bankruptcy, Federal Procedure, etc., my preference being for subjects such as Contracts, Agency, Partnership, Bills"

Should I be so fortunate as to secure a position as instructor in your law faculty, or in some other law school, I intend, on receiving appointment, to devote my time to the work of special preparation from the standpoint of a teacher in the subjects to be taught. 24 Archie was eager for a new beginning, even if it meant liv ing in reduced circumstances. She wrote to her family, “Indianap- olis College of Law writes that they want to know the smallest amount John would accept. And I am trying to make him set it very small. We could get along on almost anything for one year and live in two rooms, so that only he may have the start, the ﬁrst step taken. But I am afraid this discussing of plans is only tiring to darling Mama who has had so much of it, bless her heart. So I will refrain.” 25 But teaching law was not the solution for John. Indeed, it is questionable whether he wanted to pursue this option, for it is hard to imagine that someone truly eager for a job would write as he did, emphasizing his lack of experience and preparation, and stressing what he cannot teach before stating the subjects in which he feels qualiﬁed. We are left with the impression that John felt obliged to explore the notion of teaching but sabotaged his chances so that he could stay in Urbana. Why was it important for John to stay in Urbana, tethered to his family home? There must have been forces at work in his life, perhaps subconscious, which made the setting of 300 High Street seem right and proper to him. His mother con-sidered the James “mansion” to be their “ancestral home” and could not imagine her son living elsewhere. 26 Perhaps she had emphasized to her son that he belonged there and, as the last male in the line, was the only one who could carry on the James tradition. John may have felt that he had a responsibil-ity he could not ignore to care for his mother and unmarried sisters."

By 1905 Archie had learned well the lesson of being grateful for small attentions, such as her husband coming to meet her, even though the purpose of his expedition was to warn her of all the complications she was about to encounter at home. John is of course dreadfully worried about the situation for the family, but most for me, and packed me off to see Dr. Ring this morning. I was glad to go as my back had been in a continual contraction ever since I came and was sore as a boil.

Archie attributed her deteriorated nervous condition to the circumstances in Urbana. In a letter to her father a few weeks later, she reported: I think I am better nervously than I was in Washington but I can’t seem to get my strength back. I don’t worry at all about what Dr. Ring said for I think I shall beat his record owing to the osteopathy I have had. But ever since I came home I have had pain in my back and am still unable to walk but a few squares. I think it is due to the great shock and strain of the condition of the family on my arrival. Y ou can have no idea of what it was, or of how I suffered from it at the time. I also ﬁnd it hard of course to counteract the extreme depression and sick atmosphere of the house. Coming from a very healthy bright household it seems almost impossible. 3 No doubt it was upsetting to Archie to experience so vividly the contrast between the “healthy, bright” Sewall family and the James household where, much of the time, one or more people were ailing. Even though Archie’s mother was diabetic and less energetic than the rest of her family, her outlook was lively and positive and caring, in no way detracting from the vitality of the rest of the family. In contrast, members of the James family suffered from debilitating ailments which lasted for years, requiring care from the healthy people, not to men-tion patience with their discouragement at feeling poorly. Archie followed Dr. Ring’s advice to “take absolutely no responsibilities” for three months, to “let things go hang and walk in the woods and pick daisies.” She wrote to her father, “I am absolutely quiet and outdoors all the time and can see that I gain all the time.” And to reassure everyone, she added: “T ell"

The garden is heavenly.”4 But sometimes the days dragged by and thirty-ﬁve-year-old Archie felt less optimistic and longed for letters from her fam-ily. She wrote to her mother, “John is away in Marblehead and the days seem interminable without him, especially now that I have broken my glasses and have to wait four days for them. For that reason I oughtn’t to be writing now and can’t write any more, but I did want to speak to you so. Do you think that by next spring John and I will be housekeeping, and can you and Papa come to Convention and ministers meeting in Urbana and bless the house and name it for us?” 5 Four months passed, and still Archie had not recovered. Finally T rudie decided to take matters into her own hands and planned to take Archie away for a change, to the James home in Marblehead on the shores of Lake Erie. Secretly, she invited Archie’s sister Rachel to join them. When Archie found out about the plan, she wrote to her mother, “Please please let Ray come. I simply need one of my own family. It will make me well.” 6 The three women stayed in Marblehead late into the fall of 1905. From there Archie wrote to her parents on their wed-ding anniversary, describing her convalescence: “Before me is a long day of lying on the porch, breathing and watching the great spaces of sky and sea crossed at long intervals by pictur-esque and touching bits of humanity, the Polock children bear-ing their loads of fagots gathered in the woods against the winter, and at night, it is at half past ﬁve when I give up the long, low sunset and come in to our roaring little stove and Ray’s sparkling lamp and smile it seems like such an awfully short day.” 7 The trio returned to Urbana, and Rachel stayed on until early January 1906.

The period is sparsely documented, but surviving letters to her family in 1906 indicate that Archie experienced a series of ups and downs. In early March 1906 she wrote to her father, “I am really started on the right road now,” as she recounts spending less time in bed and going into the parlor to play a hymn on the piano. 9 But apparently the right road was short, for a month later she wrote: I have had two excellent nights sleep and yesterday morning decided to make some decided step so went down to the Rings and took lunch with them. They were very sweet. After I left them I walked a little way past the college. This morning I have walked in the garden and have interviewed the Easter rabbit skipping among the newly-sprung hyacinths about his Easter eggs. I feel a new spring of health in me and am on the right road again. My set back was very serious while it lasted and alarmed me considerably, and I still have much pain in my head . . . but now that I am better I shan’t be so alarmed if I should have another set back. 10 Understanding Archie’s life requires an explanation for why a healthy, energetic, positive-minded Sewall was downed by nervous prostration. How was it possible that a produc-tive artist, determined and disciplined in he r work, earn- ing recognition from juries of prestigious exhibitions, could be felled by a condition brought on by a “nervous” mind-set?

Although she went to Washington, where she could be sur-rounded by the healing positive atmosphere of her own fam-ily, that did not save Archie from a downward spiral in men-tal and physical health. “Nervous prostration” was a common female ailment at the turn of the twentieth century, a debilitating malaise charac-terized by lack of energy and assorted aches and pains that seemed to defy cure. This nervous exhaustion was recognized as stemming from mental angst as well as from physical causes. In 1902, Dr. Emma F. Angell Drake described the sufferers: “Women are simply tired nervously, they have lost their bear-ings and do not know where to ﬁnd them again . . . Life has lost its sweetness and they are heartsick.” 11 In 1910 Charlotte Perkins Gilman, in her article “The Ner- vous Breakdown of Women,” explained its etiology in more detail: Full nervous serenity depends on the smooth adjustment of the two interacting parts of every living thing—the body and the spirit. The creature must be satisﬁed with itself; it must do what it likes to do, and like to do what it does . . . No (one) can maintain that equipoise of soul and body unless . . . the individual is consciously convinced that the work he is doing is necessary and right. If that fact is cl early established, fully accepted, then the nerve force which would otherwise demand different expression is used to keep the machine steady, to hold the nose ﬁrmly to the supposedly necessary and beneﬁcial grindstone. Let it once enter the mind which is behind the nose that grindstones are NOT necessary—much less beneﬁcial—and the position becomes irksome . . . If the individual no longer contentedly accepts his “lot”—or hers—the effect on the nervous system is disastrous. 12"

Archie tried to reas-sure herself as well as her family that everything was all right. But it wasn’t. She had nursed John back to health and tried to interest him a job away from Urbana, only to ﬁnd that he set-tled for work that would keep them living in the family home-stead. It seems likely that the circumstance that made the sit-uation intolerable for Archie was John’s decision to work for the newspaper. She had put a lot of energy into trying to get him to leave Urbana and probably had pictured to herself how their lives would then change for the better. The “grindstone” of living with her in-laws was not necessary in Archie’s view, and she could no longer “accept her lot.” Both Dr. Drake and Charlotte Gilman describe nervous prostration from a woman’s perspective. A somewhat differ- ent view is propounded by Dr. Abraham Myerson in his 1920 book The Nervous Housewife, in which he discusses nervous reac- tions from a perspective that might be similar to that of John James and perhaps his family also. Myerson thought that his patients had excessive fears and worries and tended to “mag-nify the pins and pricks of life into calamities.” Little things that they might have been expected to take in stride pro-moted “worry over the life situation in general . . . [over] the health and prosperity of the household. Such worries accumu-lated, resulting in “de-energizing emotions and experiences . . . things that suddenly rob the victim of strength and purpose.” Myerson lists some of the speciﬁc circumstances that contrib-uted to the nervous reactions of his patients: “hope deferred, disappointment, frustration of desire or purpose . . . unhappy life situation (including mistaken marriage) . . . failure of inter-est in one’s work.” 13 Marriage may be a breeding ground for such circumstances, and doubtless it was so for Archie.

Matters that seemed irksome or disastrous from Archie’s Sewall perspective may have been regarded as “pins and pricks of life” by John and his family. The complex process by which a couple ﬁnds its own way, mixing components from each of their families, is even more complicated when they live with one of those families, for then there is constant reinforcement of the perspective of one partner and an ever-present expectation that the “out-sider” will accept and adapt to everyday habits and assump-tions so familiar that the “insiders” take them for granted, unaware that things might be done differently. Dr. Myerson would have found that Archie’s case illustrated well his experience with nervous conditions of women. The deferred hope that Archie wrote about in letters to her fam-ily was the desire that she and John “go to housekeeping” in a home of their own. She had had enough of a household orga-nized by John’s mother and sisters, and wanted a place—even a small one—where she could do things her way. Doubtless Archie felt that she could be a more positive force for John’s health and career if she could direct and determine his daily regimen. She wanted power as a wife so that she could “give power,” as she had writte n to her mot her in the early days of her marriage, believing that she might then be able to support and encourage John so that he could play his proper role as husband and breadwinner. In Dr. Myerson’s opinion, a woman’s nervous symptoms often served as a “weapon against the husband,” expressing what he called an unconscious “will to power through weak-ness.” Apparently Myerson did not recognize that a woman might have a right to defend herself against the custom of the times that often permitted a husband to decide where the family would live, thus depriving his wife of a say in the matter.

It is pos-sible that Archie, desperate for a home of her own, had tried all the stratagems she could devise to bring about the desired result and used up her strength, as it were, leaving weakness as the only tool at her command. Y ears later, in describing her illness to a friend whose wife had a nervous breakdown, Archie remarked that the younger woman would be able to recover more quickly because “she has you so close and all her own.” 14 John had to be shared with his mother and sisters and was not available for the close-ness Archie expected. One way to claim his attention was to need his strength and solicitude. But that was difﬁcult to bring about if she was performing more capably than he. Archie’s surviving letters do not mention disappointment in having no children, but she surely felt it. Apparently she was never pregnant. Again and again she painted portraits of mothers with children, a theme much on her mind but not fulﬁlled for her personally. As some observers described the James family, Archie could be forgiven or permitted anything except not producing an heir for the James family. This “frus-tration of desire and purpose” no doubt affected everyone in the household. Possibly it was not verbalized but, if unspoken, the desire for an heir might have become all the more potent a force in family dynamics. Perhaps Archie could have coped with the problems of having no home of her own and no children without resort-ing to illness. But what Dr. Myerson calls “failure of interest” in work goes right to the h eart of Archie’s dilemma. She had exercised her role as the family artist brilliantly, producing the “ﬁnest American painting” her demanding teacher had seen. As Howard Helmick said, everything lay before her.

Living at home until she was twenty-eight, Archie forged strong bonds of dependency on her father. Frank Sewall was her tutor and mentor in art, music, litera-ture, and philosophy. As an intellectual and a minister, he was her arbiter of what was good and true, an able exponent of the right way to do things.

But being deprived of the kind of relationship she had antici-pated and, in addition, being expected to adjust to living with the James family must have forced her to become even more appreciative of Sewall family ways and attitudes. At the time of Archie’s illness, programs for recovery from nervous prostration reﬂected an understanding of the need to create a healthy regimen for both the spirit and the body. Dr. Drake recommended reading the Bible for an hour a day in order to ﬁnd “sources of peace and strength outside your own mind”; auto-suggestion to “establish a habit of looking on the bright side of things and . . . keep the mind pre-eminent over the body”; exercise, especially walking, to be done “with a determined purpose of enjoyment as well as for health”; and “as exercise for the soul, communion with the Maker.” 15 Dr. Drake was not alone in recommending a program that could amount to a comprehensive r earrangeme nt of a wom- an’s daily life and mental orientation. Ellen H. Richards, in an early twentieth-century lecture on The Art of Right Living at the Summer School of the South in Knoxville, T ennessee, advo-cated adding other elements to maintain health and serenity: proper nutrition; sleep, in order to “recreate power and force”; play, and laughter; work that promotes a sense of effectiveness and “feeling of conscious power over things” and a “philoso-phy of pleasure . . . a purpose so dear to the individual as to sweeten toil and minimize sacriﬁce.” 16 Recovery of her energy was Archie’s primary task in 1906, but apparently neither Archie nor Dr. Ring knew about the prescriptions for recovery advocated by Dr. Drake and Mrs. Richards. Archie was instructed to rest and do nothing, and she made very slow progress during the fall of 1905 and win-ter of 1906."

She set goals for herself, gradually increasing the length of her daily walk. First out to the garden, then down the driveway until she was able to negotiate its entire length; then half a block to the corner, around the block, and so on, until at last she could walk a mile. In time she began to carry things, progressing from a light bag to a heavy satchel, and eventually to a loaded knap-sack on her back. Her husband apparently recognized Archie’s need to get away from the James home, for he arranged for her to visit in the country, spending periods of days and even weeks at farm homes. One such visit was cut short because Archie felt that one of the women in the household was infusing a “subtle poi-son” into the atmosphere. Although she enjoyed the other people, Archie wrote to her parents, “I long to be asked to visit there sometime when she is absent. As it was, I couldn’t stand it and couldn’t evade or ignore it, and called John on the telephone to come to get me.” 18 A visit to another farm worked out better. Frank Sewall joined his daughter there and the two had a happy time walk-ing in the countryside, selecting and naming special vistas, reading, and talking. Writing to her father the day after his departure, Archie recalled the pleasures of his visit: I drove home slowly, in fact Maud took her own gait, and it was none too slow for me where every step of the winding road was so freshly impressed with your presence and your words, almost your voice.

She recounts that the day after he left, “I rose feeling in myself that certain half-recognized clouds in my own mind and heart had vanished since your visit, and I knew myself sounder and happier than I had been before. My head was clear and I felt refreshed and strong.” 21"

Her let-ter begins: Enlarge the place of thy tent, And let them stretch forth the curtains of their habitation; Spare not; lengthen thy cords, And strengthen thy stakes. Darling Papa and Mama, I read that this morning in my full choral service in the midst of the shining ﬁelds under the shadow of Vox Pacis. Such a beautiful Whit Sunday, sparkling white and gold and fragrant with the ﬁrst roses. 22 Archie’s letter recounts long walks in the countryside, now up to two-and-a-half miles, enjoying the people she met along the way. John came to visit from time to time, but thought it best for her to stay on longer at the farm. Judging from the surviving family letters, Archie regained her strength by rest and exercise and visiting in the country away from the James home. The highlight of the period was her father’s visit, which apparently lasted for a week or more and made it possible to live in the cherished Sewall mode, reading and walking, enjoying the countryside and cement-ing the father-daughter bond. Although Archie could not have John “all to herself,” she did have her father’s sole attention during his visit, and t he experie nce heartened her. By August 1906 Archie was well enough to join her mother Thedia and sister Maud at a resort in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania.

Archie played a Haydn symphony with me—our old ‘jumbo’ symphony—just before dinner, and sur-prised and delighted me with the splendid spirit and accuracy with which she played.” 23 And Thedia reported to Frank: Archie is really much nearer well than she realizes . . . Y ou may see how much better she is by hearing that last evening she made the hit of the evening in a costume masque—a crazy kind of an affair—and she could not bear to be out of it. So with our shawls and feathers from our hats—and a liberal use of our paint box—she appeared on the stair as a chief of the “Miscreants”—She was great—people were fairly hushed for a moment—it was a good thing for her to be able to do and she was very proud of her success. 24 By December 1906, Archie was calling on friends and neigh- bors, practicing the piano every day, and enjoying preparations for Christmas. The series of letters which have been preserved stops right after Christmas, and with it the details of Archie’s recovery. Apparently she continued to have some relapses, although their nature and timing is unknown. Archie’s energy had improved, but the basic problems that had contributed to her illness remained. She and John still lived at the James home. They had no children. If she began to paint again, and did it according to her standards, she would still risk outperforming John. And she still felt a need for sup-port from her parents."

In 1908 or early 1909, during a visit to her sister Maidy in Washington, DC, Archie painted an oil portrait of her four-year-old nephew, Frank Weller. The portrait received critical acclaim and a picture of it was featured in the newspaper. By December 1909 Frank Sewall referred to Archie as “now happily recovered from a lingering illness.” 2 Another for- ward step took place in 1908 or 1909: Archie and John took an apartment at “Cherry Flats,” a block away from the James family home. Was the move made because John accepted Archie’s need for a home of her own? Or because the Tribune had ﬁnally turned a proﬁt? Or because John heard the advice of doctors at Johns Hopkins hospital to whom he sent Archie to aid her recovery? Or perhaps it was a res ult of rearrange- ments at 300 High Street after the death of Harriet James Eaton, when her widower and two small children moved in so that the aunts could become surrogate mothers? Whatever the reason, at last Archie had a home of her own. But still she did not really resume painting. Important though it was to have her own home, perhaps the problem of outperforming her husband loomed even larger. T oday the sit-uation might be labeled “fear of success,” the condition where a person with high achievement motivation and fears of nega-tive consequences veers away from potential accomplishments. The anxiety aroused by doing something successful cannot be tolerated, so it is simpler to avoid achievement-oriented activ-ities. But labeling the phenomenon does not diminish the dreadful unease felt by a woman like Archie when the exercise of her talents may threaten her marriage. Ostensibly the reason why Archie did not paint was myopia; she had become so nearsighted that she could not see from subject to easel, even with thick lenses. Archie used models even when she painted scenes composed in her imagination, so her painting depended on adequate vision."

Bates in 1920 and developed in the following decades, myopia may result from tension in muscles around the eye-ball, thus “causing the eyeball to distort in various ways. If the strain is unrelieved, the muscles remain tense, and the distortion worsens and/or becomes ‘permanent.’” 3 With Bates’s explanation it is not so difﬁcult to understand that visual defects might at ﬁrst be selective, disappearing in more relaxed circumstances, only to become ﬁxed if the strain goes unrelieved. “It also becomes evident that the visual defect that results from the strain may be a reaction that ‘saves’ the viewer, or provides an ‘escape’ from a stressful situation. If the viewer cannot see the object . . . he or she certainly cannot be expected to provide an appropriate response.” 4 Myopia gave Archie a “good” reason for not painting. What, then, was she to do as her energies returned? She now had a home to manage, but that did not represent an adequate out-let for her mental energies. Indeed, she might be expected to feel more energetic once that long-awaited goal was attained. Archie’s solution was to write plays and poems, thus calling on her inner vision without depending on her eyes. Before her illness Archie had begun work on a play called The Admirable Crichton , a tragedy about a sixteenth-century Scotsman who killed a braggart robber who had been prey-ing on the populace of Mantua, only to perish himself at the hand of an unappreciative prince of the realm. This tor-tured tale, written in blank verse, was submitted for copy-right in February 1913. Archie began the research and perhaps the writing in 1904, before she succumbed to nervous pros-tration, and probably worked on it from time to time as her health permitted. Perhaps Archie l earned about James Crichton years before when the Sewall family visited Mantua. He would have been a suitable subject for one of the stories she told her sisters"

He earned a master’s degree from St. Andrews in 1575 and then set out to see the world, visiting Paris, Venice, and Padua before he was killed in Mantua at the age of twenty-two. His story captured the imagination, for after his death he was memorialized in 1603 by John Johnston, the compiler of Heroes Scotici , as “The Admirable Crichton,” a title retained by Sir Thomas Urquhart in his 1652 tale of the “Discovery of a most exquisite jewel.” Interest in him seems to have revived in the early twentieth century, for biographies by P . F. T yler and Douglas Crichton were published in 1909. No doubt Archie was drawn to Crichton as an example of a capable and scholarly young man who, like her husband, failed because others did not properly appreciate him. Writing the play gave her an opportunity to work over the theme of mas-culine failure in a time and a setting far from Urbana. Perhaps in doing so she came to grips with some of her own feelings about the problems John encountered so that she could bet-ter accept that life does not always reward good intentions or sterling character. The fact that she was writing plays indicates that Archie had recovered sufﬁciently to undertake a limited form of creative work. If she had really wished to return to painting, it would seem that she could have worked without models and painted her interior visions directly onto canvas. Perhaps her undated and unﬁnished self-portrait from this time was an attempt to do so, and was aborted because she could not bear to paint the anguish t hat shows so clearly in her e yes. Such poems as “Horizons” suggest that Archie may have felt that she was meant to leave painting and take on an “interior mission”: And some there are, who hindered more and more, Led from the open by interior mission"

She accepted Swedenborg’s idea that a wife may bring spiritual happiness to her husband through such special qualities of her mind as an “afﬁrmative attitude” and “percep-tive understanding.” Archie described her belief in an unpub-lished manuscript titled “The Garden Gate”: The Inmost of a man has always happiness in it. He is rarely able to reach it without a woman’s love, because he has no understanding of his own Good. The Inmost of a woman has no abiding happiness in it unless she can reach her husband’s happiness . . . She rises and falls with what she can bring out—(educate?)—of her husband’s happiness. The woman by her peculiar mind can perceive the interior happiness in her husband’s Good when he himself cannot perceive it. Then her Perceptive Understanding is fed by it, and the outer Understanding and Good of each rejoice together in it. The man can know that he has some happiness and that it has been reached, only when the outer Good of his wife overﬂows with it. 6 Archie thought it a wife’s responsibility to “sensitize” her perceptive understanding through her own spiritual develop- ment, for “by this she can come to perceive and sustain her husband’s happiness even in the utmost opposition of ﬁxed things—that is, when everything seems to be against it.” 7 “The Garden Gate” describes a process of spiritual develop- ment through “fear and faith,” a process deepened by concern for others.

As a newspaper editor John had a platform for his lifelong interest in politics. His primary attention was devoted to local issues, but on a national level he was particularly interested in William Jennings Bryan, who waged unsuccessful campaigns for the presidency in 1896, 1900, and 1908. Bryan was inﬂuential in securing the nomination for Woodrow Wilson in 1912, which resulted in Bryan’s appointment as Secretary of State in Wilson’s cabinet. Archie’s uncle, Arthur Sewall of Bath, Maine, was Bryan’s running mate in 1896, which created a personal connection with Bryan for John. In 1913, Bryan invited John to work in the Bureau of Information at the State Department, a job that involved the preparation and transmission of US inter-pretations of international law to diplomatic representatives abroad. Bryan resigned over a policy difference with Wilson in June 1915, but John stayed on at the State Department for the remainder of Wilson’s ﬁrst term.

Apparently Archie and her father were the prime movers in the scheme to adopt David. It is not clear how John felt about thus acquiring a son, although Archie’s goddaughter, Elise Campbell, commented years later that he seemed uninvolved with David as an infant. 2 There can be no question, though, about Archie’s inter- est in children. Throughout her life the mother-infant duo had a special appeal, beginning with the Madonnas she drew on Sunday afternoons in her childhood. She went on to paint many Madonnas, foremost among them The Holy Family of 1904. When her eyes did not permit painting, Archie sculpted a Madonna. Her statement to Alice Memmott that her long engagement represented “ten years wasted” perhaps reﬂected a feeling that an earlier mar riage might have produced children. Archie was forty-three and had been married for ﬁfteen years when David arrived. By that time her two married sisters had children, which perhaps intensiﬁed her own hopes for mater-nity. She had recovered from her breakdown and had enough energy to care for a child. One might wonder why Frank Sewall undertook to pro- vide a child for Archie. Perhaps he was motivated primarily by the baby’s need for a family. Possibly he felt that Archie’s life would get back on track if she experienced motherhood. He may have sensed his own mortality and undertaken to pro-vide a substitute for himself in her life. Probably he assumed that John would continue to work for the federal government anticipated that Archie would continue to make her home in Washington where she could raise a child in her own way without interference from John’s sisters.

Her desire to share the pleasures she found in life with a child is captured in a poem dedicated to her son: Come, little one; sit at the banquet beside me. Beauty is serving, all the great pleasures coming, Clouds, and races, and ships, and violins humming, T rees in the wind, and friends to be longed for after, Broken words in the heat of the dance, and laughter, Mountains, and mortal glory perhaps 4 A child might make it possible to recapture the sense of comradeship Archie had shared with her father, to pass along to the next generation the satisfactions she had known in the child-parent relationship. A child would also bring a spiritual sphere into the home. Archie took seriously Swedenborg’s view of infancy as a period when angels are in attendance, mediating knowledge of quin-tessential good and truth that will guard and guide the per-son throughout life. Thus in another poem dedicated to David titled “T o a Baby Sleeping” she wrote: Not slumbering merely Nor taking repose! Some energy clear ly At work in thee goes.

Justice Hughes disdained to return the child’s greeting. However winsome David may have seemed to his mother, not everyone was equally taken with him. The unappreciative included John’s sisters, who refused to consider David a full-ﬂedged member of the James family. The kind of responsibility Archie felt as a mother is docu- mented in her “Notes on the Making of a Home,” 6 which, as noted in a previous chapter, describes her understanding of the process of creating a home such as that which Archie knew as a child and now wished to recreate for her own son. The “Notes” are organized into twelve “elements” that indicate the idealism with which Archie approached parenthood: I: A Sense of the Lord II: A Sense of the Unity of Father and Mother III: A Sense of Praise IV: A Sense of Form V: Gatherings and Scatterings VI: A Sense of Invariable Centers VII: A Sense of the Christian Y ear VIII: A Sense of Festival and of Everyday IX: A Sense of Processions X: Games and a Sense of Play"

The “Concluding Remarks” section of the document expresses that she felt the value of these elements was already demonstrated in the “ﬁnished lives” of herself and her sisters: The result of these twelve elements has been already tested by ﬁnished lives: and it can be promised that, when woven into the life blood of the child they will enable him to discriminate his state of mind, to perfect each in its own place: will establish taste, that is, a knowing from experience what is ﬁne and what is common, what is lofty and what is precious, and what is useful but only external or ordinary; will set him in the habit of placing festivals along his road, of seeing order everywhere, of ﬁtting part by part together out of the . . . circumstances into a temple for his God. Each element is described in terms of its purpose and the ways in which the household and family life are organized to achieve that purpose, both in everyday life and on special occasions.

Mother’s place in the library is near him but subservient. The sense of place anchors the wandering mind, stabilizes and enthrones the reason. There should be different places for the different occupations of the child, each selected perhaps by some perception of his own, or because of its obvious suitability, and suggesting by its outlook, or its light, or its erectness or softness, etc.,—the special thing he can do in it. It blesses his material world by dignifying every corner of it to a special use which he loves. It helps him interiorly to select and form his place in heaven. All these centers, once chosen, should be as inviolable as possible. A sense of place should connect him outdoors with the ground, the arrangement of the trees, the lay of the land, the footing, especially the outlook or view; should cultivate a sense of front, or place where to look, and of back, or place where not to look; also a constant physical relation to the sun, moon, and stars and their changes. The sense of centers (of place) is his material, physical and spiritual orientation. Throughout her life Archie keenly felt the importance of a sense of place, outdoors as well as in, as illustrated in a 1906 letter to her father in which she recalled the “many little homes,” special places they had found on walks in the coun-tryside during his visit to her at a farm near Urbana, each spot named and treasured. At “Vox Pacis,” Archie reported to her father, “I spent some time building a broad seat at the foot of the little tree . . .

However, it must have been difﬁcult to transplant Sewall family traditions, which grew out of the per-sonality and convictions of Archie’s father, an “artist in liv-ing,” and her mother, a willing helpmeet. For instance, the love of walking in the countryside, which Frank Sewall learned in his student days in Germany and transmitted to his daugh-ters, did not have the same signiﬁcance for Archie’s husband. John walked about eight blocks to downtown Urbana every day to conduct business or get a newspaper, and made expe-ditions into the country by horse and buggy for practical pur-poses such as visiting farms or collecting rents, rather than for the sheer pleasure of enjoying the outdoors. No doubt David’s personality and his modes of response also introduced complications in the application of Archie’s prin-ciples. Living in Washington for the ﬁrst years of David’s life gave her a chance to try out some of her childrearing ideas before having to make the even more difﬁcult adaptation to the James family home where, even if John tolerated her approach, she would have to run the gauntlet of his sisters’ reactions. Even as this new family member entered Archie’s life, she must have been aware that the end of her father’s life was approaching. Frank Sewall was aging, and in 1915 it was dis-covered that he had cancer. Archie dedicated a sonnet to him, “the comrade of all her growth”: Oh pass not yet into serenity, Comrade of all my growth, nor seek to hide Y our blessedness from me.

Archie’s father had been her principal source of support, her inspiration, her guide. With him she had a rare companionship, which he also trea-sured. Evidently Frank wrote of his closeness to his daughter when he proposed her for membership in the Literary Society of Washington, for in reply the secretary of the Society wrote, “How beautiful a thing the relationship of you and your daugh-ter must be, each to fully appreciate and understand the work of the other, and how each of you must act as incentive to the other, and respond to sympathetic criticisms and suggestions!” 9 But the time was coming for separation. In July 1915, Frank Sewall began outlining his autobiography, to be titled “Felix, or Reminisces of a Happy Life.” Archie explains his choice of the name Felix: “When Frank Sewall . . . was on the eve of his ﬁf-tieth birthday, climbing upward on a Scotch mountain in the face of an approaching thunderstorm, he paused to relish the ﬁne mist and the spring of the heather under his enthusiastic feet and remarked to the young and beloved companion at his side, ‘My name should have been Felix. Frank is a good name, but it does not so fully express my life as Felix would have—it has been so very happy.’” 10 Frank soon realized that he would not be able to complete his autobiography and showed Archie his outline and diaries, asking her to write it for him and use the title he had selected. Soon after his death in December 1915, Archie wrote a pen-ciled sheet entitled “F. S. Summary” describing the essence of his life as she saw it:"

This makes it possible to examine difﬁcult situations that may not be openly addressed. Archie knew British and European history well and had lear ned years before, when she told bedtime stories about the next day’s sightseeing to her sis-ters, to see it in dramatic terms that featured the adventures of historical personages. Now she drew upon that knowledge for plots involving situations that troubled her but that needed to be handled without exposing her feelings to those close to her. The Conquest features Rosamund, the outspoken wife of a Kentish baron, Godfrey of Stourmouth. Rosamund is criti-cal of her husband for transferring his loyalty to William the Conqueror after the battle of Hastings. She refuses hospitality to the Normans when Godfrey brings them to his castle and thus sets the scene for conﬂict with her husband. Rosamund sees herself as the keeper of the faith, true to the principles her husband has taught her. As she says, I am the best of Godfrey . . . The keeper of his troth"

Precious to me The faith of Godfrey if not to himself.13 Godfrey adapts to change and yields to the exigencies of conquest, only to ﬁnd that his wife, who does not understand the circumstances that alter his perspective, is not ready to be so ﬂexible. When he persuades her that she must act hospi-table, she goes through the motions but makes it plain that it violates her conscience, telling her guests, And surely what my husband asks is just. From the deep credence of my marriage vows I greet you willingly against my will. 14 Godfrey is sufﬁciently angered by his wife’s intransi- gence to order her to leave and asks the Norman bishop to divorce them. The Normans view Godfrey’s treatment of his wife as boorish. One of them, Roland de Conches, rescues Rosamund and intends to marry her himself until he real-izes that she is driven by her anger at Godfrey rather than by interest in him. The Conquest is a play about marriage, about the roles of a wife and a husband who wrestle with a basic difference of opinion, the ensuing anger, and the forgiveness that eventu-ally heals the breach. The wife, Rosamund, is caught between principles and person. When she is loyal to the principles she holds dear, taught her by parents and husband, she offends her husband, who is coping with practicalities she does not comprehend. She acts on the basis of her principles, speaking out boldly, scolding and angry with her husband for his devi-ance. When he is goaded beyond endurance, embarrassed by her outspokenness and insistence upon idealism, and asks the bishop to dissolve the marriage, Rosamund acts helpless, say-ing, “Where would you have me go—what shall I do? I must obey you.”"

The process of working out mutual accommodations can be beset with pitfalls, especially for couples like John and Archie. Archie was taught to express, analyze, and defend convictions taken over from her father, certiﬁed by his clergy status as a Good Man. These principles probably went unchallenged for twenty-eight years, until she and John mar-ried—as was also the case with John’s inherited sense of right and wrong. When their differences surfaced, it was on John’s home ground, so that the James approach was reinforced while the Sewall approach could survive only with Archie’s deter-mined defense. Doubtless there were times when Archie got frustrated and angry. She must have known what it was like to defend prin-ciples that she cherished only to ﬁnd her stance in conﬂict with the personal opinions and needs of her husband. Perhaps John’s illnesses, like Godfrey’s wounds, forced Archie to rec-ognize her wish to care for John and swallow her anger. Did she, like Rosamund, l earn that a nger over principles can seem judgmental and bring out a man’s vulnerability? The Conquest proposes that love may conquer a woman’s anger, but Archie also made a statement about a wife’s needs. Proud of her own heritage—“pure Norman on both sides,” she told John Cavanaugh 18—Archie took pains to contrast Norman chivalry and ideas of romantic love with Anglo Saxon (James) traditions. As Rosamund says, the Norman Roland de Conches “Knows better than the best of Kent the succour / Belonging any woman from her husband.” The Tower Builder (1916) presents the tragic tale of Klaus, who loses, through no fault of his own, the girl he loves, the coveted commission to build a tower, the respect and accep-tance of his father, and even the loyalty of his dog.

It may have represented a way for Archie to work through her feelings about the fail-ures that beset John after yet another promising venture, the State Department appointment, was doomed by Bryan’s res-ignation. Archie had trouble deciding on a title for this play, which she also called The Blood Royal . The central character, Klaus, was raised as the son of the governor of Linz but was born the son of the Archduke Leopold and was therefore a prince in his own right. His royalty asserted itself when he magnanimously forgave Prince Rupert for disrupting his life. As a play The Tower Builder is confusing and difﬁcult to fol- low, and lacks the expertise de monstrated in earlier plays such as Crichton or The Conquest . This, however, makes it all the more useful as a guide to Archie’s state of mind. She knew how to be a better playwright, but her expertise did not come through for this play. She might have been distracted with the care of David, who was a little over two when the play was ﬁnished, but more likely the problem was that the themes she set out to explore represented fresh and deep wounds. In the midst of his despair Klaus says to Prince Rupert, Mayhap there is a heavenly ordered course Of mortal s uffering, whereby t hose hearts That most can wound each other most do meet.19 Archie thought that divine purpose might explain how friends could be the instruments of such hurt.

T o Archie, who at last had brought the longed-for son into the James family, this must have felt like the ultimate treachery. If it seemed to her that a divine pur-pose, ﬁnally revealed when her father found David, was involved in the years of disappointment over not having a child, it was possible that “a heavenly ordered course of mor-tal suffering” was also involved in the refusal to accept her son. For all the James sisters knew, David might be of royal blood, a prince unrecognized in their midst. Given a chance, he might, like Klaus, qualify for prizes as a designer and builder of civic monuments, even if his royalty was not acknowledged. Perhaps Archie thought that spiritual health was tested when friendships resulted in the suffering engendered by such wounds. As for herself, she was required to ﬁnd forgiveness in her soul even though she was badly hurt, just as she portrays Klaus in relation to Rupert. After speaking on Rupert’s behalf, Klaus gives him some advice: When you have a son T each him to forgive before his blame Have speech.

The composition of the family living there had changed since Archie and John had moved out in 1908 or 1909. John's mother had died in 1911. Margaret realized that her sister T rudie showed symptoms of the same crippling arthritis that afﬂicted her mother and was determined to dedicate her life to the care of her sister. The extended James family continued to grow. Russell Eaton had moved into the James house with his two small children following the death of his wife Harriet—possibly one of the events that prompted Archie and John to get their own apartment—and in 1914 he married Frances (Franny) James. By 1917, Russell and Franny had two children, making a total of four young Eatons in the household. The Eaton children were well entrenched in the affections of their aunts, who did not consider David to be a “real” James. Archie was faced with the challenge of raising a child accord- ing to her own unique principles in the midst of a doubting and critical family. Given Archie’s expectations—based on ide-alized memories of her parents’ roles—it probably would have been difﬁcult to arrive at a meeting of the minds with John about his paternal role even in the privacy of a home of their own.

A hint of the complica-tions involved comes from a niece, Harriet Eaton Whitehead, who recalls that Archie would read Shakespeare to David in his high chair at lunchtime, oblivious to the fact that he was throwing his food on the ﬂoor. 1 Perhaps David would have preferred more personalized attention, but Archie was intent on creating a proper sphere, doing her best to surround him with beautiful language. The scene was set for complications for both Archie and David. David was not only rejected as a James, but he was sur-rounded by children who were “in” when he was “out,” and the judgment continued even though the Eatons soon moved to Massachusetts. David got mixed signals, his mother often favoring a course of action criticized by the rest of the fam-ily. His father’s tendency to ignore disagreements among the women or handle them with humor probably added to the complications with which Archie had to deal. Did David know of his adoption? Perhaps not. Marian May Clarke remembers that Archie “wanted everyone to erase from their minds the fact of David’s (adoption) and think of him as her own child. Given her total involvement with the spiritual world, her concept of it, I can see that it would seem possible to her to bring him that close. With his different games and a normal child’s reactions, no wonder he was ‘difﬁcult,’ trying to deal with such a silver cord with its double strands of spiritu-ality and physical reality.” 2 Differences of opinion in the James family about chil- dren going to church probably inspired an article that Archie wrote for the New Church Review, a Swedenborgian news-letter. In it, she notes that “height, grandeur, spaces of silence, awe and wonder” are lacking in rooms provided for Sunday schools, thus not ﬁlling a child’s need for the “loftiest things . . . the altar with the great open Book, its attendant ﬂowers,"

How could that happen if he were shunted off to dingy Sunday school rooms and knew nothing of the splendors that he could ﬁnd in the mysteries of the church? Archie argued that chil-dren learn responsibility for the future in the ir ear ly years: “It is the children who are living; it is we who are going . . . What things haunt them with beauty, urge them with affection, restrain them from habit; are being forged and bolted now into the framework of all future covenants among men.” 4 A child caught in David’s circumstances might be expected to be “difﬁcult.” T o be asked to conform to his mother’s ide-als, yet never able to measure up to James family expectations, would snare a child in a no-win situation. When he was about nine, Archie took David to Michigan for a vacation, staying at the same boarding house as her god-daughter, Elise Campbell. No doubt Archie hoped that David would beneﬁt from getting away from all the complications in Urbana, which probably increased during the annual summer visit of the Eaton family. Elise, a child psychologist, recalls that Archie considered David a very emotional, “passionate” child, “full of temper and difﬁculty,” and that Archie was “gentle with her son, never forceful.” 5 Then John decided that David should go to live in Oregon with Archie’s sister, Bess Schellenberg, even though Bess already had her hands full with three daughters. Archie took him there and insisted on leaving him, saying that David would die if he couldn’t stay. Several explanations are available for this arrangement. Archie told a friend 6 that David had been stealing and needed to leave Urbana before he disgraced the family and was labeled a thief.

Y ears later, Archie told still another friend8 that John made the decision for David to leave home because of the continuing problem of Margaret countermanding Archie’s directives to her son. Perhaps both explanations apply but, in any case, Archie’s son lived away from home during the concluding years of his childhood. John sent $100 a month for his expenses, but David effectively became part of the Schellenberg family, so much so that Bess feared that he would not be able to reintegrate with his own family. T o forestall this, he was sent back to Ohio with a friend who was traveling east. But David still did not ﬁt in well in Urbana. Next he was sent to live in Cambridge, Massachusetts, with John’s eldest sister, Abbe Hite, and her family, and there he graduated from gram-mar school in June 1925. David moved back home to attend Urbana High School, but life continued to be difﬁcult for him. His piano teacher, Kingsley Ganson, describes him as gifted musically. 9 He could read music and had perfect pitch, but would not practice. He resented Archie’s attendance at his music lessons and talked to her disrespectfully, calling her an “old onion” and telling her to get out. Archie appeared to be oblivious to his attitude and behavior, but she must have been disappointed that the son for whom she had hoped so much turned out to be so alienated and disdainful. Whatever empathy Archie had with David as a child must have been shattered by the time he was in his late teens. T o Archie, who had grown up in a family of girls in a situation where it was unthinkable to challenge a parent’s vision of what a child should do and be, David’s behavior must have been almost incomprehensible. Archie and John never had a car, yet David fancied automobiles; they favored the music of Bach, Haydn, Chopin, but David sought pleasure in popular music and collected 78-RPM records that must have grated"

A fellow student at Urbana University,10 who met David when he was in his late teens, recalls that Archie had precon-ceived ideas of what a James should be like—musical, liter-ary, culturally minded—and that David at that time was just the opposite, interested in cars, athletics, and jazz. The young woman shared an enthusiasm for Bix Beiderbecke with David, who invited her to listen to his records. After two such occasions, Archie informed her that she should never kiss a man until she was married. There had been no roman-tic overtures but they never “dated” again. From this account, it sounds as if Archie joined the rest of the family in being critical of David, looking upon his friendships and activities with suspicion. But Archie did not give up on trying to communicate the values she treasured and lived by. When David went to col-lege in Denver she sent him a daily reading, short and pithy, to instruct him in Swedenborgian thought. These messages, later gathered together under the title of “The Garden Gate” and addressed “to the youth of the world,” distill thirty vol-umes of Swedenborg’s theological writing into thoughts to live by, explaining the role of the individual human in the divine scheme of things. Archie’s daily messages to David were such as these: Since the h eart of man must be e xpanded to the utmost before he enters Heaven, the Lord insinuates through the ﬁrst afﬁrmative attitude not only a growing peace, but a sense of merriment. For it is peace and merriment together t hat even in this world expand t he heart. 11 Swedenborg says all happinesses ﬂow into beauty. T o be distinctly one’s own person, doing what one longs to do"

He has more time, he has more strength: because to have the Word in mind—even a jot or a tittle of it—is to have the expansive, creative sympathy and substance of Divine Love in mind, which spreads down and out to physical and concrete life—even every jot and tittle of it. 13 Some observers describe David’s presence in the James fam- ily as a “tragedy . . . a disaster.” As Dan Nielsen sums it up, “David just did not belong. He was not the type. Another boy, sensitive, responsive to the beautiful would have been a lucky child in their presence. Not David’s fault, not anyone’s, really. David was a tall, handsome young fellow when I knew him in 1932, but certainly not a likely son of such a couple as the Jameses.” 14 Possibly David would have ﬁt into the family if he had been welcomed by John’s sisters. He might even have tolerated Archie’s idealistic mothering if the other adults around him had supported her. Indeed, Archie’s ideas about raising chil-dren might have been tempered by David’s responses if she had been in a more relaxed situation in which there would be less tendency to defensively hang onto her principles. But the situation was almost impossible. Archie, who by all rights should have mothered the next generation of the James fam-ily, lost out to the two maiden aunts, Margaret and Fanny, who fostered the Eaton babies, thereafter considered to be the next generation of the James family.

John, whose long-prac-ticed defense against women who disagreed was to keep his thoughts to himself and stay out of the fray, apparently sel-dom asserted himself as a father. In this situation Archie had no real support and plenty of criticism. Her desire to make David her own child spiritually and have everyone forget that he was adopted would have been difﬁcult to bring about under the most auspicious circumstances. Her father’s death left her bereft of her principal source of support and left David with-out a strong advocate. It is possible to envision another scenario with a very differ- ent outcome for both David and Archie. If Archie and John had stayed longer in Washington, or if they had had a home of their own in Urbana, or if Frank Sewall had lived longer and been available as counsel and comrade to Archie, or if John had been more aggressive about shaping the situation in which his son grew up—any one of these factors could have encouraged Archie to modify her ideals in response to David’s personality. It might have meant that he felt more accepted. But none of those supportive circumstances existed, and Archie was faced with coping in an unappreciative and sometimes hostile envi-ronment. Having grown up surrounded by girls—in a situation where rebelliousness was unthinkable—thinking that she knew what was good and true, and pushed toward a more spiritual approach to life by the death of her father, Archie relied on her own distillation of the principles on which she had been raised.

Answer! 15 In response the Lamb of God says, “The entrance of my words giveth light.” That light is represented by the burning bush experienced by Moses alone in the wilderness, convey-ing the impression that God will answer the woes of moth-ers dealing with the uncharted future into which they accom-pany their children. In the pageant mothers are supposed to express reassurance, for they move offstage “quickly in atti-tudes of gladness, conﬁdent that God will supply the wisdom and resources needed to parent the children of the worlds beyond us.” How aptly this describes Archie’s experience! She married with a sense of hope and expectations about building on her Sewall heritage. When that hope was dashed, she could not go back home to the known and cherished, for marriage was con-sidered a sacred bond “for better or for worse.” Having now lost her father as comrade and guide, she felt alone in the wil-derness.

Her plays were carefully researched and survive in polished versions that must have received a number of revisions. 1 Her productivity and the quality of her output during these years suggest that she maintained a regular schedule of writing, probably organizing her days to include periods of uninterrupted work, much as she had scheduled for painting before she was taken ill. Writing was creative fun for Archie. She loved to play with words and, even more, enjoyed working out concepts. She expressed the enjoyment of giving form to ideas in the sonnet “While Making a Play”: Oh, for a pure deep sonnet, order grown, Where thought can walk in ways prepared for him; Arbors and avenues, forest walled and dim Around that one pool of sequestered brown!

No longer based in the long ago and far away, this play is set in the present and depicts two soldiers in a dugout in No Man’s Land, talking of their doubts about the value of life and of war. They are ultimately killed in a rocket attack, but not until a sequence of characters from Sunday school Christmas pageants has appeared to them, transforming their bitterness and hesitations into an afﬁrmation of the meaning of life and the acceptance of religious belief. Christmas Eve shows Archie as a playwright coming to grips with the here and now, accepting the reality of war and death and depicting faith as progressing from the childhood Sunday school stage to a signiﬁcant adult reality. She used the familiar Sewall family form, a play written as a Christmas gift, but this time transformed its content from the world of fairy tales to that of contemporary reality. Next Archie turned to a comedy, The Honor of Jaffrey , com- pleted in 1918. This also is set in France during World War I and is a zany tale of mistaken identity involving two men named Jaffrey, one of whom married a woman named Honor just before leaving for the front.

He aims to save his king, who is about to visit the front, from a gas attack. Everything works out in the end; the inventor succeeds and the couple is reunited, but there is considerable suspense before the denouement. Beneath the folderol, Honor is a play about marriage and about a woman’s confusion over which of two persons is her husband. Archie may well have been debating this ques-tion when she contrasted the John who was her partner when they lived in Washington, away from his family, with the dif-ferent person he again had proved to be when living in the midst of his family. It is unlikely that this question could have been addressed openly, but the deft hand of comedy permit-ted Archie to explore it in the form of ﬁctional characters and distant circumstances, thus making it possible to express a domestic difﬁculty by projecting it into an acceptable pub-lic form. Would Archie herself, like Honor, experience a happy ending, once again ﬁnding her true husband, even in the sur-roundings of his ancestral home? The Barn of Bethlehem The next play which can be dated is The Barn of Bethlehem , com- pleted in November 1920. For many years Archie read this nativity play in the Urbana Swedenborgian church at Christ-mas time. It combines whimsy and religious insight, showing that those who believe in the Christ child’s birth—a little boy, an old shepherd, and the three kings—experience the Nativity in a barn in Bethlehem while it remains invisible to those who disbelieve—the innkeeper and his wife and the young Pilate. Written when David was six years old, the character of the lit-tle boy was probably inspired by him and the plot of the play by the way Archie wanted him to experience the festival of the"

The Biography of Frank Sewall During 1920 and 1921, Archie began work on her father’s biography, as she had promised him she would. Three sections were published in the New Church Review : “The Boyhood of Frank Sewall” in January 1921; “Frank Sewall at Bowdoin” in July 1921; and “Frank Sewall’s Student Life in Italy” in April 1923. Archie also wrote a fourth section dealing with her father’s studies in Germany and France, but it was never pub-lished, apparently because Archie did not make some changes requested by the editor of the Review . For these articles, Archie drew upon her father’s diaries for lively sketches of his interests and personality, presenting his life and the ideas which animated it through dramatic descrip-tions of the setting in which he grew up and its inﬂuences on him. Archie’s close identiﬁcation with her father shines through as she recreates experiences of his life in vibrant detail. Poems probably written about the same time show the con- tinuing intensity of Archie’s involvement with her father, as in “Comrades”: I walking below, Y ou, above: I through paths of June Y ou, through love. I craving you here, Y ou urging me there, And silence and the dull air And the one tear Between us everywhere."

It depicts t he ear ly history of Urbana from the days of Indians and Jesuit mission-aries until the Civil War. The pageant unfolds on “three planes of action, the lowest and nearest being of the multitude, the middle distance of intellectual progress, the inner and highest of symbolic appeals and the answering vision.” 5 The Torch required extensive historical research, much of it using the resources of the James family library, which included a large collection of letters and memorabilia about local his-tory. Archie was in her element, combining authentic his-tory with a spiritual message and fun on a grand scale. Some 1,100 people were involved in presenting the pageant, which included an orchestra, choir, and dancers, as well as actors and “multitudes.” Others worked for weeks to create costumes and round up props—including a Conestoga wagon—and to make arrangements for a historic train to pass on the n earby railroad track at just the right moment. An audience of six thousand witnessed The Torch , including participants in the national convention of the Swedenborgian Church then in session in Urbana.

This play once again utilizes three planes, “foreground for historic action, middle distance for symbolic action, inner scene for the Vision.” Episodes from critical moments in American history are interspersed with interludes about the weaknesses of past empires (Egypt, Greece, Rome). The W atcher is a densely packed exposition of ideas presented in dramatic form. It demonstrates a thorough knowledge of history but would challenge even a skilled producer and demand the most thoughtful of patriotic audiences.

Social Issues Archie’s next play was The Rising: A Tragedy of the Times . Set in a mythical kingdom in Eastern Europe in 1914, it deals with the awakening of the exploited masses and the dependence of Western technology on Eastern oil resources. The drama revolves around royal characters who take various positions in relation to the issues of the times: an idealistic young prince, inﬂuenced by reading Bryce and de T ocqueville, who makes friends with a camel driver ready to lead an incipi-ent revolution; a princess who is convinced that the steam engines and electricity of the Western world represent prog-ress; an aged king and conservative bishop who treasure the values of the past. All are lost in the revolution that sweeps away the old order. The Rising indicates Archie’s awareness of the changing times. Born and educated in a nineteenth-century world that carried over until Archie became ill in 1905, she was, to all intents and purposes, “out of it” during her illness. But it would have been difﬁcult to remain disengaged in the James household, where it was the custom to read and discuss thoughtful periodicals like Harper’s , the daily New Y ork paper, and articles in local newspapers. While Archie maintained the genteel perspective with which she was raised, and might be considered snobbish and racist by today’s standards, her sympathy for the under-privileged and understanding of their aspirations is evident. The Rising shows comprehension of political and social circum- stances of the early twentieth ce ntury. On a more personal level, it makes a powerful statement that the old order must pass and give way to change, and perhaps also reﬂects Archie’s hope for change on the home front."

The dedication reads, “T o the handmaid of Apollo, Margaret L. James, this little comedy of God is affectionately dedicated.” The theme of the play is the difﬁculty of experiencing God in personal terms. The time and place of Clouds is described as “The Mind of Man.” The play opens with Zeus feeling Hindered in my gifts. Vapors of earth And fogs of mind Float in between me and the human kind. A cloudy door They shut upon my love. Can I do more? In response, Apollo begs to be sent, “Man to restore / T o thy delight” and thereafter presents himself in human form at one of his shrines. He is recognized by an innocent pair of lov-ers, a young shepherd and shepherdess, but the other charac-ters cannot believe his presence is possible. At one point the shepherdess says to the watching Muses, “I think it is Apollo himself! He is sitting in the family.” And the Muses reply, “She thinks it is Apollo himself? And where else should he be but in the family? She does not know that human families are the rewards of the gods! It is permitted so in the law of Zeus! They bless each other, they feed each other! Heaven is mutual.” Archie considered the ancient Greeks to be representatives of what Swedenborg termed the “ Ancient Church.” Using “church” to denote a spiritual era, rather than an ediﬁce or an organization, Swedenborg described the people of the “Most Ancient” church as “celestial” and able to know God in person, while the “spiritual” people of the “ Ancient” church knew God in symbolic form, such as that of the gods in Greek mythol-ogy.

Apollo, the Greek god who drove the sun chariot across the skies, skillfully negotiating the treacherous orbit from dawn to dusk, engaged Archie’s artistic imagination as a poet and play-wright and, later, as a painter also. The play focuses on the recognition of Apollo and his presence in everyday affairs, attempting to clear away the “fogs of mind” that keep humans from being receptive to God’s love. Clouds can be considered a key to Archie’s state of mind in 1924, an indication that she was concerned with the question of the presence of God in the complex interactions of the family, whether or not the family acknowledged divine involvement. Why, then, did Archie dedicate Clouds to her sister-in- law Margaret and describe her as the “handmaid of Apollo?” Margaret, the eldest James sister at home, managed the house-hold and gardens; she maintained order in the home and supervised servants and meals; and she nursed relatives, both close family and various aunts and cousins who came to live at the James home in their old age. Some felt that she brought a personal touch to a somewhat austere household. As one young visitor remembers, “T ea was served in delicate china cups from a polished silver service with thin bread and but-ter prepared by Miss Margaret. She seems mostly to have been busy about the house, but she was congenial and I found myself more relaxed with her than with either of the others who were somewhat awesome, John James on Olympian intel-lectual heights and Archie an ethereal spirit. Margaret was brisk, matter of fact, and a little sardonic.” 7 Margaret perhaps considered herself to be a “Mart ha,” a woman dedicated to practical personal service. Was Archie trying to tell her something about her importance to the fam-ily? Was the play an attempt to heal the rift that could have"

Assuming that Archie could have written any one of a number of plays in 1924, we ﬁnd that she chose to write in a mythological vein about the theme of personal awareness of God, and to dedicate the result to her sister-in-law. Did Archie wish that Margaret felt closer to the Divine? Or did she simply feel it was an appropriate time to dedicate something to her? In 1925 Archie turned to the theme of marriage in a four- act play entitled Goodness Knows , which was rewritten with the addition of some minor characters in 1927. The central ﬁgure, Kate Cornwall, has evidence of the innocence of two brothers, anarchists who have been accused of bombing a big-business property. Unsuccessful in persuading her husband to inter-vene with the governor before the deadline for their execu-tion, Kate goes to the governor’s hotel room late at night to plead their case and gets caught in a compromising situation by a reporter eager to smear the governor. The action unfolds at a fast pace, with deft handling of double entendre and con-siderable suspense, showing Archie to be a skilled playwright. The central theme of Goodness Knows is the importance, durability, and power of marriage, embodied in speeches such as these: “But marriage, when it’s the genuine article can’t be shook.”8 “Something’s wrong in that home. But it ain’t going to wreck it.” 9 “I’ve seen a woman as a spiritual thing—to be believed in and died for . . . I’ve seen the home and the woman in it . . . It is real. It lasts and doesn’t move. It stays back there in goodness and never changes.” 10"

Possibly Goodness Knows was written in celebration of their silver anniversary. There are no indications of how Archie felt about her marriage at the time. Observers mention the courtly behavior of John James toward his wife, describ-ing their relationship as appearing “correct” but not particu-larly close.

Assuming that Archie chose to write the play because she wanted to explore the nature of marriage, Goodness Knows states the case for a relationship strong and trusting enough to ride out complications. Kate, the wife, puts the relationship to the test, for she goes ahead and does what she “knows” is right, even though it differs from her husband’s view. He then is required to be supportive of her, even when she puts him in an embarrassing position. All works out for the best in the end. Such circumstances may have occurred repeatedly in the James marriage. No doubt the play presents Archie’s ideal, perhaps in the hope that John would afﬁrm it also. There is no date on Mr. Hook Dines , but it was probably written in 1926. Mary Paul Caldwell recollects giving Archie a book she had enjoyed about Theophilus Hook and being intrigued when he became the central character in a play. 12 Mr. Hook Dines takes place in a “few hours on a dull evening” in London in 1819, during which a hungry Mr. Hook crashes a stuffy party and so amuses the guests and captivates his hosts that he and an impecunious actor-friend cadge their dinners. The theme is the power of wit and guile to overwhelm pro-priety. On the surface Mr. Hook is a very light play sprinkled with puns and spoofs on pretentious burghers. The action is fast-paced and again demonstrates Archie’s capability in writ-ing comedy. Most of Archie’s plays can be interpreted as dealing with themes of personal signiﬁcance to her, explored and worked over in depth through the medium of plot and characters removed from her own time and place. Since there is evidence that most of the plays make a personal statement, it is likely that Mr. Hook is more than an exercise in writing comedy. It pokes fun at stuffy parties but also depicts the humorist as being in control of the situation and getting what he wants. The year Mr. Hook Dines was written must have been a tense time in the James household. John’s sister T rudie was bed-"

David, then twelve, had returned to Urbana and there were questions about establishing the best plan for him. Archie had discovered the Bates method of improving eye-sight with exercise and was making progress toward her goal of being able to see well enough to paint, but probably found that the process of recovery was agonizingly slow. John was a very witty man who used humor to amuse his guests and, in all likelihood, to defuse tense family situations. There is no evidence of his exploiting others with his wit, as did Mr. Hook, but Archie may have had reason to recognize that wit can be a double-edged sword that wounds people who would prefer to be taken seriously. Perhaps she wanted to deliver a message to John about the uses of humor. Archie’s play-writing time in 1927 seems to have been devoted to revising Goodness Knows , which suggests that the theme of the vibrancy of marriage was uppermost for her at the time. Then, in 1928, she wrote Love Immortal , a comedy in four acts. This too is a play about marriage, but the focus is on the nature of love and the question of whether mar-riage restricts freedom to express individuality. Lady Daphne Meadows, a “young enthusiast for Humanity,” has estab-lished a utopian community on a “lost island in the Eastern Mediterranean.” She is searching for Individuality, which seems to require the abolition of love and home. T om Hawks, a sensible “young American Stone Engineer” who is overseeing quarrying on the island, wants Daphne to marry him, but she regards marriage as slavery and wants to abolish husbands and cut away “the tyranny of home . . . from the throat of humanity so that it can breathe.” The play proposes that conventional love is like a disease.

Everything that you need I supply with-out knowing it. I never have to think of you at all.” The result would be to “effectually quiet the marriage idea; and the neces-sity of homes” thus emphasizing that “Individuality is the par-amount necessity of the free, to round out the whole of expe-rience, having it marred nowhere by the clogwheel of another individual.” In the end Daphne realizes that she prefers T om Hawks and a home back in Dover, Massachusetts, to individuality and freedom from slavery to home and marriage. The emphasis is placed on women’s desires to take care of husbands, afﬁrmed by both Daphne and Lucy, the other young female character. But this does not come about until there has been substantial exposition of the merits of freeing marriage from the burden of traditional homemaking. Love Immortal caves in to custom, appearing to set aside the vision of individuality for women. But the question has been raised, and perhaps that is the signiﬁcant point in under-stand ing how things looked to Archie in 1928. She was ﬁfty-eight years old. She had been married for half of her life and had evolved a lifestyle, out of necessity, which freed her from the every day tyranny of homemaking. She had struggled with the com plex requirements of motherhood and, judging by the omis sion of women as mothers from her plays, had set aside active concern about mothering. While she continued to see her self as taking care of her husband, she recognized her own needs to be free of “the clogwheel of another individual.” She had learned t hat she, and she alone, could follow a regi- men which restored her eyesight and the possibility of resum-ing a career as an artist.

While marriage contin- ued to be important to her, as illustrated by the focus on the nature of the relationship in her plays, it must not be allowed to stand in the way of what she had to do as an individual. In the plays that focus on family issues, we ﬁnd Archie afﬁrming the importance of marriage and the place of the Divine in the family. But we also ﬁnd her protesting against the exploitation of others through humor and against the tyr-anny of conventional marriage. She reaches toward a future in which she permits herself to discover and establish her own individuality. Perhaps it was at this time that Archie wrote a sonnet entitled “February” to depict uncertainties of the future and personal growth. Now to be man is to arise! How bare At last the grass! How deep a birth awakes Old heritages in the mind that quakes With primitive foregone perceptions! There, Look how the stony ground becomes aware! That dappled rock has breathed!

In time her eyesight improved so that she no longer needed glasses.

The Lyceum Hall building was moved to the adjacent lot and, although owned by the college, it con-tinued to be available on an informal basis to church people.

In her ﬁrst career Archie had worked in tempera or oils, and the pictures painted around the turn of the century for exhibitions and competitions were in those media. When in the late 1920s she again began to do portraits, the medium was usually conte pencil, red for the more delicate subjects and black for the others. Occasionally she used pastel crayons, as for a portrait of her nephew David Blackmer dating to 1928. In July 1929 Archie painted The Departure of Eros , which depicted a winged and apparently sightless Eros led by a ﬁgure (perhaps Helios) carrying a torch and followed by a girl trying to cover Eros with a blue shawl. Four children, seeming trou-bled by the scene, look on. The title is displayed beneath the picture, which is dated July 1929 in the lower left corner. As far as can be determined, this is the ﬁrst painting—except for the portrait noted above—Archie created after her breakdown, although she had made several paintings of Eros some twenty-ﬁve to thirty years previously. Are they related to the lengthy poem The W anderings of Eros she began to write in 1903? She eventually wrote two versions of that tale, although it is not known when she completed the ﬁrst nor when she began the second version, which she ﬁnished in 1938. By fall 1931 Archie was ready to try a portrait in tem- pera, telling Marian May Clarke that it was the ﬁrst time she had used tempera for many years. 4 And by 1934, when she did a portrait of Bob Nicol, she was ready to use oils again, although she continued to do most of her portraits in conte pencil or pastels.

Her work thus made claims on her that neither she nor other mem-bers of the family could deny.

Sometime in 1931, probably in the spring or summer, she began writing biblical studies and expositions of Swedenborgian doctrine. Something “not of earth’s order” was in the making. “O ld heritages in the mind” had been awakened, and the result was a focus on spiritual concerns that were sufﬁciently compelling to Archie to dis-place self-expression through drama or poetry. As no record remains of speciﬁc occurrences that led Archie to feel that a new era had begun in her life, it is a mat-ter of conjecture what happened and when. Several observa-tions suggest a spiritual turning point in her life. In her 1946 application for a Guggenheim fellowship, she emphasized that after recovering from nervous prostration she “began to read Swedenborg for myself.” 8 This suggests that she devel- oped her own interpretations of Swedenborgian thought, perhaps contrasting with t hose she learned from her fat her as a young woman. Archie told Kingsley Ganson that she had a series of night- mares so troubling that she consulted with her minister about them. 9 Possibly personal study plus the dreams marked a new era in her life. Her shift in focus to Bible studies in 1931 sug-gest that the two events may be connected. By fall 1930 Archie had reestablished herself as an artist and had completed a number of ﬁne portraits.

Archie joined them in planning a required course on the history of civilization from a Swedenborgian perspec-tive, one that emphasized the ongoing involvement of God in creating circumstances through which humans could be won back to the divine plan of relatedness. Perhaps participation in planning the history course inspired Archie to undertake an exposition of Old T estament his-tory, based on her interpretation of Swedenborg’s commen-taries about the spiritual sense of the Bible story. She estab-lished a practice, which she continued for many years, of writing a few paragraphs every day and sending them to inter-ested people, who were asked to respond with comments. The ﬁrst study that Archie undertook in this fashion, “Comments on the Swedenborg Chart,” was begun in 1931 and continued until May 1934. The Swedenborg Chart depicts Swedenborg’s concept of spiritual eras described in the ﬁrst eleven chapters of Genesis in stories of the Garden of Eden to the T ower of Babel. As Archie expressed it, “History is a devolution with implications of a return, not an evolution as science has hith-erto used that term.” 10 The “Comments” begin with basic statements about God, divine love, and divine wisdom, and they continue with an interpretation of the Bible as the story of the spiritual wan-derings of humankind in general and of individuals past and present.

Archie describes the purpose of these Bible commentaries as being “to understand the source of man’s happiness and his sorrows.” 11 Occasional comments reﬂect Archie’s own experi- ence and describe her ways of coping with adversity. For exam-ple, in one of her letters she writes about the accumulation of anxieties and her conviction that the Divine utilizes the expe-rience for the individual’s spiritual growth: These despairs are gathered and grouped together by the Lord. They tower above the man. They lead him; and they catch him so that he cannot go to some different state of mind nor return to what he was. They are dark, but they have a light in them. Through them he hears things. When he tries to think, the things he hears in the cloud are before him. They are ineffable music, harmonies in the wrong he has done (though insisting on doing good) which he cannot think through, being too bright with mercy. When he tries to know his feeling, these towering despairs are behind him; and he hears their harmony against his wish to be despairing. 12 Archie considered the hells to be an ever-present counter- balance against the heavens, making it possible for individu- als to experience freedom because of the necessity to choose between good and evil. Thus life crises become purposeful, permitting an individual to envision right and good alterna-tives and to make wise choices. Archie repeatedly described reason, the capacity to think, as a gate between the natural (earthly) and spiritual minds. As she put it, “That wonderful gate . . . The gate is the rational . . . the opening door from the natural mind into possibilities of the spiritual . . . The spiri-tual in that Gate of the Rational invites the Natural up to the feast of love and worship, and tells it that it has one more step"

In contrast to the “Comments,” which are based on inspiration and the “recovery of other knowledges,” “Saul and David” is a meticulous “translation” of the literal words in the Bible into their Swedenborgian spir-itual sense, using the Dictionary of Correspondences prepared by students of Swedenborg as a guide to the spiritual meaning of each word of Bible narrative. Why did Archie choose the story of Saul and David for this laborious and meticulous undertaking? Saul and David are used by Swedenborg as symbols for spiritual states. Archie explains in the “Introduction to Saul and David”: The following studies . . . are for the purpose of assisting an adjustment between our thoughts and feelings and our bodies or our dominating external physical existence. It is certain that we wish all to be following our thoughts and feelings, having with us innately the conviction of a secret anointing there that has a right to control us, and, likewise, it is certain that we are all held to the external facts of life by a power which we would shake off. The poignant universal moment of this condition is contained remarkably, as shown to Emanuel Swedenborg, in the story of Saul and David. Saul is the external condition, David the secretly anointed life. And let it be accepted at once that God cannot be left out of this psychology. 14 It seems clear that Archie devoted so much time and atten- tion to “Saul and David” because she wanted to understand the process of moving away from the natural life, as represented by Saul, and toward the spiritual life, symbolized by David."

And this tremendous process is underway when the swelling of something new—a Presence—has left the polished beauty of the nutshell of our world and had reached the interiors of it; when the Lord has departed from Saul. 15 These brief selections from the vast wealth of the “Saul and David” manuscript show that Archie experienced a per- sonal spiritual adventure and pondered its power to transform life so that familiar activities and family relationships could never again seem to be the same. She knew that it was difﬁ-cult for others to understand and wiser that she not “proclaim the vision which inwardly has blessed us.” 16 Family and friends sensed a change in Archie’s perspective and a radical alteration in her self-concept. Her nieces report that she seemed to “live in another world,” aloof from many concerns of daily life. 17 Increased emphasis on the spiritual may be interpreted as a coping strategy for Archie, for it provided her with an external authority and reasons for trusting Sewall family expectations. Looking back over the fourteen years since Archie’s return to Urbana from Washington, the decade of her ﬁfties, it seems evident that she was developing more freedom to express her individuality. Without her father as a spiritual mentor, she was on her own and she had to develop her own undergird-ing psychic structure.

The issues involved in the plays written during the period between 1917 and 1930 aid in understanding Archie’s personal process. An afﬁrmation of the importance of the spiritual aspects of life runs throughout the series, beginning with the soldiers who leave behind their childish Sunday school faith in Christmas Eve (1917). The Barn of Bethlehem (1920) afﬁrms the realty of Jesus for those who are willing to receive him. Clouds (1924) emphasizes the attempt of the Divine to clear away “fogs of mind” to make it possible to recognize divine involve-ment in everyday family life. The pageants of 1922, 1923, and 1924 are based on the par- ticularly Swedenborgian concept of distinct levels (discrete degrees) in the structure of the physical and spiritual worlds as well as in our own psyche. The three interwoven levels of his-tory, symbolic action, and vision emphasize the Divine at work through the thought and action of individuals as they make history through everyday events. But sometimes there must be cataclysmic change. The Rising depicts an old order, both per- sonal and social, that must be swept away, despite some good and appealing characteristics, to make room for change. The complexities of being yoked to another individual make marriage a particularly difﬁcult arena for change, and Archie’s plays wrestle with the problem from the perspective of a wife. In The Conquest (1914) the wife l earns to respect her husband’s reasons for actions that are contrary to her expectations. But Kate in Goodness Knows (1925) acts on her own convictions, being certain that she knows best. Although Kate gets into hot water, the play emphasizes marriage as a strong and trusting relationship, able to ride out complications. The wife’s individ-uality is expressed even more strongly in Love Immortal (1928), where objections are raised to conventional homemaking and"

The plays, viewed as preparations for Archie’s later con- centration on spiritual issues, progress from a statement that adult spiritual reality is different from that of a child, through the recognition of the inevitability of change and the pos-sibility of divine companionship in the process, to explora-tion of a wife’s rights as an individual. In terms of the issues with which Archie had engaged, the stage was set to move to a more overtly spiritual plane. The Swede nborg Charts and her “Comments” on them outline a process of spiritual devel-opment in terms of a personal loss of closeness to the Divine, the resulting spiritual decadence, and God’s repeated outreach through the divine humanity of Jesus. She spells out the pro-cess in detail using “Saul and David,” through the recogni-tion of the necessity of shaking off the “external facts of life” as one recognizes the reality of the spiritual realm and begins to envision another way of life. Archie’s ability to depict spiri-tual growth in moving detail leads to the possibility that she drew on her own experience in coming to terms with separat-ing from her father and recognizing that she was on her own in relation to her Maker."

She deplored the absence of artistic attention to depicting the human body as a reﬂection of the Divine. In a lecture on modern art, she commented: The loss of this sociable servant to the world, Fine Art, is patently tested by the things it no longer does for us. First of all, the human smile. In what art is it seen today? It used to be seen all ove r the face of the earth in its earliest reports of the faces of men: smiles that beamed as much from forehead as from mouth and lay like sunshine in form itself without the wrinkle of a lip or cheek. It comforted where it was looked at. It seemed to be God . . . Next to the smile we may note the loss of varieties of affection and understanding, the play of thought and love on the face. 1 From 1928 until 1938 Archie concentrated on portraits, often asking family members or friends to pose for her. Many were willing, and even ﬂattered, to do so and agreed to have their portraits exhibited in order to help Archie attract com-missions. She selected frames for these portraits, usually paid for by the subject, who paid whatever was possible for the por-trait itself. Archie took pains in arranging the composition of her por- traits.

Some feel that Archie idealized her subjects, overemphasizing the angelic aspects of their personalities. Through portraits, Archie could depict the expression of the spiritual she saw in her subjects and thus release more of that spiritual element into the natural world.

In practical terms, Archie was good at doing portraits and people were willing to pay for them, which generated much-needed money. Bob Nicol, who was a student in her college art classes, appraises her early portraits—especially those done in 1929 of her husband and his sister Margaret—as excellent drawing, noting that later she used pastels and became “almost careless” about drawing. As Nicol comments, “She got more into color as she went along, probably as a reaction to the hor-ror of her life.” 6 As instructor of art at Urbana Junior College between 1930 and 1934, Archie taught drawing by having her student depict Louise Orth with her children.

Some casts were ordered of various Greek sculptures—a full-size head of Praxiteles’ Hermes and one of Minerva, a small full-length of the same Hermes, and one of Michelangelo’s Slave, plus a Nike. . . . The drawing was done entirely with the point (either in black conte crayon, the more usual, or charcoal stick) and only in vertical lines, the varying weight of which alone conveyed value . . . The purpose of this was to develop sensitivity of touch and coordination of eye and hand. It is an old technique, and she used it herself with the portraits she did at that time although she dispensed with the discipline unnecessary to her of the perfectly straight lines, and used rubbed tones as well. Mrs. James was totally exacting as a teacher just as she was in her own work. Drawing had to be accurate and every subtle value had to be expressed, the whole blending together with no small area being allowed to ‘jump out.’ Implicit in all this of course was the art of ‘seeing,’ not only with regard to the subtleties of light and shade but what was conveyed by them of spiritual values inherent in the original sculpture, which she emphasized constantly by comments on Greek and Swedenborgian philosophy . . .

And so the careful scrutiny and drawing of the casts, enforced as it was by informal lectures on the intellectuality of the eye and the power of ultimates with insights into the carefully reasoned aspects of Greek art and architecture with the aid of many photos. The casts were moved about to show the effects of the play of varying light on the surfaces, and one always had to bear in mind the personalities and correspondences of Hermes et al. and wherein these were revealed by the sculptor. It was quite an education, I must say, and thoroughly unique. 7 Only serious art students would be willing to spend a year, much less two years, drawing plaster casts, even if the classes were spiced with lectures and visual aids. But there were such students in Urbana, some of whom continued to study with Archie for many years. As Nicol emphasizes, there was more than technique involved in Archie’s teaching. She espoused a system, a philosophy, that transcended the act of drawing and included both the personal experience of seeing and the spir-itual signiﬁcance of the object depicted. Thus students were taught a spiritual-intellectual aesthetic that requires genuine thought and feeling as well as technical skill. Archie expected her students to demonstrate their comprehension of the spiri-tual basis of art, and formulated examination questions for her Spiritual Life of Art class in a form that echoed the catechism to drive the theory home.

Nicol studied painting full-time for two years and provides more insight into Archie’s approach to art: [Mrs. James’s] philosophies of art got a good airing during this period. Some of them are more or less intrinsic and therefore difﬁcult to explain. For example she went to some lengths to explain, with the aid of photographs, generally, what constituted the difference between sentimentality and genuineness in art, the gradations of expressed feeling, etc. She had a kind of scale of values in that regard, based entirely on Swedenborg. Y ou could say in ﬁne that the relative greatness (or futility) of a given painting or work of art (any art) depended on the quality of the emotion it expresses. Religious art was the Highest Use to which painting could be put, but here the genuineness of the emotion was the most difﬁcult to express. She greatly admired Fra Angelico and many of the earlier pre-Renaissance painters like Giotto and Cimabue. Raphael she admired and had me study his compositions, but she felt that the later masters were often led astray by their own great skill, and lost, or I should say frequently lost, t hat ear ly purity of feeling. Rembrandt made it right up near the top someplace, but you can see that Rubens, although she rhapsodized about his techniques, wouldn’t come too high on the ultimate scale of values. I’m just throwing in a few random samples to try to give you an idea of how she thought. She classiﬁed not only artists but whole ages and eras of art in this manner. In fact it is possibly a lot easier to apply such standards to the expressions of a school or an era than to an individual, and probably a lot more valid.

The various categories of painting also came under this scale: religious art, as I have said, was the highest expressions, then genre and portraiture, which embody the human factor; then landscape and still life. But of course the qualities of dignity, nobility of outlook, quality and excellence of execution could enter into all of these things and raise them to a high level. Abstracts were not considered, and Impressionism did not seem to impress her. 8 Nicol’s description of Archie’s philosophy of art shows that she had worked out a very speciﬁc and intellectual approach to drawing and painting. Although she found it impossible to practice her craft for the long period when her eyes were in poor condition (from 1905 to 1928), she must have been reading and thinking, forging a rationale for the discipline she would take up again. She may have lacked a formal edu-cation, but she had learned well how to question, to formu- late thoughts, to build a systematic philosophy. There is no doubt that Howard Helmick and Frank Sewall contributed to Archie’s philosophical position, but in order to teach with such a profound impact that it remained clear to her students ﬁfty years later, Archie must have imposed her own order on input gathered from other sources. The long years of struggle for health and the capacity to work had borne fruit. Archie’s teaching extended beyond drawing and painting. At Urbana Junior College she taught ancient Greek drama. In addition, she offered doctrinal classes to the Swedenborgian students at the college. She prepared carefully for her classes and developed diagrams and charts to aid students’ under-standing."

However when she got into the speciﬁcs of personal conduct, particularly in relation to conjugal love, the general reception was somewhat qualiﬁed. Mrs. James had no conception of the truth that . . . there are no absolutes, and her approach here was uncompromisingly idealistic.

It was non-sectarian, broad enough in orientation to include Catholics, Protestants of various denominations, and Amish, in addition to Swedenborgians. The Urbana Movement operated a school that was open to anyone who wanted to learn, requiring only that the pupil not have a negative attitude toward the “work and spirit of the Movement.” 2 In November 1933 Archie drafted a “Statement of the Urbana Movement” explaining its origins: “In an impulse to liberate the thoughts and feelings of youth from the insinceri-ties of a worldly education by demonstrating the effectiveness of a continual remembrance of the Lord, as He is shown in the Writings of the New Church, and by providing a systematic and orderly freedom for giving and receiving of mental and technical instruction.” 3 The Statement juxtaposes the spiritual and the practical.

The Statement proposes that the Movement take shape slowly and represent what Archie took to be “the Real, the Inner Urbana University”: The curriculum, therefore, and the groups or classes, will form themselves from need outward, not as in other institutions, from theories inward. What is wished to be learned will be wished to be taught, and, as both wishes are from the L ord, the teaching a nd the learning will cohere in groups or bodies of more or less order; a system, or curriculum, growing out of the innate activity of the idea . . . Thus, from the thoughts and feelings may come a form that will take shape as a mental satisfaction to the world. In addition to explaining the origins and principles of the Movement, the Statement served as a formal notice of its orga- nization: “Being then a corporate body it can retain Inﬂux;4 can meet and answer questions and withstand disintegration, and can extend a certain kind of protection to other faint and spiritual beginnings of mind and h eart whereve r shown.” The Movement had ofﬁcers: a president (Archie), vice pres- ident, and secretary.

In its ﬁrst semester, fall 1933, the courses included drawing, painting, composition, modeling, por traiture, the interpretation of history, construction of the Greek drama, appreciation of art through the Greek myths, and the doctrine of the discrete degrees, all “taught from the interior reality of life to the exterior expression . . .

While He has before been present in the shaping of all blessed inventions, in the carving of the wooden blocks for Caxton’s printing press, in the compressing of steam into Newton’s boiler engine, in the ﬁtting of stopped pipes into Cathedral organs, and most surely in the tender colors and noble forms of every great age of art, His presence has been as an efﬂuence of hope, or beauty, a mysterious providence preferably kept mystical, even worshiped apart from the mind, as a Divine miracle perhaps, but kept in the sphere of the irrational in order that the works might do what seemed natural with a thing they considered their own. If He has been present in the workshop or on the organ bench it has been as the Inspirer not as the T echnician. From lack of systematic knowledge of His apparatus in the human mind this purely emotional, or evasively theoretic, relation with Him has obtained. 8 An indication of the importance of the Urbana Movement to its students is given if one imagines them on a hot June day, sitting on wooden folding chairs through a lengthy address, attentive to the vision of its founder and president as she went on to discuss two dangers that threatened the Movement: the mistrusting attitudes of “friends, neighbors and families,” and resulting tendency to prove and justify rather than to trust the Lord and go forward. She noted that even people who claimed to agree with the idea of the Movement were prone to argue that “the Lord does not wish us to take Him literally in such practical matters of this Natural Plane where we must live.” 9 T o Archie the answer to such misleading reactions was prayer, an active resting of the mind with the divine source of its wellsprings.

These words do not interfere with other thoughts; rather they prevent a wandering mind and induce ideas, and protect from waste emotions. Perhaps the Prayer has never been used in just this way before. Surely as things stand today, it is time to do something that has never been done before. The Lord’s Prayer, we are told by Swedenborg, is the most powerful instrument on earth, connecting through all the heavens of thinking and the heavens of feeling with the bosom of the Lord Himself, the Divine Human Being who knows what we are after in the place where we are. It is so constructed that its immensity of help covers every minutest detail of intention of the asker. Good ﬂows through it unavoidably, and because it has been so universally said, and is still so said, it holds families, nations, humanity, t he very fabric of the earth in some kind of shape against a constantly impending ruin. By the search-light of its short sentences we are kept in sight of ourselves as belonging to others, and by the heat of its imploring we are kept in the warm blood of the Inﬂowing Lord. We are constantly thus being re-created. We recognize those things we are provided to do, we think of those means and causes for things yet to be done, and we stop in fear and terror before the things we must not do.

As a child and young woman she had lived within a spiritual discipline created by her parents. She was the daughter of a clergyman who was dedicated to identifying and carrying out the requirements of a Swedenborgian religious dispensation at home, in the family circle, and in his everyday life, as well as in his pro-fessional ministerial capacity. Archie read Swedenborg daily with him for many years. Frank Sewall tutored his daughter in Swedenborgian concepts of the links between the celestial, spiritual, and natural planes, and the ﬂow of love and truth from the inside out, from God the Divine to the individual human. Having l earned to live these principles, and tre asuring them as guides for the rational planning of everyday affairs, it is not surprising that Archie reafﬁrmed their importance in her own life by creating an organization based upon them.

Archie’s practice of constant prayer may have evolved as a means of coping with years of illness and disability. Archie must have struggled with bouts of deep discouragement and had to develop techniques for combating feelings of inepti-tude and defeat. The inscription she chose for her tombstone, “Thy will be done,” reﬂects not only her dedication to ﬁnd-ing and following a divine path but also a sense that prayer was the means by which she sought guidance. The conclud-ing paragraph of her ﬁrst annual address as president of the Movement expresses her views of the pathway between the person and the Divine: Let us take note that this Movement is not from us to the Lord. It is from the Lord to us and back again to Him. It may pass by us. It is that broad pure river of life, clear as crystal proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.

The Movement is . . . to be a provision for systematic and orderly freedom in mental things. It is free, and it will be free, to change as the mind changes in spiritual expansion, always watchful and accumulative of knowledges, always ahead of our desire, always modern, always new. 12 Archie was transported, lifted out of the complexities of daily life in the James household, for the Movement repre- sented a kind of guarantee that what she did and thought was right and blessed. She worked hard on her painting and writ-ing and teaching, maintaining a demanding schedule and rev-eling in it. Although her husband objected to the demands the Move- ment placed on the household, that did not deter Archie, who was buoyed by the fact that the pupils kept coming. She had found a way to associate with like-minded people who were dedicated to spiritual goals, and every sign reassured her that she was on the right path. In 1932, the Reverend Russell Eaton (Archie’s brother-in- law and a former resident of the James house at 300 High Street) became the president of Urbana Junior College. Archie continued as art instructor, although she felt that Russell did not foster the spiritual mission of the college. She wrote to Franklin and Carolyn Blackmer, “When I pleaded the spiritual ideas as still existing, [Russell] said, ‘The College is not a men-tal thing nor a vessel for a spiritual thing. It is a Junior College. My part is to get it accredited.’ I have been sick from that.” 13 Despite her husband’s advice to keep her hands off the col- lege, Archie decided she could “work for what Mr. J really wants and disregard what he apparently wants.” 14 She con- cluded that the Divine was wor king to provide an “earthly vessel . . . for a new Chance”15 through the Urbana Movement."

      "text": "182 Stay by Me, RosesFrom the beginning, the Urbana Movement was connected with the idea of Urbana University. Archie envisioned it as carrying on the spiritual essence of the institution as her father had deﬁned it when he served as president of the col-lege many years before. She felt that the Movement, which emphasized doing things for the right reasons and turning to the Divine for guidance to hold to the right path, was doing important work in the world on behalf of the college. The “Art Prospectus” of the Movement, prepared in fall 1933,16 includes a syllabus for six years of instruction in art and mentions that fees are payable to Urbana Junior College for the ﬁrst two years of classes in drawing. For the remaining four years of instruction in painting and composition, in mod-eling and portraits, students would pay on a voluntary basis consistent with the principles of the Movement. The origi-nal plan appears to have been that Archie would continue to offer drawing classes at the college, but offer advanced classes solely under the jurisdiction of the Movement. Wherever she taught the instruction was based on the approach described in the prospectus: “Instruction begins for all students each year in turning their thought toward the Lord by the doctrines of the New Church. Diagrams and deﬁnitions of the action of the spiritual world into the structure of the mind are continued for all in brief talks. The sense of the necessity of living with the Lord in order to see justly and use happily one’s ability gradually permeates all effort. Repose of mind and a freedom of expression follow, towards beauty, service and worship.” 17 When Russell Eaton became president of the college he was determined to continue progress toward accreditation and wanted every aspect of the program conducted in proper aca-demic form. He maintained that any courses offered in con-nection with the college should be under its jurisdiction, which would preclude sponsorship by the Urbana Movement.

Disagreements between Russell and Archie intensiﬁed dur- ing late spring and summer 1934, culminating in her with-drawal as art instructor at the college and Russell’s dictum that she must not set foot on college property nor hold classes at Lyceum Hall. Archie felt that holding classes elsewhere was tantamount to the destruction of the Movement, but she did not want to involve to members of the Movement in a con-ﬂict that had overtones of a family quarrel. At ﬁrst she chose to deal with the situation by prayer, feeling sure that she had been guided by the Divine and that the Urbana Movement was the answer to the needs of the times. Later, she enlisted the aid of some Swedenborgian members of the Movement in an effort to convince church ofﬁcials that the college faced an uncertain future if it was separated from its essential spiritual core. But her protests fell on deaf ears. T o Russell, the spiritual authority claimed by the Urbana Move ment must have seemed like a disguise for Archie’s enthu siasm-of-the-moment. As her brother-in-law, he had watched her projects wax and wane over the years and prob-ably adopted the James family interpretation that Archie had insisted on her own way since she was a child and, as a consequence, had neve r learned t he give and take of practi- cal realities. 18 Archie saw the situation in different terms. She had brought into being an organization intended to further the proper spiritual interests of the college and it was off to a promis-ing start; but in her view that made it particularly vulnerable to the attempt of the hells to overcome the work of God that she had set in motion.

At about the same time, John James suffered ﬁnancial reverses. He had, according to one family member, “invested heavily in a revolutionary way to extract gasoline from oil, or a new reﬁning technique. The process was always spoken of as workable and even remarkable but for reasons unknown to me it was not a ﬁnancial success.” 21 Faced with his own problems plus a family convinced that his wife had lost her sanity, in the summer of 1934 John decided to take his wife and son away from Urbana to the family home on Lake Erie. After a few weeks of desolation, Archie devised a plan to visit her goddaughter in Detroit, hoping to ﬁnd work there. T o her surprise, her husband agreed that she should go. She wrote: I suggested that I take my box of photographs of students’ work and my own, and go to Detroit where I have a dear friend who believes in all I do, 22 and see what can be done in getting portraits to do and pupils to teach. There was no objection raised to the plan! I had been strangely led to have the photos sent me, why I did not know, and to write to Mrs. Campbell asking if she could receive me. There were many possibilities that she could not, and I was glad, as these would be evidences of the Lord’s will.

After a brief stay with Elise Campbell, her goddaughter and a teacher at the Merrill-Palmer School, she took a room in a boarding house and set up a studio in a building owned by the Merrill-Palmer School. By November 8 she wrote to Bob Nicol, “The Urbana Movement School opens Saturday at 2 p.m. No funds, no casts, just a room! Praise the LORD!” 24 Archie borrowed casts from the museum, and by December reported: “My tiny studio is humming—the students eager and industrious on the 3 afternoons I give to teaching, and portrait sitters crowding the Greek casts on the days I am free to have them. I am PAYING MY OWN WAY! And going home for Xmas on MY OWN MONEY! Eleven portraits either on"

An art dealer urged her to use an agent and charge set fees for her portraits, but when work-ing on the ﬁrst commission arranged by the agent, she wrote to Bob Nicol: “It somehow doesn’t sound like the Movement, which is a very gentle thing, and I believe I’m off the track—LORD help me . . . In any light I’m becoming well known and the Movement is an open issue, either disturbing or delighted in. It is such a very sensitive thing. And woe to me if I lose it for the world or weaken its strong pure tide.” 26 So Archie gave up the agent and returned to the preferred scheme of having people pay what they felt they should. She had a card printed which read, Portraits by Mrs. James are made with the hope of stimulating a desire to possess works of art among those who have little or no money, as well as among those who have more. In order to keep this movement general no ﬁxed price is asked, but no sum over $150 will be accepted whether for life size groups or small single heads.

The foothold of falsity is ﬂoating away from all of them . . .

Some BODY ﬁghting for a poor lost sheep?” 30 Y ears later, in writing to Elise Campbell, Archie referred to the year in Detroit as “the winter of my discontent.” But the evidence of Archie’s sanity, plainly to be seen by the doubt-ers back in Urbana, was her ability to support herself by teach-ing and doing portraits. The Movement provided the sense that she was functioning on behalf of a signiﬁcant cause, big-ger than herself, doing God’s work. Her sense of drama was engaged by the feeling of danger; but the danger did not seem overwhelming because the Divine provided the answers. When she had successfully carried off the winter in Detroit she explained to Bob Nicol: It will not seem as protagonist to you to say that this Movement is the only safety in the world today . . . There are peculiar things connected with the Movement and you might as well come upon them through someone else’s experience to ease your own. Y ou will always feel in danger.

He had agreed to her plan to go to Detroit. Did he believe in Archie? How was he coping with his ﬁnancial problems? One of Archie’s letters from fall 1934 reports: “Mr. James has been brought to a ﬁnancial situation that is ominous indeed . . . The friend who betrayed him is now eking out his last money on a Note at the Bank.” 32 One might expect a husband and wife to want to be together in a time of shared disasters, and at one time Archie antici-pated that her husband might come to Detroit. Later she com-mented, “Mr. James is trying to close up his affairs in order to go somewhere else! They do not seem to get closed—I wonder why.” 33 After her brief trip to Urbana at Christmastime, Archie set out to devise a scheme to see her husband. In March she wrote to a friend living in northern Ohio, Louise Orth, who gives this account: Mrs. James wrote to me, explaining that she was in Detroit, painting portraits to make enough money to send David to college, buy him the car he wanted, etc. Because John didn’t have money and no one else thought it necessary.

I was to pay for materials and framing and so that is how I happen to have the portrait. As it happened John wouldn’t stay but about 3 days—then went to Marblehead where the family had a cottage—and returned just before she was to go back to Detroit. 34 As it turned out, having Archie and John come to visit was no easy proposition. At the time, the Orths, with two children and Louise Orth’s mother, lived in a small three-bedroom house on a Depression-era budget. Archie sent her dietary list: a quarter-pound of butter a day, lamb chops, T-bone steaks, and pure, rich cream to “coat her nerves.” When she arrived she commandeered the Orths’ bedroom so she and John could share a double bed, then chose the room to which the Orths moved as the only place with suitable light for portrait paint-ing.

No doubt Archie had been lonesome, but possibly part of her personal agenda at the time was to reafﬁrm the relationship with her husband after its disruption by her reaction to losing Lyceum Hall as a center for the Urbana Movement. John James might have been expected to look after his wife’s interests more vigorously, despite his own problems. Probably dealing with contention within the family was as difﬁcult for him as pleading a case in court. Archie may have felt she needed to reassure him that he was forgiven for letting the Movement (i.e., her) down. At the end of the visit with the Orths, he accompanied her back to Detroit and then returned to Urbana. People were apt to assume that the James house in Urbana belonged to the only son, John. In fact, however, John and each of his sisters had each inherited an equal share of the family property at 300 High Street in Urbana. By 1934 two of the sisters had died and the widower of one of them had mar-ried another sister, thus reducing the number of sharehold-ers. The resolution of John’s ﬁnancial problems was an agree-ment with his sister Margaret that, in exchange for his interest in the family homestead, she would support him and Archie. Margaret also had some other resources, the result of success-ful investment of money inherited from her grandfather, so she was able to agree to provide for her brother and his wife. Thus Margaret, already the manager of the house, moved a step closer to becoming its sole owner.

During this period she was also teaching and writing. Most of the time she lived and worked in Urbana, but there were times—such as her time in Detroit (1934–1935) and a year when she taught at Chapel Hill School in Waltham, Massachusetts, (1942–1943)—when she was away from Urbana for months at a time. She made shorter trips to California, Colorado, and Massachusetts to visit family or friends and do portraits. Having overcome her health problems, Archie guarded her well-being by a strict regimen of work, exercise, diet, and rest. The result was impressive productivity. During this twenty-year period late in her life she completed at least sixty-six portraits, ﬁfteen major oil paintings, two murals on church walls, and sketches and designs for several competitions. In addition, she wrote three lengthy manuscripts and kept up a demanding program of study and teaching. The daily schedule varied from time to time, depend- ing on what projects were uppermost, and also on whether Margaret was in Urbana to run the household. A glimpse of Archie’s schedule in fall 1936 shows: “ At 5:30 I run to the kitchen. No cook. No money to get one. Classes downtown and here.

She is said to have been a speedy typist on a portable she used daily for many years. Archie herself was astonished at how much she accom- plished, and explained it in part by the balance she maintained between different activities, and in part because of the effect on her mind and energies of reading Swedenborg. Referring to a hiatus in the daily page of doctrinal commentary she had been sending to Bob Nicol, she wrote: I found that in a page or two I would be at the necessity of beginning the subject of Divine Providence (DP) and was quite appalled with my unprepared mind for the study; so decided to take the time which I put into your letter to read again the DP 3 . . . As soon as I got started on the reading, my work on “Eros” let up, while the stenographer copied the last Cantos; so then, to cure my literariness, I plunged with keen appetite into pictures. I decided to give a little sale of my own work here at my house, using the friendly ofﬁces of some Springﬁeld ladies to bring me a patronage . . . I have 15 little pastels under way . . . School under way, Eros still requiring some work—and it seemed to me at ﬁrst that I was undertaking a fearful amount—but you know a strange thing happened. As soon as I began to read 13 pages a day of DP I began to have more time! Everything works round at the right moment in perfect ease and contentment, and slews of work is done—I have plenty of models; and seem to have no end of strength; as for ideas and compositions! If I could paint all day and night they would never be done. They just form out in beauty, sweetness and freshness. How can the LORD be so good to an old woman! 4 At sixty-seven Archie may have considered herself old, but she still had plenty of energy and an endless supply of ideas."

Sometimes he, like the rest of the James family, was inﬂuenced by his brother-in-law, Russell Eaton, who was openly scorn-ful of Archie and her projects. It is sometimes said that a sup-portive husband is one of the keystones that enable a woman to achieve. John appreciated his wife’s painting and considered her an excellent poet. No doubt he treasured her understand-ing and concern about his own projects, but for the most part she was on her own, dependent on such reassurance as she received from her students, sisters, and friends, and her sense of a close bond with the Divine. Once in a while she men-tioned the difﬁculties at home in her letters: The other great question to me here, the family order in our own house, for which I have suffered terribly this last year to bring into shape—here too were storms of doubt in my mind, as to whether to give up—whether this were not the life I must relinquish—when, on the page of the open Word in the Church shone out these words to Daniel, “Blessed is he that waiteth. Go thy way!”—Oh Robert, what that meant. How kind the LORD is! How can He have pity and attention for such a little thing! Surely He will protect us; He guides even the amount of gruel glue I put in my pastels—and I ﬁnd, when I have forgotten to follow the prescribed order I followed a better and unconscious one. 5 Archie did not automatically assume that she should remain with her husband. The year in Detroit had shown her that she could manage on her own. But she considered marriage a per-manent bond and probably, after thirty-ﬁve years, was used to deﬁning herself as a member of the James family. Through prayer, she coped with the difﬁculties she encountered. She turned to the Bible as a source of guidance; she believed in opening it at random, expecting to ﬁnd a verse to give her"

Various events seemed to her like signals from the Divine, providing a sense of support and of the value of her endeavors. How does it happen that the productive years did not begin sooner? Why did Archie wait until she was ﬁfty-eight to resume her work as a painter? As a poet and playwright she was in touch with her creative potential, yet she was in low gear prior to 1928 compared to the energy available to her after she began to paint again. The recovery of her vision was signiﬁcant, but does not adequately explain the dramatic increase in her energy and output. Probably a conﬂuence of events helped to reshape Archie’s self-image so that she saw herself as a person who could and wanted to be an artist again. Her mother died in 1924, thus making it difﬁcult to escape the realization that she had become the elder generation and that a limited number of years remained to accomplish her life objectives. Her son David returned to Urbana, ending the years of enforced sep-aration. Perhaps the passage of years or something that hap-pened in the relationship with her husband reassured her that it would now be safe to outperform him. Her plays indicate that her focus on the spiritual dimensions of life had become more explicit, perhaps providing a rationale for self-expression that could not be denied. So Archie was able to sustain amazing productivity, to envi- sion grand schemes and demanding projects, and to wrestle with the complications she encountered until she was well into her eighties. She had a strong and speciﬁc sense of purpose and scheduled her days to accomplish what she set out to do. Her attitude toward time is expressed in the sonnet “T o Time”: Thou ineffectual, ever-failing thing; Immortal, yet disowned by the Soul. How dost thou nag and fret and warp and sting!"

Gradually hunger for understanding them trickled down into his intelligence.7 Archie asked Mrs. Campbell, a psychologist, for advice about helping John learn to spell. John had gone on to college with- out conquering spelling and Archie continued to feel respon- sible for his development. Her letter continues, Now my whole concern is to get him educated, to continue the opening use of his beautiful mind . . . He cannot spell because of the ten years silence and no reading the ﬁrst of his life. I have suggested, and he has followed, every plan possible. Sometimes it’s all right—then suddenly it’s all gone—I suppose when he’s in a hurry. Next year he will have more English and that will help, maybe! What do you suggest? This kind of spelling will handicap him all his life. 8 Archie helped John Cavanaugh in other ways. She arranged for him to live near her home with a woman who took in a few boarders; she persuaded a cousin to contribute money toward his expenses at Ohio State University; she wrote letters of advice to him about points of etiquette such as behavior in restaurants and welcoming friends to his room. As John Cavanaugh recounts the years he spent as Archie’s student (1937–42), it becomes clear how much energy she devoted to his development. 9 He participated in the Urbana Movement classes but he also read with her for three hours a day. In order to help him l earn the E nglish language, Archie arranged a program in which he would read aloud with her: an hour of Swedenborg from 7:00 to 8:00 in the morning; an hour of the Harvard Classics (Plato, etc.) at noon; and an hour of Shakespeare, Greek tragedies, or the letters of Sir Thomas More at night.

A fter the early morning reading, John did apprentice chores such as grinding paints, preparing her palette, and mixing waxwood. At the end of the day, he washed and shaped her brushes, sometimes as many as twenty. Summer days sometimes included four- to ﬁve-hour midday hikes, taking a picnic to the countryside and reading and painting there. Had she been another person, Archie might have been con- tent to have John enroll in the Urbana Movement classes and absorb what he could. But she was too concerned and involved a person to do that. Here was a challenge—to develop a mind, to shape the soul of an artist—and her response was to broaden his horizons by plunging him into great ideas and beautiful language, trusting that his curiosity would be piqued and his sense of possibilities awakened. Her program provided John with a breadth of perspective that would have been dif-ﬁcult to attain if his desperate mother had not sought out the artist in Urbana. For Archie was more than a teacher of art; she was a teacher of skills for living a thoughtful and disci-plined life. She wanted to share what she had learned from her father with a promising young artist. By late 1937 Archie was beginning to envision oil paintings she wanted to do, mostly on religious themes, which she con-sidered the highest use of art. In January 1938 she reported to Bob Nicol that she had begun three large oils, includ-ing Apollo with a lyre and “a lovely appealing black-eyed lit-tle dark Virgin against heavy trees with the Child and one or two other children.” 10 A month later Archie reported that thunderclouds had seemed appropriate for the latter paint-ing, which had come to represent the text, “He shall give his angels charge over thee.” She continued, “It seems to mean the woman with the manchild preserved in the wilderness as much as the Incarnation. It seems all right to have the mean-"

Did Archie see a connection between the thunderclouds which worked their way into the picture and the situation in her own life? Her letter concludes, “We are all well. I have been through some storms—perhaps am in the midst of one now—but He is in the ship—or coming on the water—so all will be well. Of course I am working hard.” 12 No doubt hard work helped in weathering the storm, whatever its nature may have been. Her letter exempliﬁes the way Archie’s painting expresses aspects of her own life, sometimes representing per-sonal upheavals or incorporating a reassuring sense that the Divine is involved and has assigned angels to protect a woman caught in a storm. By June 1938 Archie had almost completed four large oil paintings, which she hoped to sell in order to ﬁnance a trip to Europe with two of her sisters. She took two of the paint-ings to a New Y ork dealer but, although she reduced the prices to $500, they did not sell because, the dealer told her, they needed a different audience. 13 Archie decided that she really did not want to sell The Madonna of the Storms , which she pre- ferred to place where John could see it, on the bookshelves in his study. Archie did not seem to feel defeated when her pictures did not sell, for her pleasure was in the experience of painting. Writing to Bob Nicol and his wife, who had sent a photograph from Italy, she said: The photograph of Tiepolo’s great ceiling of beauty and love is before me much of the time, teasing me by its perfection to leave all else that I am doing and paint, to the end of my days.

They are only hints now—partly due to the cramped, and all but impossible arrangements of my one north light. However difﬁculties have usually improved art—and if as yet it has not so helped mine, the fault is with me. 14 One difﬁculty that perpetually plagued Archie was the cost of materials. Her former student, Bob Nicol, gave her some paints and pastels and shared his experiments in making pastel crayons so that she could make her own. She solved the prob-lem of procuring paints by grinding her own colors or, when possible, assigning the task to apprentices like John Cavanaugh. The problem of frames was more complex. Often her vision of a painting included a sculptured frame. She experi-mented with a compound of beeswax (obtained from one of her pupils) and sawdust gathered from the manual arts classes at the high school. The resulting “waxwood,” used for her own frames and those of her pupils, cost nothing and could be sculptured and mixed with color to create a frame suited to each picture. The ﬁrst painting to be framed in waxwood was a recently completed Eros depicting the god in the act of shooting an arrow. Archie worked on two other paintings, one featuring Apollo and the other titled Grape Children, for at least two more years, and began other oil paintings as well. Her letters often men-tion the regularity of her endeavors: “painting pretty steadily.” 15 Painting was a release as well as a means of expression. It gave her a chance to translate the inner spiritual messages she val-ued into tangible terms that could be received by others. It kept her engrossed in something objective, something beyond"

For technical advice about painting Archie turned to Max Doerner, a professor at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich, whose book The Materials of the Artist and Their Use in Painting with Notes on the T echniques of the Old Masters was published in English translation in 1934. From reading Doerner, Archie got ideas that resulted in changes in her technique with oils. In a critical vein she wrote to Bob Nicol: I am ﬁnding that sensitiveness to change, while being the necessary needle-point of new life, brings a preliminary depletion with it. At least that is how I translate all my use of Doerner. I am just beginning to proﬁt by the operation. I look at the Apollo I painted under his drastic examination and ﬁnd it too horrible to keep my eyes on it. I was out of my old and not into my new. Things are going better now. Beauty, my own beauty, is coming up out of the applications of laws that were foreign to me. 16 As she got further into work with oils Archie’s longing for a studio increased. Finally, late in 1939, a studio was located for the Urbana Movement classes. When classes were not in session it was available for Archie’s personal use. She wrote to Bob Nicol, “having a studio for the ﬁrst time in years, I have been painting every day, in a famished way because of the approaching interruptions of School . . . My happiness grows constantly.” 17 First and foremost, she remained dedicated to her art. Describing a discussion with a man who considered it impos-sible to “build a living on beautiful art,” Archie commented, I told him that our business was to perfect our beauty and our technique and to be diligent in BELIEVING"

That endeavor did not result in a commis-sion, but it activated her interest in murals. Then, as the coun-try geared up for World War II, there came a request for pic-tures to inspire patriotism. The program had no appeal for Archie until she recognized it as an opportunity to commu-nicate spiritual messages.

They can’t help but get the idea, and who can stop that working!19 Cavanaugh recalls, “Mrs. James was producing a great deal during the years that I was with her, 1937 to ’42. The biggest thing that I l earned from her was work habits that are very regular. One must stop working, no matter how exciting and well you are working, at a set time and begin where you left off the next day. She would tell me, ‘There is no such thing as a Sunday artist; one must be an artist every day.’” 20 But just as art was a constant in Archie’s life, so were John’s ﬁnancial troubles. In October 1942, Archie wrote to Franklin and Carolyn Blackmer: By the help of much prayer I was enabled this morning on waking to see that I should go to Cleveland at Association, guest of the Nicols—Mr. J. being much better—and look for work. The situation here is preying upon his health. I believe the Lord will guide me to something I can do to earn at least my own living and to turn in something to his expenses here so that he can continue in his home. I wanted you merely to know this. I don’t ask you to do anything but pray for me. 21 Carolyn Blackmer, then teaching at Chapel Hill School in Waltham, Massachusetts, knew of a recent decision to add an art teacher to the faculty, and by the end of October seventy-two-year-old Archie was on her way to teach in Massachusetts. She lived at the school and taught drawing and art apprecia-tion for the remainder of the year. A trip home on wartime trains at Christmastime led to a decision that Archie would spend succeeding vacations with her sisters in Washington. Soon after Archie returned to Urbana in June 1943, she was commissioned to do murals by two churches. Both were African-American congregations in a still-segregated Urbana. She described the project in a letter to Elise Campbell:"

Such a tremen-dous spirit of pure ﬁre! He sized up the difﬁculties as soon as he saw them and plunged up and down that long ladder week after week saving the enterprise a hundred times.” 23 Students in Archie’s painting classes also helped. Agnes McGraw recalls how she told her teacher that she was afraid of heights and couldn’t mount the scaffold to help paint the side panel. Archie, with no hint of criticism, suggested that she sit down and watch and maybe she would feel like it after a while. And to Agnes’s amazement, she found herself wanting to paint and climbed up the ladder to do the part assigned to her. 24 Archie called on all available resources and undertook an assignment that she considered just the right opportunity at a time when the paintings in her mind reﬂected her own reli-gious fervor. In 1944 the Citizens Committee for the Army and Navy was seeking artists to design triptychs for use as portable altars by chaplains conducting worship for troops in the ﬁeld. Archie’s murals came to their attention, and soon she sent six designs to New Y ork for their consideration. Finding that her designs did not satisfy the committee, Archie went to New Y ork to ﬁnd out more about what they wanted, and returned home to make more designs, one of which was accepted. Ideas for altar-pieces came readily, some sketched out and shown to others, some remaining in her mind, even more beautiful and not to be ignored or quieted. In 1945 Archie began two more oil paintings: a new Madonna and a new Apollo. She wrote to Bob Nicol: “[The"

But in January 1947 came a blow: the studio rooms had to be vacated by February 15. The immediate problem was what to do with the big pic-tures on which Archie had been working. Arrangements were made for the Apollo to go to the Court House and Grape Children to the Urbana Social Service Department, and Archie rushed to ﬁnish them. She wanted to enter the Apollo in an annual art exhibit sponsored by Pepsi Cola but found the expense of sending it a problem: “More and more it is neces-sary to do these things by myself (in secrecy). Their magni-tude and perhaps effrontery is disturbing; no wonder. . . . My John has stood so much of that kind of thing and lost so much money in freighting and, expressing, etc. I can’t ask it again. So all my endeavors I am rather ashamed of and want to keep as quiet as can be. The LORD will provide the money. And of course perhaps this picture really should not go.” 27 Often Archie reported events in her letters that were trou- blesome or disheartening—David had lost his job, her hus-band was not well or was unhappy, there had been tension with Margaret, or some disappointment at the college—but Archie learned to separate her work from those personal concerns"

She felt reassured of the worth of what she was called to do, and found enough signs from the Divine to enable her to transcend the daily complications of her life. The woman who, a decade before, had been considered “out of her mind” seemed to have completely recovered her stability. Her son David was now married and lived nearby with his wife Marjorie and their son David; they often brought little David to visit his grandparents. Archie treasured these occa-sions and often reported them in her letters: “Our little grand-child, David, is our daily refreshment and joy. He comes over by himself now to ‘so-prise’ us! and invites himself to supper. He hides under John’s desk and tells us not to ﬁnd him but look behind the door and other places and then runs out sud-denly—and great is the astonishment expressed by all.

Archie wrote, “Now Margaret with loving devotion has ﬁtted the old original studio here at 300 High . . . I could paint if I had the heart and t he time and the strength. I shall yet perhaps—before I go.” 30 As the time for the annual meeting of the Urbana Movement approached in 1948, Archie felt that her husband required her energies and canceled the meeting. Without an annual meet-ing and a studio, the Movement seems to have ended in 1948. In the 1930s and 1940s, the art world was absorbed in mod- ernism. Work that received public acclaim bore no resem-blance to Archie’s classic painting style. While that style evolved over the years, she was committed to a philoso-phy of art that prompted her to continue to paint in the Beaux Arts tradition in which she was trained, for in it she saw the potential for expressing artistic truth about human nature. Her rationale is explained in “Letters on Cezanne by a Swedenborgian,” a series written for John Cavanaugh when he was studying at Ohio State University. The “Letters” pick up from lectures given at the Urbana Movement on the spiri-tual basis of art and emphasize the interdependence of devel-opments in painting and in history. Commenting on Cubism and associated trends in art, Archie wrote: It is plain to those who reason from spiritual causes, so far as they can see them, that it was the prolonged habit of NOT seeing, of half-seeing, of false seeing from choice and indignant justiﬁcation, that brought about this unique moment in the fall of art . . .

She stayed with them for two months, then made a quick trip to Urbana “to gather up stuff to work with in Washington. Every step of the way I measure by what I promised my husband and by my feeling of being led. It’s alright somehow.” 2 Although she did return to Washington, circumstances conspired to continue drawing her back to Urbana. John ﬁnalized his will on April 11, 1950, not long before his death. He named his son David as his executor, and left to Archie “any and all property of whatever nature and descrip-tion, real, personal and mixed, including printed books . . . with the following exceptions . . . to my dear sister, Margaret L. James . . . I give and bequeath all my interest derived from my parents in furniture, manuscripts in loose form, and all manu-script books, diaries and notes, portraits, pictures, silverware, statuary, glassware, heirlooms, chinaware and articles of virtue.” John’s share of the James family belongings was to go to Margaret, while personal belongings acquired since his mar-riage were to go to Archie.

John spent many years poring over the accumulated letters, newspapers, and farm records, putting them in order. At times he employed col-lege students to help him with the tremendous task of creat-ing order in papers from three generations of the James family. Princeton University and Miami University both wanted the collection, but John had found it necessary to sell parts of it during the late 1940s in order to meet his own needs for cash. Immediately after her husband’s death, Archie had the library of fourteen thousand volumes incorporated as the John H. James Memorial Library “so as to keep it on its old shelves as a unit.” 3 Problems developed because Margaret considered the library her property and did not trust David, who she thought had sold some of the most valuable books to raise money to pay his debts. Eventually a lawsuit was begun to settle the issue; Archie spent most of 1952 in Urbana deal-ing with those issues. Meanwhile, rancor built up on all sides. Archie defended David and felt that she must do everything possible to restore his good name; Margaret wanted David removed as executor of his father’s will. Margaret kept her promise to John to provide for Archie, but wanted her to live in Urbana, which Archie refused to do unless Margaret would accept David. The situation dragged on and on, challenging lawyers and others who tried to help resolve the tangle. The two women, who had lived in a love-hate relationship for years and were held apart by John, now had no mediator. Sometimes one or the other would reach out in a loving gesture, but the issue of accepting David rose to undo tentative attempts to appreciate each other.

Archie knew that David drank in “moments of despair” and realized that he suffered inner conﬂicts, which she attrib-uted to his feeling insecure and bewildered because he was not “accepted” by the James family. 4 Archie was ever-ready to read signs of growth and improvement in David. Margaret could see no such signs, and did not hesitate to tell others about the latest evidence of David’s unreliability. Archie’s sisters consid-ered David basically honest but inclined to evade responsibil-ity and sometimes to swagger a bit. Franklin Blackmer, who tried to help in working out plans for Archie’s care, talked with all concerned and recorded his impression that David meant to do what is right. 5 Although she spent the winter of 1952–53 in St. Louis, Archie returned and took suite of two rooms in an apartment hotel in Columbus, ﬁfty miles from Urbana. She regarded her hotel home as temporary, for she really wanted to live with or near her sisters in Washington, but decided to stay in Ohio until David’s situation improved and John’s estate was settled. In the ﬁrst months after her husband’s death, Archie tried to work out ways to earn money. She contacted people in muse- ums and art shops in Washington, seeking pupils and oppor-tunities for exhibiting her work. She ﬁnished “Flashes on Reading the Bible,” a manuscript she had been working on for a number of years, sent it to a typist, and then to three pub-lishers. She hoped, too, to ﬁnd a publisher for “The Garden Gate.” She read some of her plays to groups in Washington. Little came of these endeavors, but at least Archie could feel that she was establishing connections and trying to ﬁnd ways to augment the meager income of $94 a month from her hus-band’s estate. Archie also turned to unﬁnished projects. She completed the biography of her father, titled “Biographical Glimpses of Frank Sewall,” and sent copies to her sisters. The biogra-"

The Call summarizes the ﬁrst thirty-three years of Frank’s life, until he became the president of Urbana University. The Defeat describes Frank’s sixteen years at Urbana and summarizes the books he wrote. The Victory includes, on the top half of each page, a presentation of the tributes read at the memorial service in Washington after Frank’s death, and concludes with a summary of life during his Washington pastorate. Archie’s own “Notes on the Making of a Home” appears on the bottom half of each page. It is instructive to speculate on why Archie interpreted her father’s life in terms of defeat and victory. The “defeat” to which she refers is the decision by the Urbana University trustees to reestablish a co-educational school despite Frank Sewall’s objections. The “victory” appears to be the recogni-tion Sewall earned after he left Urbana plus his role in bring- ing up ﬁve daughters. Y et Archie gives no indication that her father felt defeated and she stresses that he bore no animos-ity toward the trustees who disagreed with his policies for the college. Similarly, it is difﬁcult to see what kind of a “victory” is depicted by page after page of eulogy combined with a descrip-tion of the Sewalls’ method for bringing up their children. Although puzzling as a description of her father’s life, it would make sense for Archie to interpret her own life in terms of defeats followed by victory. At age eighty, she could look back on two defeats: the interruption of her ca reer by ner- vous prostration and poor eyesight when she was thirty-four, and the episode of being considered insane by the James fam-ily and forced to leave Urbana for Detroit when she was sixty-four. The long process of earning her way back after both “defeats” could be rightly labeled “victories,” celebrated ﬁrst in years of writing, and then in years of painting and teach-ing through the Urbana Movement.

What though each action of my hand is caught With fabrics, gems, habits and memory Unloaded from some ghostly argosy, Piling the narrow gateways of my thought Like clouds heaped where the stormy sun is sought That chasm of the light I search for thee?

Bob Nicol describes this side of Archie’s personality: [There was] a custom of hers which grew stronger through the years and which can explain many of the actions which people think of as bizarre. She used a variation of the old Puritan practice of seeking help from the Word by random opening. Where the Puritans would close their eyes and poke a ﬁnger at a verse which would give them orders from on high, she would merely let her eyes fall on the passage. I don’t want to belittle this, as I’ve received some wonderful help this way myself, but I do fear it, and feel it is not always to be trusted, not because of the Word, but because of the doubtfulness of one’s own spiritual associations at the time. It is a kind of I Ching, or spiritual roulette. Be that as it may, she not only believed in this guidance but believed that it should be acted on without delay to preserve the immediacy of the Lord’s help.

Indeed she tended to put her own interpretations on these reactions and ascribe to people feelings and attitudes that I am sure would astound them. It was not that she was not sensitive or discerning, for assuredly she was both in a high degree. But she tended to forget those talents utterly when she was caught up in some idea or cause, so full was she of her own concepts and the joy of feeling “led.” 8 Archie’s “own concepts” extended, at times, to being sure that she knew what other people thought without consult- ing them. She would then quote their opinions to back up her own, sometimes seriously misrepresenting their positions. Archie felt sure that what she thought was right, not recogniz-ing that others, also sensitive to divine guidance, might have conﬂicting ideas. People who were repeatedly caught in these situations decided that their only recourse was to have as little to do with Archie as possible. Others felt manipulated by Archie and dealt with the prob- lem by avoiding her. For example, she invited a friend to lunch at a ﬁne restaurant in Columbus and revealed that she was on her way to the dentist to have all her teeth removed. The friend offered to go with her and invited Archie to recover at her home.

T oward the end of her life, her sister Maud considered her “a mental case,” while Rachel described her as “an exalted ego.” Franklin Blackmer’s interpretation was an “unsocial ego,” a person so wrapped up in her own situation that she was unconcerned for others. Her letters, while sometimes pathetic in the description of uncertainties over money and housing, show her strong sense of independence, of wanting to maintain freedom to do her own work and to schedule her own days. In the sense that she did not respond to ordinary social sig-nals, having instead turned inward to signals she considered of divine origin, she appeared to “exalt” her own ego, to con-sider herself to outrank others. It was a lifelong habit, per-haps originally derived from her father’s encouragement to develop her talents, but hardened over the years by the necessity of maintaining herself in the midst of the alien and often unsupportive James family. An example of Archie’s independence and readiness for adventure is evident in her scheme to place her painting The Holy Supper on a trailer and take it around the country as a traveling worship center. She conceived the idea for the painting before John’s death: an altarpiece depicting the Holy Supper with the disciples gathered around a round table, all turned toward Jesus—except Judas, who faces outward. She described it in a letter to Elise Campbell: “The altarpiece is painted in oils, ﬂat, on a wood panel with a gesso base—the most approved mural form for centuries.

In spring 1953, she moved to Columbus, and had the altarpiece returned to her so that she could continue to work on it. John Cavanaugh, who was also living in Columbus at the time, helped her make the wax-wood frame. Although she gave up on accompanying it, she continued to try to arrange for a trailer and a minister to drive the painting on its missionary journeys. Archie ﬁnally considered the painting ﬁnished in 1954 and arranged to have it exhibited in the nearby F irst Congregational Church in Columbus. Archie was eighty-two at the time of her grand scheme for taking the altarpiece on the road. A frail-looking but hardy woman, she had more energy and dreams than many people half her age. Some described her as living “out of this world,” for she paid little attention to the practical realities that con-strain most people. For years she had lived with a reality that seemed more fundamental to her—the certainty that the Divine would tell her what to do and would provide for the things that really needed to be done. How realistic was Archie? A glib answer would be—and often was—that she was not in the least realistic. Who in her “right mind” would expect the American public to respond positively to a trailer parked by the side of the road offering communion to whomsoever, even if they were lured by beau-tiful music and a great painting? But perhaps it is worthwhile to take a closer look at reality and what is meant by a person being realistic. Usually to be “in touch with reality” means to be sensitive to signals from people and environmental cues about what is “safe” or “prudent” or “right” to do or, con-versely, what it is not sensible to do.

T o Archie the realm of reality included the spiritual dimen- sion as well as the natural dimension, whereas most of those who reacted to her did so in terms of the natural world. Evaluating spiritual reality becomes problematic because the information on which someone acts is private, collected from unseen forces and evaluated by the person in terms to which others do not have access. People who come to be regarded as saints—people like Francis of Assisi or Joan of Arc, Mahatma Ghandi, or Mother Theresa—are able to convey the power of their spiritual vision to others, although they may not be understood or widely appreciated during their lifetimes. For every person who is recognized as saintly there must be hun-dreds, maybe thousands, who are tuned to a spiritual sphere but are not considered saints, either because those around them are unresponsive or because there is some deﬁciency in their modes of communicating their own spiritual reality to others. It is commonplace to recognize that “natural” and “spiritual” interpretations of a situation differ; it is more dif-ﬁcult to work out responses that incorporate both bases in a way that is true to the requirements of each. Sometimes Archie alienated people because she was so involved with the spiritual dimension that she disregarded their rights and feelings. If she understood that she had erred, she was penitent and sought forgiveness. But some of the situ-ations in which she hurt or misrepresented others became so tangled and convoluted that they deemed it easier to avoid her than to try to straighten them out.

Through the Urbana Movement she shared her insights and her devotion to understanding and doing the will of the Divine. Her approach to life is captured by her response to a query on how the spiritual connection to the Divine affects the art-ist: “The result [of the connection] is evident in two ways. First, from the inside, the delight of creation becomes pro-liﬁc, the intelligence of design becomes expressive, the tech-nique of the hand and endurance of the body becomes ade-quate. Second, from the outside, the technique of [the] artist improves, an intelligent expressiveness is in the design, and a ﬂood of creative impulses waits for expression.” 14"
