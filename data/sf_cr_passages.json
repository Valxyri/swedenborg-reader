Dole, Swedenborg Foundation Publishers, Chrysalis Books, 1995. cover artgerald murphy A prominent figure and artist of the Lost Generation of avant-garde Americans in Paris in the 1920s, Gerald Murphy submitted a billboard-sized, Cubist-influenced painting entitled Boatdeck Cunarder (1923) to the Salon des Indépendants in February 1924. Because of its massive size, 18x12 feet, the officials tried tohang it in the hallway, but Murphy insisted on his work being included with his compatriots. T o conservativefactions and the press, Murphy irreverently commented: “If they think my picture is too big, I think the otherpictures are too small. After all it is the Grand Palais.” The work disappeared during the Second World War. publisher’ s statement The Chrysalis Reader is a journal of spiritual discovery published in honor of Emanuel Swedenborg, eigh-teenth-century scientist, civil engineer, and mystic. Swedenborg used his scientific orientation to explore theworld of spirit. Respectful of all lives lived according to faith in the divine, Swedenborg described the ever-present reality of the spiritual world. Individuals who have responded to Swedenborg’s ideas with the great-est energy can be found in the arts, especially in literature and painting, as well as in psychology and the social sciences. The Reader celebrates and furthers this Swedenborgian connection with the arts. _______________ Publication of the Chrysalis Reader is partially funded by a gift from Esther Blackwood Freeman (Mrs. Forster Freeman Jr.)."

Fogged in, our chartered cruising boat approaches with caution Swans Island off the coast of Maine. My cousin and I, young boys, are wearing orange life jackets. Holding on to the headstays, we peer from the bow into the motionless mist, looking for thelight from Burnt Coat Harbor lighthouse or for a red or black chan-nel marker.

      "text": "“Do you see anything?” my uncle calls out over the drone of the engine. “No. Nothing,” we shout back. I rub my eyes and look even harder into the fog. I imagine a great three-masted ship appearingacross our bow, like the wreck we saw in the mud flats in Wiscasset.My cousin slaps my arm with a piece of seaweed from the anchorchain. I nearly jump out of my skin. “Hey. Cut that out!” I hiss. Thisis no time for joking around, I think. In the end, through a combina-tion of cool-headed navigating and a little luck, we reach the harborsafely and anchor for the night. Some passages have a way of sticking with us. Recalling the ex- citement of finding Swans Island emerges for me years later, intactfrom the mist of memory. When reconstructing historical events,sometimes a facsimile is all that we have to work with. The cover ofthis Reader, Boatdeck, Cunarder (1923), with funnels and vents of a Cunard ocean liner, is in fact a ghost ship. The original 18x12-footpainting disappeared during WWII . Like the Lost Generation of American expatriates, all that is left of Gerald Murphy’s artistic voy-age into post- WWI Europe are the stories associated with him and his wife, a limited number of his paintings, and only this photograph ofthe ocean liner. No matter which byways we choose, we are all traveling our own paths of adventure. Passages: Timeless Voyages of Spirit explores mo- ments when people are fully engaged in, or caught unaware by, thebusiness of living. This collection of essays, poetry, and stories com-bines the whimsy one finds in fairytales with the realities of life-changing events. Breaking out of predictable routine, the writers dis-cover unexpected vistas of youth, middle age, and beyond. Throughimaginative interplay of past and present, coupled with moments ofself-awareness, Passages leads to watershed events, moments that pro- vide new understandings of who we are as we journey through life. Being comfortable in our own skins—accepting our paths of dis- covery as necessarily unique—enables the narrators of these essays,poetry, and stories to travel far and wide. Each writer shows that be-ing who we are while living in the moment is the big ticket—ourprogress determined as much by our perception of ourselves and our surroundings as by our trajectory through space and time. “Inthe inner meaning of the Word,”Swedenborg wrote,“to journey refers to the pattern and sequence of life.” T o that end, perhaps dawn’sbreaking light and color is a precursor of separation and growth,preparing us for our voyage out and return, transformed, to the placeof beginning.x Robert F. Lawson"

Places don’t simply cease to exist because we’ve left them. New travelers areexploring the moments we once inhabited. I’ve been wrestling with a dusty angel, trying to brush his handprints off my shirtwhile asking what became of the spring light. Are the things we surround ourselves with alive or are they merely mementos?Are they inert and heavy, or do they fly? When we first lived together, what awkward honesty that required of us. Claimingfew things or victories, we were rich in desire. The road that passes your door has never stopped waiting for you.

      "text": "preface: p. j. ruschmann Approaching the Eye of the Needle there was a gate in old jerusalem near the South Wall called the “Eye of the Needle.”So narrow was this passageway that a camel laden with cargo could not pass through. This left the camel driver withlimited options—all of them less than ideal and all of them requir-ing a man of some particular skill or virtue. One of the options was to unburden the camel to get it through. This meant minutes or hours of untying straps, loosening ropes, low-ering the cargo to the ground, leading the camel through the narrowarchway, carrying the cargo through, and then reloading the cargo onthe camel’s back. Such a tedious and arduous endeavor requiredsomeone who was strong, patient, and organized. Another alternative was to get rid of the some of the cargo, much like a sea captain ordering ballast removed from a ship to keep it fromsinking. Enterprising businessmen would often situate themselvesnear this passageway and haggle away some of the cargo at a fractionof its value. Others made a lively and lucrative business as porters.And then, there were the thieves—mostly poor children or teens—who would snatch a portion of the cargo and run off undetected andusually undeterred into the busy marketplaces beyond the gate.Seldom did the businessmen stationed at this gate lift a finger tohelp—they wanted the miserly camel drivers to learn that it was bet-ter to hire porters or to sell some of their cargo at bargain prices thanto lose it altogether. Choosing this option to pass through the gate re-quired an individual who was wise in the ways of the world. xiiiOpposite: Paul Klee. The Idea of the Towers.

      "text": "Another option, which was far from ideal, was to try one of the other gates into the walled city. These gates provided their own kind of nuisance for it was at these gates that a toll was charged for entry,and, worse yet, there were Roman soldiers stationed there with theexpressed purpose of inspecting cargo for contraband. As the con-quering occupiers of Jerusalem at that time, the Romans had little re-spect for the native people. They searched cargoes with impunity, of-ten taking what they wanted without recompense or reason.Sometimes they charged a higher toll on a whim or, worse yet, con-fiscated the whole cargo simply by declaring it contraband. The un-wise or unfortunate trader or traveller who tried one of these gatescould then be detained indefinitely without rhyme or reason. Thisoption was not one that any of them favored, but for those who did,it required cleverness, cunning, and more than a little bit of luck. The last option, which really was no option at all, was to go back to where one came from. Who, after travelling so far, enduring suchan arduous journey and all the hardships it entailed, would get soclose, only to turn around and go back? When a first-century prophet named Jesus ben Joseph preached that it was “easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle thanfor a rich man to enter the kingdom of God,” every listener who hadbeen to Jerusalem knew exactly what he was talking about. It was pos-sible for a rich man to gain entrance to the kingdom, though difficultand often fraught with danger. It took a man who was both clever andcunning, prudent and persistent, wise and worldly—a man whoknew that the difference between heaven and hell was often justknowing what to hold on to and what to let go. p.j. ruschmann is a librarian at Davenport University in Grand Rapids, Michigan, who is both humbled and honored to join the ranks of other writer-librarians, such as Jorge Luiz Borges and Philip Larkin.xiv P.

He was about fifty, thickset, and wore a rumpled suit.“It’sbeen in my family four generations, and eventually it will go to mydaughter.” “Surely you must have a price.” Corbin peered inside Ilse’s small plain house. She knew he was looking for her rocking chair. “Y oucould use some new furniture,” he said bluntly. Ilse saw her slender profile in a nearby mirror. She remembered when the white braid trailing down her back was a rich brown color.It didn’t seem very long ago to her, yet it was. “I’m going to turn ninety soon,” she said. “I have no interest in new furnishings.” “Y ou shouldn’t deny yourself the happiness that comes with liv- ing well, even at your advanced age,” Corbin said. “The money I giveyou for your rocking chair will let you buy luxurious sofas and chairswith silk upholstery.” Ilse knew that Corbin was the late Kendrick Cally’s nephew, his only living relative. He had inherited his uncle’s sprawling mansionand great wealth, and his business in a nearby city. “I have no need of luxury,” she replied.“People say your rocking chair rocks away worries and care.” Corbin wrung his hands in frustration. “I have so many worries inmy new life. I must have something powerful to soothe them away.” “Surely your affluence can find you many ways to relax,” Ilse said.Sometimes Ilse let people who were enduring terrible hardships sit in her rocking chair so that for a while they could find some peace Opposite: Marjanna Blackmer.

She hadn’t met him before that day, and his boldmanner made her feel uneasy. T o her surprise, Corbin did not ask.“I’ll pay you any amount you ask, and even if you don’t want part of my fortune, you must know someone who can use it.” “There is no one,” Ilse said thinking of her daughter, son-in-law, their grown daughter, her two sons, and felt grateful that none ofthem had any need of Corbin’s money. “Now go,” she said firmly.“I would take good care of your rocking chair.” Beads of sweat formed on Corbin’s ruddy face. “I have a special place for it.” So do I, Ilse thought. Without turning around and looking at her rocking chair, she saw the pale gray color of its delicately carvedwood. It stood in a corner of her living room facing a small windowand the tall trees beyond her tiny yard. “I won’t give up until you sell it to me.”With that, the tousle-haired man strode out to the street.Ilse looked at her rocking chair and remembered the story her grandmother had told her. Deneta was a mysterious woman, although not unkind. Still, many of the people where Ilse’s great-grandparents lived were afraidof her. For Deneta was extremely tall, wore long black capes, and livedin a cave above the hills. Y et Ilse’s great-grandparents had no fear of her, for she gave them potions that cured a variety of sicknesses,including a deep, lingering cough Ilse’s great-grandfather had. And on nights Deneta was far away from her cave and needed a place to sleep, Ilse’s great-grandparents always gave her hot stew and a com-fortable bed. Then came the night Deneta was walking through the forest and a terrible wind rose up. Knowing a storm would soon come and thatshe was too great a distance from Ilse’s great-grandparents’ house tofind shelter there, Deneta was left to the mercy of the forest. “I beg you,” Deneta implored the trees. “Let me find sanctuary within the branches before I am drenched with rain, catch a chill, anddie.” But all the trees cast deaf ears to Deneta, except for one.It was smaller than the others. Its bark was torn in many spots up and down the tree’s trunk, exposing wood of a whispery shade ofgray. Its leafy branches were not nearly as thick and full as the othertrees, yet this scrawny tree extended its strongest branch to Deneta.She climbed up, the tree cupped its branches together tightly to 6 Susan Liev Taylor"

She gazed at the tree that had shielded her.“Long after your fellow trees turn to dust, may you bring com- fort, joy, and peace to all those who sit upon your fine wood.” Then Deneta tapped the scraggly tree with her thumb, creating for an instant a bright aqua light that could be seen for miles around. One year later a fire swept through the forest. Only the tree that had protected Deneta remained standing. The local people becameafraid of that tree because Deneta told them how it had given herrefuge during the worst storm the area had known in one-hundredyears. So, believing the little tree was bewitched, they said it must bechopped down. They also decided to burn the wood, but when itwould not catch fire, Ilse’s great-grandfather took the wood homeand made a rocking chair from it. Deneta saw this and rejoiced.“It will never leave your family,” she said to Ilse’s great-grandpar- ents. She touched the rocking chair, and for a second it glowed withpurple light. “For thousands of years to come, it will give great calm-ness and happiness to all who rest on it.” Before Ilse went to sit in her unique rocking chair, she watched Corbin turn the corner one block away. She knew he would soon walkpast her church, where in one week she would be attending a partyhonoring her ninetieth birthday. Don’t come back here if you still think you can own my rocking chair, Ilse thought. Many have tried before you, and none have suc-ceeded. Then she sat in it and spent the next two hours feeling blissful.The next morning Ilse watched a young man holding a huge bou- quet of orange tulips approach her house. Behind him stood a truck-load of red, yellow, pink, and orange tulips. “For you, Miss Ilse,” the young man said, handing her the gor- geous flowers. He gestured to the sea of blossoms in his truck thatawaited planting in Ilse’s garden. “That bouquet and every tulip hereare gifts from Corbin Cally. Also from Mr. Cally is myself in serviceto you as gardener of all these fine flowers.” Ilse recognized the young man. He was the son of the town florist, who knew how much Ilse loved orange tulips. “Take all of them away, Rowan. Including this bouquet. I have no need of flowers from Mr. Cally.” This, Ilse soon saw, was only the beginning.Sweet cakes, fresh seafood, and countless other delicacies were brought to her door. Among these treats was the currant bread Ilse7 The Magic Rocking Chair"

She declined their services, and all the foods weresent back. Ilse also refused satin brocade sofas and chairs and gold inlaid mahogany tables delivered to her home. She sent Corbin a note.No more gifts.Y et Ilse realized Corbin had no intention of giving up. She sat in her rocking chair, which quickly soothed her with the great love in-herent in its wood. The next morning a young carpenter, who was also Ilse’s neigh- bor, appeared on her doorstep. “Mr. Cally is having a house built for you. It’s going to look like a small palace. Do you want to come see it?” Ilse frowned. “No, Gerard. This is just another way he has of get- ting me to sell my rocking chair to him.” “When people tell him no one outside your family can own it, he laughs,” Gerard said. The next few days passed quietly and pleasantly for Ilse because there were no further gifts from Corbin. With a happy heart, she wentto her birthday party. This occurred after Sunday’s church service.Everyone in Littletown was there. Ilse watched Corbin Cally mingle easily with its citizens.“I’m having a good time,” he said. “Are you?”“Y es, very much,” she replied.Corbin’s blue eyes stared into Ilse’s brown ones.“I won’t give up on owning your rocking chair.”“Nor will I part with it.”Then Corbin offered Ilse a sum of money that made her old bones shake from top to bottom. Some of the townspeople heard itand gasped. “I can’t imagine such a large amount,” Ilse said. “Y et you don’t understand, my dear Corbin. I couldn’t sell my rocking chair to youif I wanted to. It will always stay in my family.” “I’ve heard the story about Deneta. What nonsense.” Corbin walked into the crowd. At the party there was cake, and there were songs. Lively chatter, jokes, and laughter filled the room. But after a little while Ilse saw thatCorbin was missing from the festivities. And because she had a feel-ing as to what Corbin’s intention was, she quietly headed for the door. “Y ou’re leaving now, Miss Ilse?” Gerard said.Ilse nodded. “After a little rest at home, I’ll be back.”8 Susan Liev Taylor"

Y ou’ll be real comfortable in my old car.”“Well, that’s very nice of you,” Ilse smiled.A few minutes later they passed Corbin Cally’s truck.“Strange he should park it midway between the church and your house,” Gerard said. Ilse felt her feeling grow into certainty. Surely Corbin was inside her house. Even though it looked no different from the way she leftit: windows open, doors closed. “I’ll walk you inside,” Gerard said.Though Ilse felt no fear, she agreed.When they entered her house, she saw Corbin sleeping soundly in her rocking chair. He, like the others who had tried to steal hermagical piece of furniture, had exhausted himself trying to move it.But unlike the others, Corbin in his deep slumber wore the biggest,happiest smile Ilse had ever seen.

He was a bright student, acompetent second-baseman, and, at that time, a chef at the VillagerMotel in Lincoln, Nebraska. “I’m going to learn to play the banjo,”Robert told me one evening after supper. I looked up from a stack of freshman essays. A large portion of my past flashed before me, in vignettes. In high school I played thesnare drum in a twenty-four-member band. A young lady I was fondof—and who one day would become the proud mother of Robert—played one of the trumpets in the same group. But neither of us pro-gressed beyond “Colonel Bogie” and “The Stars and Stripes Forever.”Earlier, we had taken shots at learning to play the piano, she becausethe house her family had moved into from the country had a piano,and she was the only one who showed any interest in it, I because myAunt Ruby could play the ivories by ear, according to Mother, and be-cause I resembled my aunt—our eyes, for one thing, were the sameshade of green. Mother concluded that I had somehow inherited myaunt’s play-by-ear talent. Eloise tossed in the towel early in her career,her instructor insisting that the girl’s stubby fingers would never belong enough to reach an octave. My own dalliance with the piano last-ed longer, but not by much. I took little interest in practicing, andspending money on a boy who would not do his homework—in spiteof his latent genius—did not sit well with the one who had proddedhim into such a disagreeable corner in the first place. Mother, there-fore, gave me permission to drop piano. Money, she said, doesn’tgrow on trees. Our first three children insisted that they wanted to be musicians. The girls, neither of whom had green eyes, chose the piano, while theboy selected the trombone. Their parents, of course, because theywere parents, encouraged them. The son blew mightily into a mouth-piece for a week or so before he disassembled and encased his instru-ment for a final time. The girls, though they persisted long enough tomaster several elementary etudes, decided that the world needed lis-teners no less than performers, and tearfully—because their parentsinsisted—informed their teacher themselves that they were quitting,a trauma that even today disturbs the family psyche. Samuel Clemens declared in his autobiography that banging your head against a brick wall indefinitely is a sign of cranial retarda-tion—or words to that effect. T o illustrate his point, he discussed sev-eral projects he had sunk money into in an effort to become a mil-lionaire. One of these was a transatlantic cable, an adventure that ex-cited Mr. Clemens and no doubt all of those who, like him, had in-vested in it, and substantially. Unfortunately, his cable did not work 1212 William Kloefkorn"

      "text": "out, while another company’s succeeded, and Twain was left nursing his financial wounds. But he did not despair. He would become anovernight millionaire or know the reason why. So he invested a con-siderable amount—some fifty thousand dollars—in a linotype ma-chine that was about to be invented, one that would turn the print-ing world on its ear. Again, though, a competitor beat Twain’s inven-tor to the punch. And again, Mr. Clemens was left to lick his wounds. By that time he had learned his lesson. Twice he had banged his head, hard, against a brick wall, and twice it had repelled him. He wasa determined man, at times a stubborn man, but he was not a fool—or, if he was, he was God’s fool, and God, therefore, must share—divinely, of course—the blame. These investments had cost Mr. Clemens a great deal of money, but he felt that the experience had made him much wiser. So when aman knocked on his door and tried to sell him some stock in a com-pany that the man said would make a product that would surely bethe wave of the future, Sam Clemens girded his loins and stood hisground and kept his wallet in his pocket and turned the man away—but not before he had heard the name of the inventor of the producthe so adamantly refused to endorse. It was Alexander Graham Bell. The question, then, is not whether you should bang your head against a brick wall but, rather, when should you stop the banging? Robert had not said, May I attempt to learn to play the banjo? No, he had said, I’m going to learn to play the banjo. There was a certain- ty not only in the statement, but in his tone of voice. It left me littlechance to decide whether I wanted to be included in another effortto break through the brick wall. Already the die had been cast. “In that case,” I said, “you will need to buy yourself a banjo.” I knew nothing whatsoever about banjos, but I had not been the snaredrummer in a band of twenty-four members for nothing. That is, Iknew that your skills or talents could be severely impaired if you wereplaying a second- or third-rate instrument. I conveyed this insight tomy son. “I know,” he said. “That’s why I’m going to buy a good one, a Fender Leo, when I get enough money. Right now I have one that’lldo to learn on. It’s out in the car. I’ll go get it.” I was taken aback. Already he had bought a banjo?He returned in a flash. The banjo was a hybrid of reddish wood and plastic. He strummed it a couple of times, then handed it to me.It was surprisingly heavy—certainly enough heft to convince me thatit was all right to learn on. I turned it this way and that, and ran athumb across its strings, as if to suggest that I knew more about ban-joes than in fact I did.13 At Home Wherever Home Is"

I’ll be taking two lessons a week.” I didn’t ask him how much the lessons would cost, hadn’t even thought to ask him the price of the banjo. His job as chef at theVillager paid well, and Robert knew how to handle his paychecks. “She plays guitar more than banjo,” Robert said. “But she can teach me some of the fundamentals.” “Fine,” I said. Robert went upstairs to his bedroom, and I re- turned to my stack of freshman essays, thinking, Can it be possible? A musician in the house of Kloefkorn? Although Robert’s parents and his siblings had all tried and failed to master a musical instrument—had banged their heads against thatparticular wall—I nevertheless felt that this time someone in thefamily might succeed. I remembered Sam Clemens’ tale about hisfailed investments, recalling that the point of his story is that hestopped trying too soon. Who knows? I thought.Y oung Robert mightbe offering our family what Alexander Graham Bell tried to give SamClemens—a real chance to succeed. Fortunately, it worked out that way. when robert was very young, three or four, he would ask me to read him something, almost anything, before taking him to bed. Atfirst I saw it as a simple tactic for delaying sleep, which perhaps it was,but the delay never lasted very long. After only a few minutes I couldfeel his little body relaxing, and often he would be asleep before Icould finish whatever I was reading. I would read him poems, mostly, nursery rhymes that both he and I enjoyed. One late evening, reading through a new collection ofthese rhymes, I came upon a brief little poem that neither of us hadheard before. It was called The Little Elf Man. I met a little elf man once, Down where the lilies blow.I asked him why he was so small,And why he did not grow.He slightly smiled, and with an eyeHe looked me through and through.“I’m quite as big for me,” said he,“As you are big for you.” He asked me to read it again, and I did. Then he looked up at me and said, “Grow.” “I am growing,” I said. I slapped my stomach to prove it. “No,” he said. “Grow.”14 William Kloefkorn"

This was our first venture into the realm of give-and-take rhyme, into a kingdom of sound that pleases the ear. If grow and snow fit pleasantly together, then why not catand bat? Dog and frog? Head and bed? Over many nights we played the game. Always we started it af- ter I had read The Little Elf Man. Always the game gave Robert im- mense delight. T o heighten this delight, or to prepare for it, I’d read the poem metrically, exaggerating the iambs as I moved along, some-times putting a melody to the tetrameter and trimeter lines. It is possible, of course, to experience too much of a good thing. I became downright tired of The Little Elf Man, so weary that I want- ed to tell its author, Anonymous, what I was feeling. But I didn’t be-cause I couldn’t; although the author appeared in any number ofbooks, he was nowhere to be found. Robert meanwhile did not sharemy animosity. His respect for Anonymous never waned. I would readthe poem, and like clockwork the rhyming would begin—words withsingle syllables, then words with double syllables, or two short words,as we extended the pleasure. What rhymes with kitten? Mitten. Badman? Sad man. We were improvising poetry on its most fundamen-tal level. Bad man, sad man, where is your mitten? Bad man, sad man,it’s only a kitten! Then one evening the routine very suddenly changed. I read The Little Elf Man, of course, but I had barely finished when Robert jumped from my lap and disappeared into the dining room, wherethe family desk—a large oak desk with a roll-down top—was locat-ed. Through the archway that separated the dining from the livingroom I watched him pull out the chair from beneath the desk andclimb onto it. I could not see clearly what he was doing because theside of the desk hid his arms and hands. But I could tell that they werebusy at a project that maybe eventually I’d have the privilege of look- ing at. After several minutes he returned, carrying a white sheet of pa- per on which—using only crayons—he had created a drawing, a sur-realistic work that I had trouble making sense of. “Look,” he said, handing me the drawing.“Book,” I said proudly.“No,” he said. “Look!”I examined the drawing from all possible angles. The colors were primary, and thus very striking. “It’s pretty,” I said. “I like it. All of these green lines going up and down—they’re beautiful. Green is my favorite color.”15 At Home Wherever Home Is"

I held the drawing at arm’s length to give me a different perspec- tive. “Y es,” I said, “I can see now that the green lines are lilies.” There were some purple lines, too, shorter lines with a circle the size of a quarter atop one of them. The circle was an unbroken massof purple. “That’s the little elf man,” Robert said. He seemed to know pre- cisely where I was looking. “Y es. The little elf man. And this other color, the red—what is it?”I knew what it was, or thought I did; it was the “I” in the poem, the narrator. Robert had used a brilliant red to depict this character,a red as brilliant as that on the local fire truck. But while the short,straight lines of the other figure suggested a stick man, the large, un-even lines of this figure, the narrator, suggested something impres-sively powerful. “That’s me,” Robert said, seeming a trifle miffed that I had not recognized him. “Of course,” I said. “Well, it’s a fine drawing. We can put a frame around it and hang it on the wall.” “No,” said the artist. “I’m taking it to bed with me.”And so he did, and when he brought it downstairs the following morning, the wrinkles it had accumulated while sleeping with its cre-ator gave it a texture that enhanced its surrealistic overtones. Robert,for a time, did not appreciate the enhancement, but after I smoothedthe drawing somewhat with his mother’s iron and took it to thegarage and built a frame for it, one whose corners might have fit moresnugly had I owned a miter box, he was more than pleased.

On several occasions over the years I had thought ofthe book, of The Little Elf Man in particular, and certainly I did not need the book to be able to recall the poem. It had a permanent placein my limited trove of memorizations. I put the book on my desk, and that evening, after supper, I showed it to Robert. “Remember this?”16 William Kloefkorn"

When I had finished, he smiled. “I remember,” he said.“Didn’t we read that poem sometimes be- fore I went to bed?” “Many times,” I said. “It was your favorite.”He was reading the poem, taking it in again, this time at his own pace. When he looked up I said,“Well, what do you think of the poemnow? Is it as good as you thought when you were not yet majoring inengineering?” “I like it,” he said. “Nice cadence. Easy rhyme.”“Anything else? If you were in class, and the professor asked you to discuss what you thought was the strongest element in the poem,what would it be?” Robert and two of his buddies had enrolled that fall at the University of Nebraska, all of them declaring majors in engineering,a field that did not require courses in which one looked closely—orat all—at poetry. But Robert, who was learning to play the banjo, hada lot of poetry in him. “Well,” he said, “the last two lines are pretty good.” I recited the lines: I’m quite as big for me, said he, / As you are big for you. “So you think those lines are pretty good,” I said. “Why?”“Because they make me think.”“What about?”“About size,”Robert said.“About different sizes. Reminds me that not all of us need to be the same size.” And I remembered watchingHamlet being performed by a troupe from Japan, how Hamlet at the opening was sitting cross-legged at the center of the stage and how,when he came to his feet, the audience laughed—not because some-thing amusing had been said, but because Hamlet’s shortness under-cut the audience’s expectations: Can Hamlet be a tragic figure whenhe stands barely five feet tall? We moved then from size to color: Must a person be this or that color in order to be a complete human being? Religious beliefs? Dodifferences include one sect at the expense of another? Social posi-tions? Political stances? And so on. Later, remembering our conversation, I concluded that Robert’s reactions to The Little Elf Man reflected a perfectly natural sequence. As infants, we respond first to sound, perhaps because we spend thefirst nine months of our lives so close to our mothers’ heartbeats. Oneof the first sounds we hear after arriving is that of our own voices; an-17 At Home Wherever Home Is"

It seems reasonable to as-sume that in our subconscious we retain the sound of our mothers’heartbeats and, since we now have fully-developed heartbeats of ourown, we are inclined to respond favorably to a regular beat, and if thebeat is accompanied by a variety of intonations and repetitions, somuch the better. For a while, we respond less to what is being saidthan to how the sounds themselves are formed. Jabberwocky, Lewis Carroll called it; it appeals chiefly to the ear and can be soothing orthreatening, depending upon how it is delivered. Robert and I, dur-ing those early years, had done some improvising of our own: Now no new nard need noddle over nat, for frolic lies the fanfare in the fat.The ear of the child might find such a statement delightful; the allit-erations tickle his fancy, and the child smiles or chuckles as he asksyou to say it again, then again, until he too knows it by heart. Children who like to jump a rope know how important the beat is. It can be slow or fast, low gear or high gear, or some speed in be-tween. Or it can move from sugar to hot pepper, as long as the move-ment is steady. T o accompany the beat of the rope, they chant poemsto pleasure the ear. Fudge, fudge, fetch the judge. Mama just had a new-born baby.It isn’t a girl, it isn’t a boy—It’s just a plain old baby. The children do not wonder how or why fudge might be related to the judge; the answer, very simply, is that fudge rhymes with judge. Nor do they question the matter of preceding baby with newborn.Ever hear of an old -born baby? The rope jumpers need a line that complements the beat of the rope as it nibbles at the frontyard crab-grass, and newborn does quite nicely. And do they wonder about thebaby’s being neither female nor male, but “just a plain old baby”? Nota bit. They are not training to be pediatricians or psychiatrists; theyare jumping rope, ears attuned to the sounds of words and the slap- slapslap of rope against crabgrass, feet and legs working to jump high enough, and at the precise moment, to avoid the snarl that mightcause them to lose the game. Nor do the children treat the newborn baby gently after it has arrived: Wrap it up in tissue paper, Put it on the elevator.How—many—floors—does—it—go—up? The newborn is less a human than an unfeeling object, an “it,” and what the adult might call baby abuse, the child might see as18 William Kloefkorn"

The final line invites the rope- jumper to count the number of floors—that is, the number of timesthe jumper can clear the rope without missing. If those holding theends of the rope increase its speed, moving it all the way into hot pep-per, the sound of the counting as the rope hits the ground provides arhythm that makes the jumping both a challenge and a dance. There comes a time, of course, when image takes its place along- side sound, as it did when Robert translated The Little Elf Man by way of a crayon drawing. The eye does not replace the ear; it joins the ear,and together they respond to whatever sounds and images the poemconveys.When the child hears the line, A rubber baby bumper bumped a baby boy, he probably chuckles at the alliteration. When he is old- er, hearing the same line, he might ask, “Was the baby hurt?” His earhas heard the alliteration, but his ey e sees the collision of bumper and boy, and he wants to know the extent of the victim’s injuries. And there comes a time—time being both thief and teacher— when the reader not only hears the sounds and sees the images, butalso thinks about what they suggest. One possibility is that they suggest nothing beyond sound and image. Another is that they provoke a pleasantly wide range of pos-sibilities or meanings or insights or whatever it is one chooses to callthe reactions that the words have inspired. Robert Frost called it wis-dom: The poem begins in delight, he wrote, and ends in wisdom.Another dead poet said that the good poem teases the reader intothought. Another, using the word thought in a different context, wrote that a poem is “what oft is thought, but ne’er so well expressed.”When the little elf man says, “I’m quite as big for me . . . as you are big for you,” the careful reader finds himself wondering about his re-lationship to others—their relative sizes, beliefs, colors, opinions, andso on—until it is possible that the reader, having laid the poem aside,can take up his banjo or pen and go about his business both enter-tained and informed. i never heard any maddening screeches from the strings of my young son’s banjo—not even during his first few weeks of practice, or that evening when, having told me he was going to learn to play,he went upstairs, and I returned to my stack of essays. I could hear anoccasional plucking of strings, but nothing to fray even the most sen-sitive nerve. Without much searching, he seemed to have found whatthe other members of his tin-ear family had been looking for.

Of course, the states of temporality and eternity are entirely dis- tinct, yet related to each other. Their relationship is best described interms of dance or music.

Neither flesh nor fleshless; Neither from nor towards; at the still point there the dance is, But neither arrest nor movement. And do not call it fixity,Where past and future are gathered.

      "text": "25 There Is Only the DanceWhat is interesting about these lines is that they also spring from an attitude concerned with the relations of the temporal and the eter- nal; the same concern is found in several places throughout thepoem: T o apprehend the point of intersection of the timeless with time. . . Here at the intersection of the timeless with time . . . Here the impossible union of spheres of existence is actual . . . The co-existence of time and timeless is the puzzle at the heart of this poem, and it is in terms of journey that all aspects of time are explored: those that attempt to deal with this question and those that do not. T o understand how the temporal and the eternal relate to each other is concomitantly an exploration through our own lives of therelationship between heaven and earth, between earthly material andspiritual reality. Consequently, our attitude toward time is para-mount. If one takes the attitude, for instance, that we only live once,that this is the only life, it often leads to a life of pure acquisition andconstant gratification, for there is nothing other than the material lifeto motivate oneself. The concept of a moment, of a still point, be-comes a fleeting thing, the specious moment, possessed of no lastingreality as the past moves into the inexorable future. Section three ofEliot’s first movement, Burnt Norton, explores the implications of such a vastated perspective, in which the fleeting moment is a stateof disaffection between the two poles of past and future, with no ref-erence to the eternal. Here, our lives are described as though we areleaves blown in the wind: Men and bits of paper, whirled by the cold wind That blows before and after time. Reading these lines, I am made mindful of his poem “The Wasteland,” in which Eliot describes a similar attitude of mind driv- ing people to work in much the same way: Unreal city, Under the brown fog of a winter dawn,A crowd flowed over London Bridge, so many,I had not thought death had undone so many. The title of this poem is itself a mournful echo of what Swedenborg may have meant by vastation, and indeed, the last line cited above is taken from Dante’s Inferno, which in itself has echoes in Swedenborg’s Heaven and Hell. Far from being an objective ob- server to these events, Eliot was himself one of that crowd going to work everyday in the city to Lloyd’s Bank. These are no abstract Opposite: Dancer.

      "text": "thoughts, only his own feelings concerning his own experience, his journey. Clearly, Eliot’s journey is one that perceives the present moment, the moment of being where we are, as something crucial. It is duringsuch moments—moments some writers have called epiphanies—that a clarity takes hold of one’s mind and reverberates throughoutthe whole course of that person’s life. But these moments are not nec-essarily what are often described as spiritual enlightenments. No,they are also moments of total undoing, when all that is held to betrue and real suddenly evaporates beneath the significance of some-thing indescribable. This contrast is stated by Eliot: Not the intense moment, Isolated, with no before or after,But a lifetime burning in every momentAnd not the lifetime of one man onlyBut of old stones that cannot be deciphered. This condition is where the real journey begins, when all that pre- pares us for life’s journey is suddenly someone else’s wisdom, not our own, which is imbued with their intentions and not ours. The mo-ment of clarity—the wild thyme unseen, the winter lightning, thelaughter in the garden, the music heard so deeply—all these thingsalso lead to an undoing, and life’s journey can become a hellish ac-count of constant failures even among those things that are taken assuccesses. In the devastated landscape of a London torn apart by bombs, Eliot is taken on a Dante-esque journey in which life’s purpose re-veals itself in a process of constant undoing rather than achievement.Here, at the point of death, where body and soul begin to separate, alife begins to perceive itself against a background of rage at humanfolly, and then comes the recognition of one’s participation in it: And last, the rending pain of re-enactment Of all that you have done, and been; the shameOf motives late revealed, and the awarenessOf things ill done and done to others’ harmWhich once you took as exercise of virtue.Then fool’s approval stings and honour stains. It is at this point of realization, in the middle of the process of vastation and devastation, that the real moment, the moment in and out of time, that reality reconfigures itself and remembers the non-tangible relation of man to myth—the dancer to the dance—as theonly real source of salvation:26 Karl Birjukov"

      "text": "From wrong to wrong the exasperated spirit Proceeds, unless restored by that refining fireWhere you must move in measure like a dancer. This is the real key to the soulful journey, the refining fire and hence the process of purification. None of this will be unfamiliar to the reader of Swedenborg, in which this process is described in termsof regeneration. Key to this process is first of all the desire and thesense of lack and want for the truth, which by the time regenerationends has inverted itself, and it is the desire to act from a sense of whatis good that drives one forward. That point of inversion is also thepoint of greatest despair, for nothing remains to rescue us from ourold lives that we can cling to for support and protection. In the ear-lier work, “The Wasteland,” Eliot defines that moment in the mostbeautiful way: Datta: what have we given? My friend, blood shaking my heartThe awful daring of a moment’s surrenderWhich an age of prudence cannot retractBy this, and this only, we have existedWhich is not to be found in our obituariesOr in memories draped by the beneficent spiderOr under seals broken by the lean solicitorIn our empty rooms. (Datta means to give from the Upanishads.) We measure our lives and the journeys undertaken in them by the things acquired and the differences our presence made to it. However, that which is truly giv-en cannot be recorded and must be done unobserved if it is to havea genuine meaning. Is this not reminiscent of the widow’s mite? Whatvalue is there in public acclaim or in the large or small empire wepoint to as evidence of our lives? The moment—all the epiphanies that compose it—or even if it were only a single event, such as falling in love, changes our lives socompletely that we come out of the experience as completely differ-ent people, yet outwardly unchanged. Nothing can ever be the sameagain, as every subsequent moment of our lives is filtered and meas-ured through that moment. As each moment passes, so the whole ofhistory is constantly altered and updated and puts to shame the ra-tional idea of a static pile of knowledge that is to be passed on: There is, it seems to us, At best, only a limited valueIn the knowledge derived from experience.The knowledge imposes a pattern, and falsifies,For the pattern is new in every moment27 There Is Only the Dance"

      "text": "And every moment is a new and shocking Valuation of all we have been. I have touched on very little in terms of the totality of what these poems mean. Nevertheless, I feel sure that my words resonate with the reader of Swedenborg. Eliot became a Christian late in life, muchto the disapproval of his peers who saw it as rather unfashionable. Itmay well be that Eliot was familar with Swedenborg’s writings, but Ido not know. It is clear from what Eliot has written, however, that hisjourney in life was enriched by his profound perception of the eter-nal reality in relation to the temporal state—a very Swedenborgianconcept. Contrasted to our purely modern temporal illusion that ourjourney is a constant running away, getting away from it all, of lotter-ies and insurances to protect us and guarantee no vastation, a life thatacknowledges the presence of the eternal as part of its essential fab-ric is greatly enriched by it, not necessarily because it is made com-fortable but quite the opposite. All lives are composed of theirtragedies and burdens. If they were not, then it is because they areprotected and thus incapable of the kind of sympathy and empathythat creates the desire to learn. But once we acknowledge our limita-tions, how little we can achieve on the basis of our own desires anddesigns, is it not then and only at such a point that the real journeytruly begins?

He says,“I feel as though I have travelled far from that place I was in as a teacher, and yet I have not been any place in thephysical sense.”His reviews and articles have appeared in various philosoph-ical journals and his poetry in other publications. Since the early 1990s, hehas written booklets and articles about the work of artist John Latham,which have accompanied the artist’s exhibitions at institutions such as theTate Gallery in London, the Museum of Modern Art in Oxford, and the IsaacNewton Institute in Cambridge.

I was with Jeanne, my teacher friend. At first, the subterranean sepulcher felt like a well- done haunted house at a fair—we shrieked and giggled, but the pre-ponderance of death sobered us: it was bones, bones, bones and morebones—six million sculls and skeletons taken from medieval ceme-teries and arranged into 4-foot walls that went on and on and on. Insome places, the heads made the shape of crosses. Although I didn’tovertly cringe, I made sure I didn’t lean against the bones or brushmy hand across them as I passed.

Some were ominous, like the one that said, “Death is a blindmonster who will eventually kill all.” Surrounded by skulls and skeletons, my own mortality blew through me like a wind through cotton. As all who have worn a mor-tal coil, I too would shuffle off my flesh, my bones.

Eating pastries would not obliterate world hunger or make me immortal—I knew this. I was just thankful to have a body coursingwith life. Each tartine was an invitation to revel in that life. I could tell by the name, chocolat religieuse, that the pastry I found was exactly what I was looking for.

In 1886, her fam-ily left Urbana for Scotland, where her father, Frank Sewall, was toserve as interim pastor to a Glasgow Swedenborgian society. Archielooked forward to visiting places already familiar from her father’sstories of trips abroad after he had graduated from Bowdoin College. In Glasgow, Archie and her sister Maude, then sixteen and four- teen, continued their education under their father’s tutelage, readingCicero and Virgil in Latin and studying British history, philosophers,poets, and novelists. At a time when many art schools admitted onlymen, Archie enrolled in the Glasgow School of Art, where all classesexcept life drawing were open to women. Since there were many“new” women among Glasgow artists, Archie probably absorbedsome of their emancipated attitudes as she developed her own career. At the conclusion of his Glasgow pastorate, Frank Sewall took his wife and five daughters to the continent for a year of travel. Whereverthey went, there was thoughtful preparation for what they would see.Often Archie regaled her sisters with bedtime stories about eventsthat had taken place in the locale they were to visit the next day, sto-ries so vivid that the young tourists could “see the blood on the stairs.”As they travelled, the girls learned history, literature, and languages,lessons that remained vivid in their minds throughout their lives. 33Quotations from Archie’s memoirs are drawn from “Memoir of My Education,” written in 1946 as part of Archie’s application for a Guggenheim fellowship."

      "text": "The girls were expected to write about their travels, and each of them was given a sketchbook and told to paint. Archie’s sketchbook, entitled Through the Alps and Northern Italy was dated Summer 1888 and contains sketches and watercolors of castles, cathedrals, and sce-nic vistas, some painted in and around Florence in Spring 1889. Archie was most impressed by the museums—the British Museum where she “met the Greeks,” Florence where she “paintedcopies incessantly,” Rome where she “came under the magnificenceof the serene Raphael, which to me has never been disturbed.” In de-scribing Italy, she noted, “the intense individualism of every city andvillage, the beauty of line and its utter expressiveness, whether inmanuscript, fresco, or in bas-relief, or up-leading towers.” Music wasalso part of the cultural riches. Archie records: We settled somewhere near the door of Wagner’s Bayreuth the- atre for awhile and became engrossed in Parsifal and Siegfried. Maude taught us the dramatic motifs from the little parlour organ in our boarding house, and we practiced them walkingthrough the meadow to the performance. Of course, inDresden, the great orchestra met us again, the whole of theNiebelungen Ring; all the Beethoven symphonies poured out tous, sitting on the terrace above the river. Inevitably the children picked up signals that there was some- thing unusual about their family. Many stories from these days in Europe were told to the daughter of Mary, Archie’s sister. Mary’sdaughter recalled, “When walking in Europe, they must have walkedin a row, for my mother overheard a stranger say, “One, two, three,four, five, six, seven ,...c ounting off the Sewalls as they walked along.” No doubt the exuberance of Frank Sewall caught attention, and thesight of a family absorbed in sharing his appreciation of the sightsand culture of Europe must have been noteworthy. Frank Sewall, whom Archie called “an artist in life,” had a sense of ceremony and timing. He chose books for the family to read, intheir original languages, according to places that would bring themalive. Archie remembers reading “The Lake poets . . . as we dawdleddown the lanes around Nab Cottage ....S o m e w h e r e b e t w e e n Pisa and Milan and on our way to Venice, we read the whole of Faust, bothparts. In the villages of the Tyrol we read Herman and Dorothea.”Archie also attributes to her father a sense of selection, of determin-ing what not to do, as she recalls the family visit to France: It might have been with me in mind that our weeks in Paris were spent in the great palaces and gardens, some evenings atthe opera, some society among New Church friends, but nodallying as in other cities among people on the bridges and inodd corners of history.

Frank is a good name, but it does notfully express my life as Felix would have—it has been so very happy.” After three years in Europe, when Frank Sewall accepted a call to become pastor of the Swedenborgian Church in Washington, D.C.,the scene of Archie’s education shifted back to America.Although shehad little experience with schools, Archie returned to America as awell-educated young woman. She had learned art history at itssources, absorbed a broad background in the culture and literatureof Europe, knew German, Italian, French, and Latin, and studied phi-losophy and Swedenborg with her father.

In 1999, the U.S. State Department began withdrawing embassy personnel from Nepal due to increasing political instability, and trav-elers were warned to stay away. My reluctance to return, however, wasmore personal. Mountaineering is a perilous form of adventure. In1995 an entire group of Japanese trekkers as well as many localSherpas were killed by an avalanche. I had made friends with theJapanese group two days before they were killed. In 1999 three porterswere killed by an avalanche on a ridge above my climbing team. I es-caped physical injury but not the emotional scarring left by helpless-ly seeing people disappear into a white abyss. After that, I just did notwant to be cold, wet, exhausted, or scared again. I thought I’d hadenough of mountaineering, but in 2003 the attraction to celebrate thefiftieth anniversary of the first summit of Mt. Everest with othermountaineers was too great. So I returned, and then again in 2004,and mostly recently in 2006. In my research of Nepalese guiding companies for the 2006 ex- pedition, I discovered Adventure Geo Treks and became friends by e-mail with the owner, Niru Rai. Niru and I worked out an itineraryfor a group of seven trekkers and novice climbers to arrive in Nepalon April 28, 2006. The plan was to spend a few days in Katmandu,and then do a fifteen-day trek through the Khumbu region and climbLobuche East, a peak just southwest of Mt. Everest. Unfortunately, after our reservations were made, political unrest in Nepal reached a crescendo. Massive demonstrations had brokenout against the government. The military and police were shootingdemonstrators in the streets of the capital, Katmandu. We began tofear that we would arrive in a country on the brink of civil war. Twomembers of our group canceled, leaving only five of us—Greg andBill from Indiana, and Vitto and Mark (Americans living overseas inSingapore and T okyo), and me. Nepal has a stormy political history and only brief periods of democracy. In 2001 the well-liked King Birendra and nine membersof the royal family were massacred, and the king’s younger brother,Gyanendra, was crowned. King Gyanendra’s rule became increasing-ly authoritarian and less democratic as he limited civil rights and dis-missed Parliament. In April 2006, shortly before our arrival, hun-dreds of thousands of Nepalese again took to the streets of Katmanduto demonstrate against the monarchy."

We were, thus, surprised and delighted to find apeople thrilled with the restorat ion of democracy and the prospect of a lasting peace. Major challenges are yet to be faced, however, asconversations with Nepalese revealed deep distrust of the king andworries over how the Maoists will be integrated into the politicalprocess. When we landed in Katmandu, there were fewer police and mil- itary on the streets than when I had last been there in October 2004.There were also far fewer Westerners in Katmandu and in the moun-tains. Other than a few intrepid Israelis, we were the only non-localson most of the trails we hiked. With fewer trekkers on the trails, nar-row bridge crossings were quicker and easier. After settling in at the Katmandu Guest House in Thamel, the old town of Katmandu, we spent a couple of days sightseeing. We viewedcremations at Pashupati on the banks of the Baghmati, ate lunchoverlooking the giant stupa at Bouddhanath, and walked among themonkeys in the high temples and stupas of Swoyambho. Stupas are Buddhist monuments with symbolic architecture representing Buddhist cosmology and are intended to remind fol-lowers of the path of enlightenment. In Nepal they are white-washed hemispheric-domed structures, like an overturned bowl, with the all-seeing eyes of Buddha painted on the four sides of a rectangular tow-er atop the white dome. Above the tower is a gold spire with thirteensegments representing the thirteen stages of Buddhahood. On top ofthe spire is a crescent moon and spike symbolizing the truth ofBuddha’s teaching as the light above the earth and sky. Smaller ver-sions of stupas are found in many Nepalese villages and local sacredplaces, and are called chortens. The last historical incarnation ofBuddha was born in Lumbini in southern Nepal. Prince SiddhartaGautama (563–483 BC) was the heir of a royal family. The prince re- nounced his royal inheritance to lead an ascetic life and seek enlight-enment. He became Sakyamuni Buddha, the Buddha of recorded hu-man history, after he reached enlightenment and his consciousnessbecame one with the Godhead. According to tradition, the remainsof Sakymuni Buddha were cremated and the ashes divided andburied under eight stupas in India. His followers circled the stupasmeditating and chanting, as they still do today at the great stupa ofBouddhanath in Katmandu and around chortens in villages high upin the Khumbu.40 Jeff Rasley"

Nepal expedition companies run treks and moun-taineering expeditions in the British tradition, meaning that clientswill engage in challenging hiking or climbing but will be well fed andsheltered in sturdy tents and warm sleeping bags at night. While ourporters carried 60 to 80 lbs. of supplies up steep and hazardous trails,we carried only daypacks with as much or as little as we chose. Eachmorning we were awakened with hot tea brought to our tents, alongwith warm water in a washing bowl for our face and hands. The Everest base camp trail snakes north out of Lukla (9,184 ft.) winding its way through the Khumbu region to Sherpa villages,monasteries, and yak pastures across glacier-fed rivers on plank andcable suspension bridges. Most stages of the trail were originally es-tablished by yak herders and Tibetan traders. The trail terminus atthe current base camp for Mt. Everest climbing expeditions is at17,594 feet altitude. In Namche Bazaar (11,286 ft.), the central village of the Khumbu, we visited the honorary mayor, Gheylsan Sherpa. Gheylsan served asone of the high-altitude porters on the first summit of Mt. Everest in1953 by T enzing Norgay and Edmund Hillary. I met and interviewedGheylsan in May 2003 for an article I was researching. I gave him acopy of the April 2003 edition of Outside magazine, which he had not seen, but which had his picture on the cover. He still had the maga- zine on his eating table when we visited in May 2006. His family was Mani stones and the all- seeing eyes of Buddhaare found at this stupaoutside Debuche,less than a mile fromTengboche. Mani stonesare inscribed withBuddhist prayers."

But yak dung burns witha sweet, pungent smell and has kept many trekkers warm in Sherpateahouses and lodges. In the morning we climbed up the Cho La, one of the highest and steepest passes in the region (17,482 feet). I developed a sinus infec-tion that sapped my strength, and I had a very difficult time makingit over the pass. Our cook, Dorge, showed great patience and sensi-tivity by staying near me as I struggled to the top of the pass withouthumiliating me with offers of assistance. We were tested severely with two very long and difficult days of high altitude hiking and scramble climbing up and over rocky pass-es. Mark, a reserve colonel in the U.S. Marine Corps, informed us thatthe two days were the most physically challenging of his life and moredifficult than boot camp. When asked how hard it would be to climbLobuche East, Ganesh replied with a cheery laugh that it would be atleast 150-percent harder than Cho La. Mark and Vitto decided thattheir goal to experience the Himalayas had been met, and they pre-ferred to pass on attempting the climb. In the morning they trekkedout with our climbing guide, Norbu, and two porters to head back toLukla. Bill had not intended to attempt the climb of Lobuche, so hetook our English-speaking porter, Gopal, and headed up to Everestbase camp. Greg and I decided we would lower our sights fromLobuche East (20,070 feet), since we both had colds, to the less diffi-cult Pokalde Peak (19,044 feet), which I had climbed in 1998. to reach pokalde base camp, our remaining crew, Greg, and I had to hike east from the Base Camp Trail and scramble up yet a higher pass, Kongma La (18,155 feet). Ganesh tied prayer flags at the top ofthe pass and led the porters in doing puja, asking for the blessing ofsafety for all of us in the mountains and our families at home. Prayerflags are colorful cloth rectangles decorated with Tibetan Buddhistreligious symbols and prayers.

Ganesh and ourcrew of porters are Rai, which are a “middle people” in Nepal; mean-ing they live below the high-mountain dwelling Sherpa-Buddhistsand above the predominantly Hindu people of the valleys. Many Rai,including our crew, practice both Hinduism and Buddhism. In the morning Greg decided not to chance it, so Ganesh and I began the climb up Pokalde at sunrise. We were the only ones on themountain. It was partly cloudy, so our views of the Everest Massif,just a few miles north, and the other mountain peaks in the area weredisappointing. But the final sixty feet of free climbing rock at over19,000 feet was one hell of an adrenaline rush. I collapsed into my tent totally exhausted after our descent, re- questing only a wash bowl and puke pan. I wanted to lie in my tentthe rest of the day, but, unfortunately, our climbing permit was forLobuche, not Pokalde, and another team had come over the KongmaLa to set up a base camp at Pokalde. So, Ganesh wanted to break campand depart before the other group came over to our camp askingquestions. We could be fined, and Ganesh’s guiding license would beat risk for climbing Pokalde without a permit. After only a half-hourrest we hurriedly broke camp and began the trek out to Dengbochevillage. Ganesh and I fell behind the rest of our crew as I was laboring at such a slow pace. We got lost in dense fog and had to navigate by lis-tening for the roar of the rushing Imja Khola River, fed by the glacierrunoff from Everest. What should have been a 3.5-hour descent toDengboche turned into 5 hours, as we blindly picked our way downrocky slopes. Reunited with Bill and Gopal in Dengboche, the next day we trekked through a vast blooming rhododendron forest to theBuddhist convent at Debuche and then up to T engboche Monastery,where we camped on the grounds. From the monastery, the view ofthe majestic white peaks of the great mountains of the Khumbu,Everest, Lhotse, Lhotse Shar, Nuptse, Ama Dablam, Pumo Ri,Tawache, Thamserku and others is awe inspiring. In the morning Ganesh and I obtained a private audience with the High Lama Rimpoche T enzing, who presides over T engbocheMonastery and is the most revered religious leader of the Sherpa peo-ple. Lama T enzing spent an hour in conversation with me (Ganeshinterpreting).

After Richard and George Jr. had grown and left home, Mrs. Carlson took occasional substitute teaching jobs. I remember shetaught me a few times. No matter what subject was assigned, she al-ways turned the class into a sing-a-long. In biology class she wouldpass out song sheets, change our seating according to our voice pitch,whip out a recorder from her purse, and lead us into song. She wasable to get even the most pseudo-so phisticated fourteen-year-old to join. “Our youngsters like it when Mrs. Carlson teaches,” the parentssaid. When I left the neighborhood for college, I gave little thought to the Carlsons until a letter from my mother told me that Mr. Carlsonhad died of a heart attack. My mother was sorry and I, too, had a senseof loss, but not one that lingered, for I was caught up in college life.“How sad, just when he could enjoy his retirement,” the neighborssaid. Then another letter came telling me the neighborhood was all abuzz over Mrs. Carlson. “She’s flipped out,” the neighbors said. Y ousee, soon after the death of her husband, she sold their new DeSotoand purchased one of those Volkswagen bugs.“Why a convertible andwhy red? What was wrong with the DeSoto? Why, it was this year’smodel.” Mrs. Carlson’s next move was to convert half of her garage into a music studio with a greenhouse extension. She had traditionalspring flowers in full bloom starting in January, and she could be seenworking with her plants well into the evening. “Why would she dothat?” neighbors asked. Of course, no one ever asked Mrs. Carlson those questions. My mother started to include a Ruth Carlson update written in the styleof a newspaper gossip column in her weekly letter. Those dispatcheswere fun to read, especially when she reported that Mrs. Carlson haddyed her hair blonde and that she left her house each evening around6 PM. She drove her red convertible to the railroad station and board- ed a train for New Y ork City. No one knew her destination, and noone asked, but the neighbors had their own ideas. As each new theory was put forth, mother reported it in her weekly letter/column. The most benign idea was that she was goingalone to concerts at the newly opened Lincoln Center. Some thoughtshe had a terminal disease and was getting treatment at one of thecity’s medical centers, but she looked too healthy and happy. Besides,she returned much too late for that. The most common speculationwas that Mrs. Carlson was having an affair. Of course, comments heldthat if it was an affair, it was too soon after Mr. Carlson’s death. “She50 Wayne Carhart"

Why wouldanyone want to take that awful train into the city?” Mrs. Jackson, ournext door neighbor, said. Then came reports that Mrs. Carlson started playing her piano early in the morning. She had moved it to the studio portion of hergarage. But she no longer played Bach, Mozart, or T elleman. Showtunes and popular songs like “T enderly” and “September Song” waft-ed from the studio, and neighbors said, over and over again, “Whatin the world is going on?” There came a letter from my mother—the second in only one week—with FLASH! printed across the top. Pasted to the stationery was a clipping from the New York Herald Tribune, a review of Ruthie Carlson’s performance at the piano bar of the Hotel Astor, just offTimes Square. Ruthie Carlson draws a crowd three-deep around her white pi- ano every night. No night is complete without several requestsfor her rendition of “September Song‚” that she sings with hersweet and longing voice, “It’s a long long time from May toDecember.” Ruthie Carlson is someone you want to spendsome time with at the Hotel Astor’s piano bar. I’ll never know if any of Mrs. Carlson’s other neighbors ventured into Times Square to witness this phenomenon or what they may have said. I can only report that on the night of my pilgrimage, I rec-ognized no one except Mrs. Carlson herself. I found a small tableclose to the piano and ordered a scotch on the rocks, exercising myfreshly acquired privilege to imbibe, and surveyed the middle-agedcrowd. Some were out-of-towners, but most seemed to be regulars,all enjoying themselves. The one who seemed the happiest, however,was Ruthie Carlson. When my eyes finally met hers, I was surprisednot so much with her twinkle of recognition, despite my new bo-hemian goatee, but with the sound of my own voice.

This mini- journey was to remind walkers when they arrived back at the begin-ning of the trail that God had been with them all along. I wantedthem to know that God is where we are. Forty years later, that corner of the yard is still wild. At times when I sit on the porch looking out at the wildness, I remember jour-neys of my lifetime—each filled with enormous energy and enthusi-asm for the unknown and for the ongoing search for more insight. The earliest journeys I recall were the Sunday afternoons my par- ents would take my little sister and me to grandmother’s house.Aunts, uncles, cousins, and other kin greeted us, each so different.Some swooped us up high in the air, rubbed us with scratchywhiskers, tapped us on the head, tickled us, hugged us tightly againstthe firmness of corset stays, or suffocated us in the aroma of perfumeor cigar smoke. Each person—in their own way—made me feel thatI was an important part of the family gathering, just by being there. Books were another source of passages into destinations both real and fantasized, each impregnating my imagination in a way thatwould morph time and shape my encounters with reality. There werethe woods where Snow White was abandoned and Bambi’s motherwas shot. There were stories of poverty and evil people or of childrengetting lost to be captured by pirates or wicked witches. Surprisingly, I recall few spiritual journeys at a very young age. Everything about Jesus and God and the Holy Spirit (yes—they wereseparately identified back then as three persons) was a known—a status quo—not to be pondered or doubted but a fixed part of my 60"

As an adult, my spiritual journey encompassed being an organist, choir director, a children’s choir clinician, serving on na-tional hymnal committees, and writing Sunday school curricula. Myjourney up to that time might have been subtitled: As It Was in the Beginning, Is Now and Ever Shall Be. Amen. It was all a “done deal,” done by those before me, like a well-trodden, back-and-forth path,with no unknown turns. While I might have been eternally encapsulated into a frozen faith, reinforced by all the knowns of my lifetime, an event of cata-strophic consequence changed my life, tearing down the fixedfortresses of my faith. Coming home late one evening from my chair-person duties, I found my front door locked. I was greeted by my dis-tressed husband who had taken our three children to his mother’shouse. He gave me an ultimatum—be his wife and the mother of ourchildren or spend all my time working for the church. I decided to follow a new path—one that would enable me to be home with the children as well as make our marriage a priority overplaying music for the women’s missionary society, weddings, churchservices, or flying off to hymnal meetings and workshops. The nextmorning, I went bawling along a new path to a nearby university,where I began the first of three degrees, six teaching certifications,and an introduction to a world outside the box that had defined mylife. I reminded myself God is with us where we are. In being divested of my lifelong props of rituals, hymns, prayers, and biblical scriptures, I had to start from scratch. It was through thisnew journey that transformation would begin. I had to see the lifejourney through new eyes. Another dimension to this new passage occurred on Palm Sunday, 1969. Our fourth child was born, eighteen years after thebirth of his older brother. By this time, my coursework readings hadintroduced me to the writings of Comenius, Pestalozzi, Rousseau,Froebel, Steiner, Montessori, Bruner, McLuhan, Gardner, and otherswho wrote about the development of the inner child. I realized forthe first time how profoundly the sights, sounds, and movements ofthe world were impacting the internal responses of our youngest son.As we looked at the world anew through his eyes, we discovered howcritical our interactions were and how our words to his experienceswould be planted firmly in his mind for a lifetime. Observing our youngest child changed our thinking and lives. In 1996, we decided to create a new kind of parent–professional coop-erative on the grounds of American Airlines DFW campus. The school’s mission was “to enable normal, gifted, and handicapped61 The Wild Corner"

A campus in the DavyCrockett National Forest was added in 1989 to provide environmen-tal education. We called it “Treetops-in-the-Forest.” change led to new perspectives .I thought about the gatherings at my grandmother’s house and wondered about the roots of such a motley crew of kinfolk. I learned that my great-grandparents cameto America from France and Switzerland as part of a Utopian colonyfounded by a French philosopher Charles Fourier who believed thatboth men and women should be free to follow the passions of theirlives. The colony LaReunion was on the outskirts of Dallas in themid-1800s and was filled with artists, musicians, tailors, physicians,boot makers, astronomers, vintners, and naturalists. I imagined theirnightly gatherings as similar to my childhood family gatherings. This ongoing transformation made me see my husband in a new light. He taught economics and history in high school, but his deep-er love was nature. After serving as a Marine in World War II, he nolonger wanted to hunt to kill animals. Instead he tracked animalsdeep into the woods to photograph them. It was this appreciation ofnature that gave him the great joy of taking children on outdoor hikesand teaching them how to observe and care for all living things. One of the most amazing parts of my journey has been leaving behind all the ritualistic rigidities of my past. I discovered the teach-ings of Emanuel Swedenborg in which I was drawn into a constantawareness of God’s presence and purposes in my life. Swedenborgwrote about uses, that every living thing has a use and purpose. Asour “uses” become known to us, each day greets us with opportuni-ties to put those uses into practice, wherever we are and whatever wecan do to impact the world around us. Looking out at that wild corner, I still believe wholeheartedly that God is where we are. I am keenly aware that we awaken each day to be alive to the uses God has for us on all our journeys, along new pathsand old, filled with meanings through all the moments and patternsand sequences that unfold in our lives as our transformation is com-pleting itself. christine kallstrom holds a doctorate in early childhood education and a master’s degree in special education.

First of all, despite the fact that every boy on Schaeffer Street would say he hated girls, each of them had a girlfriend. It did notmean the boy showed the least sign of interest in the girl or even everspoke to her. In fact, likely neither of them had much to do with thechoice. But some law dictated that every boy have a girl assigned tohim and in some inscrutable way a pairing was decided and univer-sally recognized. Why the system should exist, and how it could beactive in the face of the general attitude towards girls, was beyondFrankie’s comprehension. Secondly, no matter how much other girls gave him a pain in the neck, however contrary it was to the way other guys felt, because noneof them ever showed any sign of liking their appointed girls, Frankieknew that truly and with all his heart he liked Isobel Sheerin. Hecould make no sense out of it; he did not try. All he knew was thatwhenever he saw Isobel, or thought of her, with her skinny legs andblue dresses and a nose that was pointed and tiny, like a bird’s beakreally, but pretty, he was eaten up with longing for her. Elissa Mancini was olive-skinned and had eyes like black agates and of all the kids on Schaeffer Street Frankie wished his personalitywas most like hers. Elissa was full of good spirits and open in everyway and she never put on airs. When Elissa liked you she liked youwithout reservation, and she was as trustworthy as Lloyd himself.Frankie felt everyone in the world should be like Elissa. But it wasIsobel he liked in a singular way, with her dainty walk and pointednose and shades of blue. Elissa called now to Frankie and Lloyd Keller, his best friend, as they came by her stoop before any others of the gang were in sight.She stood at the top of the steps with Isobel. Frankie would not lookat Isobel, but he was aware she was wearing a crisply fresh dress withblue and white checks, and he could not help the tension she caused. “Would you like to come over to my aunt’s house on Decatur Street tonight?” Elissa said. “We can play Monopoly in the backyardand have soda and cookies. Just you two and Isobel and me.” In Brooklyn the early summer evenings, when it was cool and still light and the day was not yet done, were the most wonderful times ofall. Baths had been taken after a hard day’s play and newly laundered“good” clothes replaced play clothes.

He sensed the wonder of existenceand all the world had to offer. But never in all the summer evenings on Schaeffer Street had there been a prospect like the one now presented to Frankie.

Only . . .Unbelievably . . .Lloyd said to Elissa, “Nah!

To do what? Frankie raged. They had no special plans. And if they did, who cared about them? An evening with Isobelin privacy? More delighting joy was unimaginable. There’d be talklater, of course, but it did not concern him. Y et, as Lloyd moved on,Frankie fell in step. Even, incredibly, he said to Elissa: “Y eah. We gotta go.”Frankie was certain he saw a flicker of disappointment in Elissa’s Italian eyes. He felt he was wrapped like a mummy and wanted fierce-ly to burst the bandages and make Lloyd understand hewanted to go with Elissa and Isobel. But a force restrained him. He did not try toargue. Merely he strode along in silent fury, until, a way down theblock, he blurted: “Why didn’t you want to go with them, Lloyd?”Lloyd looked at him in astonishment. “Y ou wanted to?”Frankie held back for an instant, then spouted with a vehemence that laid open his anger, “ Yes!I wanted to.” Lloyd stared. He said nothing, as if he were pondering a facet of his friend he had never seen before. The two boys saw the gang gathered near the Irving Avenue cor- ner. “Oh, boy! Ring-a-leavio!” Lloyd said in anticipation.It was Frankie’s favorite evening-time game too, but instead of joining in savoring the prospect, he said to Lloyd: “I gotta go. I just remembered I got something to do.”Lloyd looked at him in bafflement.

T o circlethe whole block and return to Elissa’s stoop was a necessity. She andIsobel might no longer be there but he had to try. It was an affirma-tion that had to be made. Just before the turn into the opposite endof Schaeffer Street, he stopped running. His walk, as he caught his breath, was grim. He could not see the girls when he was ten houses from Elissa’s but they could be sittingon the doorstep hidden from view. He tried to appear not to be in ahurry, indeed to seem that he had no specific destination at all. Itmade no difference: when he came close enough he saw that Elissaand Isobel were gone. He walked more and more slowly, staring at the red-painted stone steps as he passed, hoping still that in some way the girls were there,but the stoop and the doorway were deserted. He thought now not of the mission to get to the stoop, but of the object. The sense of loss came upon him. It was as if, after all his long-ing, he could have had possession of Isobel, though he had no ideawhat possession might mean, and she had been ripped away fromhim. It hurt, truly and physically, and the nature of denied desire wasso incomprehensible that, although boys in Brooklyn never cried,Frankie wanted to cry. He saw Isobel in his mind, in the blue-and-white checked dress, laughing with Elissa and buying up property in Monopoly and,maybe, talking about him. Elissa’s aunt would be bringing refresh-ments. But it was only Isobel he missed, and all he felt as he walkedbeyond Elissa’s house was the misery and agony of deprivation. Mechanically, he headed back to the gang. He became aware of the buildings and alleys of Schaeffer Street, and the wall of an apart-ment house where kingball was played, and a potsy court drawn onthe sidewalk by the girls, but none of these came into focus. All of ex-istence was remote. There was hardly thought even, until, out of asurging within him, Frankie said, almost aloud: “I don’t care about the rest of them. I like Isobel.”Saying it was the beginning of release. He took note of the score of a racket-ball game chalked on the asphalt. He glanced into the fin-ished basement of the only single-family house on the block. Achebegan to ease. For a moment he felt a kind of meanness, then a calm.The great protector of the young, the ability to forget, drew its man-tle over him.

As a teenager, the idea of radically following Jesus and becoming a “Jesus freak” wasnot very appealing, but I strived to live a life of love and peace. Givingup my life for God seemed attainable, especially since I didn’t seemto possess much at that age. But as I got older, with more responsi-bilities—a husband, children, and more possessions—I looked againat what it might mean to save my life by losing it, as Jesus suggested.I certainly didn’t want to literally give up my life; I even had thoughtsand fears that if I prayed,“God, I surrender, I give up my way for yourway,” I might have to do something I really didn’t want to do at all,perhaps even leave my family and become a missionary or some-thing. My perplexity seems silly now, but it was real to me then. As an adult, I’ve thought a lot about “giving up” my way for an- other, my position, so to speak, as a way of actually transforming myrelationships and my life in the way that the divine does so gracious-ly for us. Like every couple my husband David and I have had manydisagreements. We generally resolve them quickly, but there are those times when a quick resolution is nowhere in sight. One such time,one evening at bedtime, we both got angry and upset. Over what, Idon’t exactly remember. He strongly felt he was right, and, of course,I knew I was right. There we lay in the darkness, and between us there was that cold, heavy silence. He said, “I can’t sleep; I’m going out tothe living room to read.” I thought to myself,“Fine.”I also thought to myself, the best thing to do would be to apologize for getting angry. But I just couldn’t seemto make myself move or speak out. After all, I was right, and he waswrong. I realized I’d have to talk myself through it because being inthis angry state of mind, I definitely did not want to give up my wayfor another more loving way. I wanted to hold on tightly because hewas the one who should apologize first. I could see this was clearlynot working. I prayed for guidance and received strength. I began to Joel Shapiro.

As I came to whereDavid was sitting, I reached out my hand, touched his shoulder, andsaid, “I’m sorry.” It was as if a wave of calm, of generosity, of love, came over me in that instant. Not just an emotion, but a physical sensation. I cer-tainly didn’t expect this incredible feeling. Our anger and pride melt-ed away, transforming the two of us. We each gave up believing thatour individual way was right and that the other’s was wrong, thusrestoring our love. What do we stand to lose from “giving up” or “surrendering”? Is it that we really lose our power, our control, and our strength? Orcould it be just the opposite? I believe when we have the courage tosurrender, we gain compassion, generosity, and love. When I did fi-nally choose to give up my will for God’s will and pray for guidance,instead of feeling “not in control” or uncertain, I felt totally free, no resistance, a peacefulness, like coming home to God’s unconditionallove. I could sense challenges ahead of me, but I was excited, not anx-ious or fearful. One of my greatest lessons in unconditional love and acceptance occurred with my mother when I was a student in Ohio. During mysecond year of college, I had something serious to say to my parents.I had put it off for as long as I could, but I knew I’d eventually needto ask for their help, guidance, and forgiveness. When I finally called,my mother answered. I told her I wanted to come home. Puzzled, she asked, “Why?”I said, “I just want to come home.”There was a pause, and then she asked, with a mother’s intuition, “Are you pregnant?” I couldn’t even get the words out of my mouth. There was a very long silence. Then I broke down and cried, “Y es.” Of course, I’d been afraid that she’d be angry and disappointed in me for being thoughtless and irresponsible. But without anger, with-out judgment, and without hesitation, my mother said to me, “Oh,honey, you just get on that first plane, and you come on home.”At thatmoment, her forgiveness and her unc onditional love transformed my fear and my uncertainty.

Are you having a bad dream?” She does not answer. “Call my mother! Now!” she yells. “Right now! I need to sleep in my own bed!” “Let’s talk,” I say, and carry her to my bed. “Charlie,” I say to my poor sleeping spouse, “go sleep in the secret bed.” He stumbles out of our bed and cozies into hers, only to return a few minutes later. “Here,” he mumbles, holding his arm out, on which is draped the sacrosanct blanky. Rachel and I negotiate from midnight to 2:30. I give her the sleep- ing teddy, a present I had bought with this crisis in mind.“She’ll helpyou sleep,” I promise. “She’s magic.” Rachel closes her eyes. “No,” she says, her eyes wide open again. “It’s not working.” “How about if we cuddle, and I hold you and tell you stories? It’s almost morning.Y ou don’t want Mommy to drive in the dark. Okay?” “Okay.”So I hold and cuddle and murmur made-up stories until she re- luctantly drops off, but any time I let go of her, she stirs and says,“Don’t let go.”At 5:30 her eyes pop open.“It’s morning. Call Mommy.” “ah, rachel,” i say. “Let’s go down and have a cup of coffee.” She looks at her ignorant grandmother and rebukes me.“I’m not allowed to have caffeinated beverages,” she says. “Sometimes I can have decaffeinated tea. Call my mother. Now.” “Rachel,” I say, “I need a favor. I’d like to watch cartoons, and I’d like company. Would you watch a little with me?” Her face lights up. “Okay,” she says. I say a silent prayer of thanks to the cartoon network. We watch, and I drink a lot of very strong,very caffeinated coffee. We last until 9:00. I dial her mother, and putRachel on the phone. “Mommy, I stayed the whole night. I’m very proud of myself.” She says, “I slept in the secret bed, and a little with Stessy. Now comeand get me.” We go upstairs to get washed and dressed. We work on puzzles until her daddy comes. “Go home,” she tells him. “I’m having a play date with Stessy.”“Ix-nay,” I say to her father, who explains that her mother miss- es her and takes her home. She gives me a high five as a final congrat-ulatory acknowledgement, and off she goes, pink suitcase in hand. I fall into bed.

My thirteen-year-old daughter had voiced both our misgivings about starting the school year—mid-dle school for her and my teaching at San Diego High School. I sat on the side of my bed to put on my teaching shoes. The black leather flats seemed like the heavy boots of a mountain climber.When I stood and looked in the mirror, a forty-year-old single moth-er looked back. Could I face another year of high-school students,theater productions, and the crabby man in the supply room? I ad-mitted to myself in the mirror I wanted to leave teaching and go tograduate school to seek a spiritual center, perhaps even find God. In the kitchen I made tea.

Steve had freckles and the easy- going nature of a bespectacled Huck Finn. “Good excuse to be late.” “I take this as a sign from God,” I sighed. “Y ou got it.” He stretched his arms above his head and leaned back. That’s the morning I decided to leave teaching and go to Berkeley to study religion. Who knows what moves us to change? For me, itwas the shoes, the dog’s face, and the breakdown of my car. The signswere calling me to obey a desire that had intensified to an obsession:I wanted to study theology and make a search for God. I’d take mydaughter and our dog. Maybe Margaret would grow out of her defi-ance in the quiet of a college town away from her friends and thetemptations of urban life. At the end of that school year, I hosted a cast party to celebrate the successful run of our student production Up the Down Staircase. I knew I had to tell my drama class I was leaving teaching. My rea-sons were not romantic—like taking off with a lover—and I wantedthem to understand. Fourteen teenagers hurried into the living room, bringing a burst of noise. I can’t tell them, I thought, but as soon as we’d served our-selves, I announced to the diners scattered over the room, “Some ofyou may have heard I’m leaving.” Steve squinted at me, suspicious. Icontinued, “I’m going to Berkeley to study religion . . . I’ll never for-get you.” I cleared my throat, glancing into the darkened kitchen. “Will you be a priest?” asked José.“Catholic priest? Oh, José, maybe I’ll be the first lady priest. Who knows?” at that time our american culture seemed divided over reli- gious matters. We had the Death of God, the conviction that God must not exist after the horrors of the world wars, a war in Korea, anda protracted bloodbath in Vietnam. Then, there were the people whowere leaving organized religion and seeking comfort in what theycalled spirituality as expressed in Eastern philosophies, chanting, na-ture worship, and house churches. I wanted to ponder both sides. The school of religion provided a place to ponder, read, and talk with others also captivated by matters called spiritual. I moved like amariner in easy waters from small apartment to library to classes. Ifound some gay activists committed to social justice and Asian stu-dents talking of “buffalo theology.” I found a professor interested inreligious humor and one who taught Christian ethics. I poured overthe materials and imagined myself on the way to inner peace. Instead of gentle sailing I had a barnacle stuck to my hull, my re- bellious daughter. No, that’s not the image.

She wouldn’tattend school and turned to smoking God knows what and hangingout at LaVal’s Pizza with runaways and truants. We battled over absences from home, hatred of school, and episodes of stealing. Shewas arrested, found driving a stolen pickup, and had drug parapher-nalia in her bedroom. I was in constant contact with the police andhad to fight the urge to send her to her father, who didn’t want her. I was never left to myself, it seemed. I never could get far from harsh words and the dark streets where I’d search for Margaret. Icame to despise the other students, the ones without children, theones who were free of the suffering I endured. I made every class as-signment—whether it was for religion and politics or a counselingseminar—about my wild daughter and how difficult it was to raiseher. If I’d had a hair shirt, I’d have worn it. The daily coping, the trying to keep my daughter safe, burned away my defenses until I went from a capable, tidy person to a vul-nerable, tearful, frantic person. I had to get help. I turned to a thera-pist for a while. I studied and prayed with a woman who’d written abook I liked, Prayer and Our Inner Wounds. I felt a naked yearning for peace, for reassurance, and for meaning in the upheaval at home. Three years passed, and my path took me into ministry—my own version of the priesthood, you could say. I finished my studiesalive and sane, Margaret at my side. She grew into a competent youngwoman—a skeptical realist, a defensive driver, and a fine hairdress-er—and her transformation happened by the grace of God. She wentoff to find her way, and I was assigned a small church in northernArizona. By the time I got there, I’d learned how to preach about thestruggle to be good. I knew what failure and guilt can do to the spir-it, and I’d found how to forgive myself and others. Nothing that hap-pened in that beautiful Arizona ranch country surprised me. I’draised a teenager. The mystics tell us that struggle—even failure—brings spiritual insight. It’s pleasant to think my struggles have brought insight, butI desired a crown, not the sour taste of inadequacy. I do have the oc-casional realization, though, and here’s my favorite: spirituality doesnot come from books offering definitions of God. Great perceptionsdo not come from yoga class and meditation. Spirituality—compas-sion, awareness and tolerance—comes with chasing and worryinguntil defenses drop away like old boots and you stand in bare feet. elaine greensmith jordan is a retired Congregational minister and for- mer high-school teacher.

But remember, be-coming angry at third graders accomplishes nothing. We must helpto educate everyone and lift the level of consciousness. So let yourcurses become blessings, and keep beginning as you pass through life. My life has been filled with many interesting passages, the first being my passage through the birth canal into the material world.Due to an illness and my mother’s poor state of health, she was toldnot to become pregnant since it would be a threat to her life. Hermother (my grandmother) decided otherwise, however. She em-barked on a mission to help my mother regain her strength and hadher lie down on the couch while my grandmother fed her constant-ly. After my mother gained thirty pounds, I was conceived. The nextproblem was a multitude of complications of the pregnancy and pro-longed labor with no child appearing. According to my mother, aftershe was told she might not survive a cesarean section, “They reachedin and pulled you out.” So my first passage was a very traumatic one, and I was born an ugly duckling. “Y our father and I wrapped you in kerchiefs and putyou in a carriage, which we covered and hid behind the house so nobody would see you and be upset.” When I asked my mom why Ididn’t turn out to be an addict or alcoholic, which infants treated thisway may become, she said, “My mother took you, poured oil all overyour body and pushed everything back where it belonged.”An infantmassaged in this way gains weight 50 percent faster than an infant fedthe same amount but not touched. In orphanages in the 1800s, in-fants were not touched to avoid spreading infections, and 90 percentdied because they were not touched. So to pass through life success-fully, we need to experience love. I realize that if we all had loving grandmothers, there wouldn’t be any ugly ducklings who have to struggle to discover their beauty,something which most of us never accomplish. So when in doubt, actlike a loving grandparent to ease the passages of others. Let your eyesbe the mirrors which reflect love and beauty back to those who look into them. Experience reveals that when someone you love is presentduring labor or any painful experience, the pain experienced is dra-matically reduced. at age four, while sitting on my bed at home due to an ear infec- tion, I almost choked to death on some toy parts I had put into my mouth and then aspirated. I had an NDE, a near death experience,and left my body. I was free of the physical struggle to breathe. It wasa fantastic experience for a four-year-old, which left me with no fearof death.

He be-gan to breathe again, and I was back in his body mad as hell that I didnot get my choice. I can remember yelling, “Who did that?” andthinking there must be somebody else in charge of the schedule ofpassages. The truth is that even the blind see when they have an NDE.I know this from my patients and the research of others. So when youpass from this body, you will become dreamless, unalive, and perfectagain. the next passage, which as a surgeon I cannot overlook, is simply passing urine, gas, and feces. If you are born with an intestinal atre- sia, imperforate anus, or other anomaly, you will learn very quicklywhat a blessing it is to not have an obstruction to these vital organsand functions. When the anatomical passages are open and function-ing, one can then focus on the mental and spiritual ones. When you do, you realize that all of life is a labor pain. The ex- periences we encounter, or which are prescribed for us, when con-fronted with life-threatening illnesses are like the labor pains of self-birth. I tell all my patients and the people I counsel to not do some-thing because someone else prescribes it, but rather do it because itis what is right for you. Seeing chemotherapy as poison or surgery asa mutilation leads to your having more problems than the personwho sees them as life-saving gifts from God. So remember, life is difficult but not unfair. How do I know that? Because everyone is complaining, so it must be fair. If you want to helpyour children, then prepare them for the difficult passages which weall must confront. If you don’t know what to do, here’s my mother’sadvice: Whenever someone you know runs into trouble say, “It wasmeant to be. God is redirecting you. Something good will come ofthis.” It took me a while to buy the package as a teenager, but I realizedmany curses have in fact turned into blessings and have redirected mylife.

Though he succeeded in circumnavigat-ing the globe, he never made it back to Spain. He was killed in thePhilippines leading a band of sixty sailors into battle against two-thousand native warriors. Juan Sebastian del Cano, who had earlierspearheaded a failed mutiny, was the only one of Magellan’s captainsto survive the journey. He led the half-starved crew of his ship, theVictoria, triumphantly into port at Seville. Of the two-hundred- sixty-five seamen who began the voyage, eighteen survived. WithMagellan not around to reveal him for the irresolute mutineer he was,Del Cano and his crew received a hero’s welcome. In Madrid, I took a room in a hostel on a narrow alley off the Puerta del Sol. Directly across the street was a rundown coin laundry.Next door was a fruiteria whose produce was mostly overripe. On thefront wall of the hostel was a bronze plaque that announced to thehandful of people who found their way down the alley that this wasthe abode where the famous author Miguel de Cervantes Saavedraspent the last years of his life. Someone once told me that Cervanteswas the Shakespeare of Spain. The two great writers actually passedaway within a month of each other. Spain was the most powerful country on earth for nearly a cen- tury. Her armada of battleships was considered invincible. Duringthat period, Queen Isabella I and King Ferdinand V funded the Italiannavigator Christopher Columbus in his several voyages to what he in-sisted were the Indies. The man after whom cities and countrieswould be named and for whom statues and monuments withoutnumber have been erected was later jailed on a trumped-up chargethat amounted to mismanagement. In El Parque de Buen Retiro, I met a woman with deep brown eyes and full, sensuous lips that reminded me of Sandra. She invitedme to the bullfights, but I declined. It didn’t sound like such a fairfight. After a month in Madrid, I decided to head south. During the bus ride to Granada, one of our tires blew. We pulled to the side of anopen stretch of highway. It was blazing hot. I sat on the dusty groundagainst a chain link fence and let the sun beat down on my face. It feltgood. The driver—a flabby, middle-aged man—was unperturbed by the turn of events. He opened a compartment on the side of the busand pulled out a spare tire, some tools, and a canvas bag.

About five minutes later, a heavy-set, elderly woman in a brown smock and black shawl came over and asked me in Spanish to helpthe driver. I pretended I didn’t understand. Isabella and Ferdinand were interred in Granada. It was a polit- ical decision. She was from Castile, and he from Aragon. Their mar-riage merged the two kingdoms and enabled them to drive the Moorsfrom Granada, not to mention the Jews and almost everyone else whodidn’t share their theo-sociological beliefs. When they died, theirhome states wanted each of them buried in native soil. They had wedto unite the country; their deaths nearly tore it apart. In the cathedral at Granada, I caught a street urchin trying to pick my pocket. He was tall and skinny with a long, hooked nose. His darkfeatures made me think he was one of the gypsies that lived in thecaves across from the Alhambra. Feeling a slight tug at my hip pock-et, I slapped his hand away and spun around to face him. Seeing that the jig was up, he feigned imbecility, shouting: “Soy loco, soy loco!” I thought about bashing his skull in against Isabella’s sarcopha- gus. Instead, I pulled a one-thousand peseta note from my wallet andhanded it to him. He accepted it in perplexed silence. Behind him wasan el Greco version of La Pieta. In it, the Virgin Mary cradled Jesus’slifeless body as she wept. At my pension in Granada, I met an Australian who was back- packing her way across Europe. She wore a deep sorrow just beneathher smile, the way Sandra had toward the end. I’d crossed an oceanto get away from her, but everywhere I looked, she was there. TheAustralian, who couldn’t have been more than twenty, had spent thewinter cleaning rooms at a ski resort in Switzerland. There she’d fall-en deeply in love with a boy from Prague who also worked at the ho-tel as a bellhop. She told me she had to return to Australia in a fewweeks, and she was worried she might never see her young man again.I had no response. I told her that I’d heard that the southern half ofSpain would be completely desert within fifty years. When I returned to Madrid, I fell ill. I curled up in a fetal posi- tion on my narrow, single bed. My head throbbed and waves of nau-sea rolled over me. After three days without eating, I gathered mystrength and headed downstairs. I asked the senora—a stout, grayingwoman who was by turns impatient and irritable, and then sweet andmotherly—where I could find a doctor. She knew I had a lot of be-longings in my room upstairs, so she must have been afraid I mightdie before settling my bill because she asked me to pay the balancebefore leaving. Then she directed me to the nearest hospital.87 Red Earth, Golden Sky"

I staggered outside and caught a cab back to my hostel.The fourth day, I was lying naked on top of rumpled, sweat- soaked sheets. Half delirious from fever and lack of food, I was con-vinced I could see Cervantes’ long, lean body seated at the small writ-ing table against the opposite wall. His narrow back, the back that hadbeen whipped as a galley slave in his youth, was hunched forward,and his withered left arm had been placed delicately atop the table.He was writing something. A new wave of nausea gripped me, andmy head began to throb as I propped myself up on my elbows for abetter look. Turning to me, a wan smile spread across his gaunt,deeply lined face. Though the smile was sad, infinitely sad, it lackedall bitterness or contempt. I blinked to make sure I wasn’t hallucinat-ing, and he was gone. The fifth day, I still hadn’t eaten, and the fever continued to rage. The prospect of dying in a tiny room, thousands of miles from homebecame alarmingly real.

He patted hershoulder and said, “Don’t keep anything from me,” then efficientlydropped off to sleep. And how will I tell you? she thought. When her knees hurt, she eased her feet down. The little life in- side her struggled to hang on. It didn’t know how to grow into her.Was she ready herself? Her own mother had died when Leslie wasthree, and she felt as though she lacked some instinct other womenhad, as if she had never been attached herself. She curled around oneof the pillows. Hold on like this, she told the baby. We’ll hold on to-gether and won’t let go. Twenty minutes later she woke shivering. She cramped and felt a drip on the back of her thigh. She started up, felt woozy, and sat down.It was more than spotting now. She shuffled to the bathroom.“Don!”she called. “Don!” There was a fuddled crash. “We have to go to thehospital.” The doctor had warned her of the danger of hemorrhag-ing. But she would not tell Don that. He would go berserk. “Damn!” After more crashing, Don shouted into the telephone, “Bleeding! Y es, dammit! Bleeding!” He clunked her packed bagthrough the house, heading for the garage. Why didn’t he rush to her, wrap an arm around her waist, tell her everything would be okay? As Leslie emerged on the porch, Don 90"

They said to lie flat.” Leslie slid in gingerly while he jumped into the driver’s seat and thunked into reverse. He backedinto the street and braked so sharply, she nearly rolled onto the floor. Flashers pulsing, Don tore through the city streets. He honked and blinked high beams as he ran stop signs and red lights. “Not sofast, Don. Y ou’re scaring me.” “Every minute counts,” he said. It was as if they were driving to separate destinations. At the hospital they wheeled her past hallway doors so fast she felt dizzy. “I hate to put you in the maternity ward,” an older nursesaid,“but it has the facilities you need.” Leslie barely heard. When sheclosed her eyes, images of neon signs and tops of telephone polesblurred past. The sheets were cold, and her body wouldn’t warmthem. She gripped the mattress with both hands to hang on. Hangingon was all she did. She had felt that way for years. The hospital team weighed her pads every hour to determine blood loss, and her doctor said that if it exceeded a certain rate, theywould have to abort. Don sat expectantly the first hours, high-strung,lit-up from his race across the city. His anxiety was not personal forher. He could equally rush into a burning building to save a trappeddog. His excitement arose and vanished from his own inner demons.As hours of routine passed, though, he grew quieter, bored. He count-ed the ceiling tiles, then calculated the number of holes in the ceilingtiles. Pretty soon he’d multiply that by the number of rooms in thehospital and that by the number of hospitals in the world so he’dknow all the holes that were. As he counted, the older nurse, whosename was Linda, returned to let Leslie know her shift had ended.“I’llbe in tomorrow,” she said. “Wait for me.” Leslie nodded. in the morning new doctors and nurses invaded the room. What did it matter if she bled three ounces or three quarts? Did they un- derstand that a little life was trying to hold onto her? Leslie felt nasty,snapped at them like a harassed animal. When Don paced, she or-dered him to leave the room. The bleeding slowed, and Leslie finally warmed up. When the doctors said things were “stable,” Don told her, “We’ll have that babyyet.” He patted her hand to assure her. “Don’t be an idiot. Do you really think this is going to turn out well?” “I bought a newspaper downstairs. Want me to read you the news? Do the Jumble together?” “The Jumble?” What did he think they had been doing?

That afternoon heavy bleeding and the cold shakes returned. Nurses piled blankets on her and examined her pad every twentyminutes. One whispered to another,“shock.” One blessing: Linda hadreturned. She gently rubbed Leslie’s back and said, “Relax, dear. Justrelax the shakes away.” Her voice was kind and soothing. An hour later, Leslie’s legs trembled uncontrollably, and she cramped hard. Within minutes, they wheeled her to a delivery room,lifted her feet to the stirrups and sedated her. But Leslie wasn’t asleep,just unable to move. She wanted them to pour more stuff into herIV—knock her out so she knew nothing. But she couldn’t speak. As the doctor worked, she felt nothing—but almost would have preferred pain. She had been afraid to be pregnant, but she wantedthe baby now. What were these people doing between her legs? Shefelt herself melting. Inky fog rose around her, muffling the doctorsand nurses. It was like warm, inky water, and she knew death hadcome for her. When it covered her and hushed the voices, she hearda tiny, vague sound like whispering grasses. The baby’s voice, whis-pering something just beyond the edge of words. She! It was a she!She didn’t sound frightened or angry at dying. She was just whisper-ing to herself as she faded into nothing. She sounded almost happyat being spared life. Wait! Leslie pleaded. I’ll go with you. I don’t want to stay here alone. She felt herself rise. The grip of the stirrups and pressure onher back lessened. The inky tide buoyed her toward the tiny voice.Was the baby truly content to go? Was it okay not to live? T o not quitelive? She wanted to know, to see her baby. The tide had raised Leslieto the ceiling, and she saw the doctors below working on her ownbody. They were anxious and intense. She’d never seen herself thisway before and was surprised at how ordinary, how limp and tired,her flesh seemed. She saw Don in the waiting room too. He glancedat his watch and tapped the rolled newspaper against his leg. His wifewas dying, and he had no idea! She laughed. It was all so silly. Whatdid Don and she have to do with each other? Two years married andhe didn’t sense this extraordinary experience happening to her? What did she have to do with hospitals, family, or life? She never belonged here.

Fear, resentment, and pettiness drained from her pores. Bills, herhouse, and the squabble with Aunt Jill drained out. She grew lighter.Don was seeping away, then even the loss she felt for her mother. Shewas spreading into the air, flowing down the hospital corridors andescaping through its windows and doors like gas. Outside was a cold,clear night with stars as clean as crystal. She flowed into it, felt herfingers stretch into long, sinuous clouds and her fingertips extend totouch ten stars. Her baby was there too, ahead of her, whispering sing-song baby gurgles as she dissolved into the night. What would be leftwhen all Leslie knew and owned and remembered was gone? She didn’t care. As each piece of her life departed, she felt lighter and hap-pier, more herself than ever. This was not death at all, but life at last. A bump jarred her. The kind a canoe makes lurching over a rock in the current. What hard thing could be up here? Then the tide re-ceded. It lowered her toward the hospital below, and Leslie eddied asthrough a funnel back into the operating room toward her inert fleshon the table.

That was true. “I didn’t have a mother to tell me anything—” “No woman knows until it happens. And afterward, we forget— or we’d never have another child.” Her stroking raised goose bumpson Leslie’s arm. It felt good. She wished Linda would never stop. Leslie asked, “Did the baby die because I didn’t want her hard enough?” “No, dear.” Linda slid closer so her uniform nearly touched Leslie’s face. “No.” Leslie sniffed faint perfume cutting through the uniform’s hos- pital scents. How nice it would be to lie against her, pulled close andcradled like a baby herself. When Linda guided Leslie’s head to herlap, it was as if she knew her mind. Leslie settled into the warmth andwhispered, “Some mother-to-be!” “It’s fine, dear. I seldom have the chance to be a real nurse.” Leslie gripped a fold of uniform and pressed her face to Linda’s hip.“I knowyou’ll be back next year with a baby.” Leslie shook her head.

We just couldn’t fix it. At least right away, because it was not just a sim-ple fix. It was hundreds of problems. Parts were being rejected because the tooling for making them was designed badly, sub-assemblies would not fit together, dimen-sions were in error, vendors were not able to deliver because the blue-prints and specifications kept being changed, engineering change-orders were pouring into process designers by the dozens every day,and when an occasional product was finally assembled, it would notperform as designed and was rejected.

All this newness was because ofan explosion of demand for the advanced, high-tech aeronauticalproducts that our division of the Prince Corporation had provenourselves to be highly capable of producing in the past. Our very success led the U.S. Air Force, our key customer, to come to us and literally command us to double the size and capacityof our facility to produce the F-5 and the VGI, and under enormous time pressure. The products were so important that the U.S.Air Forcewanted to set us up as a second source for these products, originallydesigned and sold to the U.S. Air Force by our number one competi-tor, the McAlpin Corp. We did not want to accept this task, partly because it would be aiding our competitor to penetrate a market we had hitherto domi-nated, and partly because the products were still being designed andthe schedules were clearly going to be virtually impossible to meet. But the government applied heavy pressure, offered to provide us with all necessary machine tools, build a new building attached to ourpresent building, and added a strong measure of patriotism. Our topmanagement gave in, of course, and agreed to take on the project. It was an exciting time, for we were to double the size of the plant, the number of machines and machinists, assembly workers, all sup-port groups, such as quality control, production control, process en-gineering, and sales volumes.Very shortly after agreeing to accept thisorder, construction contracts were signed, concrete was poured with-in weeks, and a new management cadre was interviewed, and hiringsbegan at a fast clip. The F-5/VGI project was so big and our “regular” products were selling so well and expanding volumes continually that it was decidedto set up the McAlpin Program, as it came to be called, as a separateorganization in parallel with the “regular” organization. It was hopedthat the McAlpin team would bring new ideas and systems whichwould benefit the whole Aero Division. The management team whichwas hired in from all over the country came with outstanding creden-tials and was selected with great care and intensive interviewing. As aresult, while they were new to us “regulars,” they were clearly able andvery impressive managers, and with excellent, relevant experience. They went at their work with high spirits, cooperated with each other, and invested energy and ideas at a high rate. Amongst them-selves they were often critical of the more conventional and less “ad-vanced” system and management approaches used in the well estab-lished regular organization.

But the results began to contrast as the McAlpin team ran into the massive problems described earlier, while the regular team set new records. Despite the new team’s strong capabilities, efforts, andinitially high morale, they could not produce F-5s and VGIs and a sense of emergency, crisis, and frustration soon set in. Six months ofdesperate efforts solved dozens of problems with the parts designsand processes. There weren’t dozens of problems: there were hun-dreds and hundreds of problems. Hardly anything worked the firsttime, and the team worked harder and harder as nights and weekendsbecame a normal pattern. T op management, of course, pounced in, applying pressure and ideas. Plant Manager Henry Ellis, who himself had been hired fromGE only several years before the McAlpin Project, began to criticizethe new team (which had been reporting to him from the start).Managers in the regular organization who had been competing withthe new group took pleasure in their failures. They pointed out toEllis the mistakes the new managers were making, and shortly hefired several of the men who had been hired for the project. A team was dispatched to visit the McAlpin plant to see how they were doing with the same new products. They found to their delightbut also their disappointment that McAlpin could be of no helpwhatsoever. They were having the same massive, totally disastrousproblems that we were having. My job was as assistant to the plant manager. In this position I worked with both the old group and the new group. I came to respectmany of the new managers and heard of their frustrations and com-plaints about the regular team’s managers, systems, and attitudes.They felt that they had never been accepted as equals by the regularteam’s managers, and when cooperation in the use of facilities andworkers was needed, it was often denied. The alienation between the two groups grew worse as the new group slipped further and further behind in the schedule, and the na-tion’s war-effort pressures intensified on the Prince Company. After another few months of failure, Henry Ellis, with the con- currence of Lewis Trane, the operations manager over productionand engineering to whom he reported, decided on a total reorgani-zation of Aero Production. Each and every management function inthe McAlpin organization would report to the head of that functionin the regular organization. In effect, this abolished the separateMcAlpin operation by placing it all under the old, regular team. Theregulars, the old-timers had won. The competition was over.101 Under New Management"

Under this intensive spotlight, all the way up to the Pentagon and the White House, Ellis turned up the heat on himself and his people.He showed no panic or temper but got involved more personally inall parts and assembly problems. He demanded action, explanations,fixes, and results. Among his subordinates the heat was on. They dug into every de- tail, isolating problems and causes and fixing more dozens of indi-vidual problems. The plant manager held meetings in his large officethree times weekly for about three hours at a time with twenty to thir-ty managers in attendance, each prepared to explain what was beingdone on each problem. Generally the problems were identified bypart numbers, and each meeting covered about a hundred parts. Under all this pressure and the firings of some key people, some of the nine regular managers began to show their tempers, blameeach other for the falldowns occurring, and try to defend themselvesand their organizations in meetings and with Ellis. Antagonisms were especially common between production con- trol and parts manufacturing, and between quality control and as-sembly. Relationships were tense, and with some backbiting andblaming and complaining. With the long hours and sixty-hour workweeks and yet continued poor results, tempers grew short, and thespirit in the previously successful organization soured day by day. Little by little a few of each set of products were completed, ac- cepted, and shipped. But the numbers were tiny: where three hun-dred or more sets were needed, we were only producing about threea week and the rate of increase was not encouraging. One day maintenance workers wheeled in a cart with a desk and installed it in the plant manager’s office side by side with Ellis’ desk.It was for the operations manager, his boss Lewis Trane, who imme-diately moved from his office an eighth of a mile away, to sit besidethe plant manager. My office was next door, but I did not dare to walkinto the plant manager’s office, as I had always done. For two daysTrane was present all day in everything that Ellis did. On the third day I was way out in the plant checking on some- thing for about an hour. When I returned to report to Henry Ellis, Istopped at his door before entering and looked through the windowinto his office. I saw to my amazement that the office was filled withthe top twenty or so of our production management team. Ellis wasnot there. Mr. Trane was talking to the group assembled. He lookedvery serious. It was obvious that Henry Ellis was gone, probably fired, and the managers were being given the news.103 Under New Management"

Then I learned that Ellis had been fired (I had been invited to the meeting, but the secretary had not been able to find me). I never sawEllis again. Mr. Trane had announced that the director of labor relations for the corporation, John Rind, would take Ellis’ place as plant manager.Rind was about forty-eight, had been a successful plant manager atone of Prince’s commercial product plants and had been promotedto run labor relations only about eighteen months before. It was con-sidered that he was doing an excellent job. He had a reputation forbeing tough, firm, open, likeable, and smart in a practical way. He also had a reputation for having a good sense of humor, but when he came to work the very next day after Trane’s announcement,he looked very serious and was not smiling. He was clearly under theenormous pressure of taking charge of a major, broadly discussedbottleneck in the production of vital equipment for the Korean War.He had to succeed somehow where all his predecessors had failed.Most of us knew him, so introductions at his first meeting were verybrief. He said little other than that he would sit down with each of usover the next few days and try to learn what was going on. For ten days he never smiled. He spent his time interviewing the top eight managers in the plant plus engineering managers and menwho had been dealing with McAlpin.

On the tenth day he sent word to eachof us to meet with him at 0800 the next morning. We assembled around a table in his office. He was as serious and unsmiling as ever. It was very quiet. He then said that he had met atlength with each of us. He told us that no one was to be transferredor fired. Instead, he said, he had never met a more competent andproficient group of production people, and each of us in our profes-sional function was outstanding. He knew the problems we had weremassive and difficult. He felt we could resolve them one by one andget those planes flying. But, he said,“you have not been working welltogether. Y ou have not been a real team. There has been fear, defen-siveness, mistrust, and hesitation at honest communication. If thatgoes on we will all fail. Y ou will, we will, work as a team.

The river’s surfaceflowed 3 feet above the C&O Canal towpath, which is normally a half mile inland. The frustrated water drowned Great Falls and squeezedthrough Mather Gorge like an egg passing through a snake. One ofT om’s fellow kayakers missed her roll and swam. The current wasmoving at more than 30 miles per hour. They saved her, pulled herto shore just above a 20-foot standing wave at the Brookmont Dam.It was the highest river speed ever recorded anywhere. Ever. T om was the first to run Great Falls. That’s what I wanted to do. T om said I wasn’t ready. Said a Clorox bottle could run the Falls. Ithad to be done with experience, done safely, and done with style. Inever ran it. Even during a drought, when I could have walked acrossthe river to Virginia, I never ran the Falls. T om was grooming a generation of the best paddlers in history, and I was not going to be among them. Even the distant sound of thePotomac made me nervous. I was not worried about dying—onlythat I might not get my parents’attention. Like many Washingtoniansin positions of power, they were focused on more important, nation-al issues. Just after Watergate, my father had a massive coronary. Then by- pass surgery. He spent a long time recovering. T o decelerate his life,he moved our family to a fishing village in Nova Scotia. I transferredfrom Georgetown Prep, surrounded by a golf course, to Y armouthConsolidated Memorial High School, surrounded by a snowbankedparking lot. It was the first time I had ever been in a classroom with-out a tie and with girls. Fortunately, Nova Scotia has as many lakes and rivers as it does land. At a time when there may have been fewer than a thousandkayaks in North America, mine may have been the only one in NovaScotia. For the next ten years I destroyed my thirteen-foot monsterrunning boulder-clogged Nova Scotia streams, accompanied byfriends in aluminum canoes. My fear of rivers receded. the years passed. After a string of career U-turns—commoditiestrader, interpreter, academic—at thirty-two-years old I returned toWashington to confront my fear of politics. My father could not havebeen happier than to have one of his sons back home and trying hisline of work. He arranged interviews with old political hands on bothsides of the aisle. The interviews came to nothing. I think my fatherand his friends were dismayed by the new generation runningWashington."

My father’s one piece of advice was, “Be careful. These areimmature politicians.” Before long, there I was—back on the Potomac, charmingly retro in a long boat in the middle of a shor t-boat revolution. I was still wearing hockey jerseys. I found T om McEwan and other top paddlerslike Davey and Kathy Hearn, who had stayed on the river and becomeOlympians and world champions. In the Brookmont neighborhoodwhere they lived, there were more gold medals than in East Berlin. Soon, I was paddling more than two hundred days each year, half of them with my paddling buddy, Stephen. We cheated death manytimes over the next decade and kept each other from thinking toomuch about why we would even want to try. I traded to shorter and shorter boats, reducing overall length by 5 feet. The short boats gave me control, but the primal fears returned.My father said that my stubby kayak seemed to defy ArchimedesPrinciple, which I took to mean, You’ve always lacked common sense. And my mother left phone messages when it rained floodwater hard,saying, “For God’s sake you have children now.” The web page for the river level at Little Falls became my favorite. Some days I would hit it every hour. Y et, I sat out the flood of ‘96. Ishowed up. I started to put in. I looked at the serpentine beast of themain channel, and I felt my ass pucker. So, I picked up my kayak andwalked back to the car. Meanwhile downstream at Brookmont, Davey Hearn surfed calmly onto the 20-foot standing wave that T om McEwan’s paddlingpartner barely missed during Hurricane Agnes. The Miracle Wavehad a 100-square-yard bowl, and Davey had waited twenty years forit. He pulled a camera from his life jacket and started taking self-por-traits. A Park Service helicopter hovered overhead, the prop washnearly blowing him over. He was later arrested for refusing to let themrescue him. During the Nixon years, my father oversaw the ParkService when gravity sports like rock climbing and kayaking first be-came popular. He thought people like Davey Hearn didn’t deserve tobe saved. Every year, Hurricane Season coincided with Silly Season—the rush of legislative activity before Congress adjourned. Working firstfor the U.S. House of Representatives, then as a lobbyist downtown,kayaking gave me a reason to fail at my job. The river of politics stillscared me, and there was no gauge to tell me when it would flood.

I thought of leaving Washington, but the river kept me there. I told myself I only needed one more hurricane before I could leave,satisfied that I had tamed my obsession. I was really waiting for myfather to tell me that I had achieved enough in politics, that seekinga higher level might cost me everything. Waiting for another hurricane required geologic patience. I prayed for a fat Category 5 to veer up the Atlantic Coast, west into theChesapeake, and stall for a week. Instead, they sneaked into the Gulf,hiccupped across Florida, and skidded through the Carolinas. Beforework, Stephen and I did pushups and situps and ran slalom gates onthe Feeder Canal, dodging Canal Road traffic with our boats on ourshoulders. We practiced with members of the U.S. kayak team, whowould let us into their lineup and comment on our technique. Thiswould have been the equivalent of meeting Tiger Woods at HainsPoint and having him stop to give pointers. Often the air temperaturewas in the single digits, and the river gurgled like a polluted Slurpee.My life jacket would be so encrusted with ice that the zipper onlythawed on my way home to change into a suit, while I listened to BobEdwards on NPR . As the level rose in my life as a lobbyist, I foolishly thought the tan lines on my wrists and neck spoke of my superior life as a river-man. Some of my colleagues concluded that I was a freak who lackedcommitment. I should have been paying for the privilege of pheasanthunting on the Eastern Shore with Congressmen dressed like Orvismodels, not jostling with gray people in vile polypropylene in a shut-tle van along a gorge in West Virginia. I remember one impromptumeeting with my boss during which I expected to get fired and wasinstead given a bonus. I told myself the lie that the old rules didn’t ap-ply, that there was no longer a direct relationship between time andmoney. I rededicated myself to the Potomac River and started doingremarkably stupid things in my kayak. A string of high-profile politicians fell from grace.On the river, more kayakers were having close calls as the sport took off in popularity and young, bulletproof paddlers ran Great Fallsin shiny boats. No longer was the river only claiming bank fishermenwho slipped into the flood surge days after the rains had ended.Inevitably, someone died running Great Falls, sucked into Charlie’sHole, swallowed indifferently by chocolate milk. I was on the river themorning after, looking around each rock for the body. The ribs of adeer carcass gave me a fright.

Iwas overextended, trying to be a K-Street lobbyist and a riverman.My reputation seemed to decline in direct relation to the amount oftime I wanted to paddle, not whether I actually went paddling. Theriver became an escape from my self-loathing at the kind of lobbyistI had become. Then Stephen and I confronted Hurricane Ivan, when 50,000 more cubic feet of water passed under our boats every second thanpass over Niagara Falls—enough to fill the Reflecting Pool every fourand a half seconds. Our luck did not hold. First, Stephen and hiskayak rotated into a raging, pitchblend whirlpool.When he pulled offhis spray skirt to escape, he and his boat disappeared. T en. Fifteen.Twenty seconds later and 100 yards downstream, he reappeared,bluefaced. His boat shot lengthwise from the water, fell over, andfloated by his side. He clung to it like Ishmael to Quoqueeq’s coffin.I pulled him to shore, and he said flatly,“Don’t pull your skirt. Die inyour boat if you have to. At least we’ll be able to find you.” Late the same afternoon I blindly ran a drop, flipped over into a brain freeze, opened my eyes, and freaked out. I broke my paddle ona rock as I missed my roll and wrenched my shoulder. I hung limply,defeated, oddly serene, staring into limitless black at 4 feet under. Ithought, I will stay with my boat, but Stephen will not be able to help me, and I will die. The river filled my mouth, sinuses, eyes, and lungs. My mother screamed. My father shook his head in pity and would not call the Park Service. My colleagues did not look up fromtheir Blackberries. My wife worried alone at night then remarried.My children cried at the first Christmas, had a moment of silence atthe second, grew up, married, and told stories about their crazy firstfather. Then, thirty years of muscle memory kicked in, and I rolledwith half a paddle and scrounged to an eddy. I stayed out of the boat for six months and discovered claustro- phobia in an MRI machine while scanning a torn rotator cuff. I hat- ed my job and hated myself for hating it but felt overpowered, withthe current moving quickly, and the level rising. I stopped checkingthe river level, stopped reading the Washington Post.

He wanted to get nearer to it. As he moved toward thelight, the light dimmed, and when he opened his eyes, he saw doctorsand nurses, the bright operating-room lights ricocheting off every-thing stainless steel. It hurt his eyes when he tried to keep them open,so he closed them and woke up again in post-op, unaware that he haddied on the operating table. He had crossed over to the other side forabout twenty minutes before his heart could be restarted. Maybe itaffected his brain. I don’t know.

He made it soundas though there was a constant party going on in heaven, where peo-ple were reunited with ones who had gone before. I wish I had thatkind of belief. Tal said, “When I get there, I will see Jack again and all my friends.” “How are you going to recognize them, and how are they going to recognize you?” I reasoned, “Y ou’re going to be dust.” “The hell I am.Whatever is there will be recognized, which is why I’m not going to be cremated. I don’t want to make the resurrectionany harder than it’s supposed to be.” “But supposing you get killed when an oil tanker crashes into your car and explodes into flames. Y ou’re body won’t last a second.All that’s going to be left is a greasy cinder in the middle of the road,”I said. “It doesn’t take a second for your soul to rise. There is no time in heaven. There is no time here, only light,” Tal explained.“Time is justsomething you put on a wall.” “But Tal, supposing you don’t believe that. I can’t believe that.”“Well, T.C., it don’t matter what you think or what you believe because someone’s faith or lack of faith does not cause one ripple inthe universe. It is the light of this world, and that light is the light outof this world.” There was no sense of arguing with him. Even if you happened to ask him how the crops were doing, eventually Tal would talk aboutvibrations and auras and synergies, and we all began to think thatthere was something not right about the boy. After Laura’s death Tal started going downhill. They had worked hard and kept the farm going when everyone around them was sell-ing out to developers. They raised four children, two boys and twogirls, out of that soil. They taught them right. Tal’s children were thefirst in our family to go to college. After that they had families of theirown, moved away, and came back home less and less. They all showed up for Laura’s funeral, and when it was over, a few of the children tried to convince Tal that he should give up thefarm and move in with them. He wouldn’t hear of it. He said he wouldbe fine and that he had a lot of work to do because things have a wayof falling into disrepair so easily. But two months later Tal was gone.

      "text": "Somewhere between my Mexican childhood and American adulthood, somewhere between reality and perception, I have come to understand Swedenborg’s concept of humanness as a paradox. Forme, to be human is to be both empty vessel and creator, passive re-ceptor and active force. I see myself as a recipient of ideas formulat-ed long before. Nothing is new. Y et all is new. I am only the conglom-erate of genetic material and environment; nevertheless, I am unique,creating myself with every breath. Whether truth be paradoxical or not, in the calm darkness of a New England lake, I come back to my grandfather with stubborn in-sistence—a mountain, a fixed point in my landscape, even now whenwe no longer inhabit the same world. How often, when I trek throughMassachusetts snow, do I remember the ivy-clothed palm trees of thegarden he designed. I hear him—Mexican scholar and business-man—through the unlikeliest sounds: in the calm of Rachmaninoff’sVariations on a Theme by Corelli, in the allegro of August crickets, in the deep roar of a jet challenging earth and sky. I see him in my aes-thetic drive to transcend the commonplace: even in the woodwork ofmy house which wouldn’t meet his standards. Dents and children’sfingerprints draw him to me in silent, smiling admonition: you need to wash and paint your house, Sylvia. Seven summers after his death, my grandfather transforms a moonlit lake in Massachusetts into the Usumacinta of tropicalTabasco. The full moon cuts a path from the darkened shore to me inthe anchored boat. T onight there is no lake, only a river I never sawin the jungles of Tabasco where he tried to make the family fortune,a boy of fourteen. Fatherless. A mother and four sisters to support.The Revolution, eating its way into the Mexican soul and body, con-suming flesh and idealism alike. The Tamborrel family had lost every-thing, except for two parcels of land in the Mexican tropics. Y oung and ambitious, my grandfather resolved to claim and work his inheritance. He, a streetwise kid of fourteen, would hire aband of Tabascan men to go with him into the jungle for six monthsto harvest chicle, an audacious plan. Who in his right mind would fi-nance such a scheme? Y et there was one—a businessman. What didhe see in the boy’s eyes that made him believe he would see a full re-turn with profit? Whatever he saw, he financed the project. The city boy traveled the Usumacinta River and watched the moon as I do now. He harvested the chicle, paid his debts, and leftTabasco with ten thousand pesos in gold. But he failed to recognizehuman greed and chicanery. In one night he lost all his earnings toprofessional gamblers on a riverboat. “I staggered to the deck,” my grandfather told me. “It was night. A bright moon lit up the river. A breeze blew.

Anything but gohome empty-handed! Anything but admit how stupid, stupid I was!Then I thought of my mother, how lost she would be, and I couldn’tdo it. I couldn’t do that to her. So I went home in defeat and humili-ation, as poor as the day I had left—and started again.” A decade later my grandfather established a successful import and export company that allowed him eventually to immerse himselfin two passions: study and philanthropy. Although he left school atage nine, he became a most literate man. He had a photographicmemory that was a marvel and clear-sightedness that never left him,even in the end when cancer had savaged his body. He was a realist’srealist. Y et his objets d’art, like his house, his life itself, betrayed a ro- mantic spirit. The paradoxical man—realist and dreamer. Only now in middle life do I recognize that duality in myself. He labored over twenty years to write an encyclopedia single-handedly!Was that any less foolish, any less a colossal task than mine to writethe definitive saga of the Mexican Revolution? His volumes, thirty ormore of them, stand in silent dusty rows as do all four versions andtwenty odd years of my own magnum opus. T estaments in futility. I enter his study and pull out the Rvolume of his unfinished en- cyclopedia. My finger digs a canal through the dust. I can sense thefamily’s collective shrug: what wasted effort! But I blow off the dust,fine as the powdered scales of a butterfly’s wing, and know the hours,the days, the years charted with silent, intense activity. I remembernights when the world sleeps and the writer travels alone throughthat inner landscape familiar and unfamiliar, wondrous and fright-ening, erotic and bland, colorful and colorless. I know firsthand thewriter’s plea, charged with deep longing. It is the acknowledgement,fatalistic as Tristan and Isolde’s decision to face damnation ratherthan renounce their love, ambitious and hell-bent as Faust’s pact withthe devil, noble as Milton in all his blindness: Lord! Take anything away but my ability to think, to link words!In Abuelito’s silent study, I pick up a leather-bound copy of his memoirs. As I read, I know only too well what the process of writingthem gave him. Later, back in Massachusetts trolling dark water, gaz-ing at a full moon, I transform a lake into a river. Something else mygrandfather’s life taught me: that success and failure are the top andbottom side of a wing in flight. Despair is carried upward by joy; joydownward by despair. Both act that we may fly. I saw José Tamborrel’s despair in 1984 after cancer had launched its insidious attack. Despair ambushed him the day after my sister’swedding.

I kept thinking, I couldpull the trigger and make this all stop now before it gets worse. ThenI thought about my head, shattered by the bullet, and I started tothink about your grandmother or one of the children walking in hereand finding me! I thought about the police! My God!

Who am I, inmy healthy body, to judge him? I am not on the rack. We make choices all our lives. Isn’t free will the very hallmark of our humanity? It strikes me that self-deliverance from the rack is onemore choice, rendered good or evil by the motive more than by thedeed itself. The motives behind a suicide are as censurable or as com-mendable as the broad spectrum of human motivation. We shudderat a young person who takes his own life as a way of punishing hisparents. We applaud a soldier’s selflessness when he deliberatelythrows himself on a live grenade in order to save his comrades. Society tends to be less sympathetic when the motive for suicide is deliverance from extreme pain. If a house is on fire, is it wrong toopen the door and escape the horror of the flames? How is it differ-ent if it’s your body that is on fire with a terminal disease, and youbelieve the door opens to eternal life?128 Sylvia M. Shaw"

I gazed into the strange white landscape, the one that always makes me most keenly aware of the presence of God, perhaps because it is so extraordinary to have abird’s-eye view of the world, or because I am moved by the beauty ofclouds and sky seen from above, or because no matter how often I fly,I am still awed by the mystery of flight. For all of these reasons andmore, I found myself praying into the vastness outside my window: Oh, Lord, help us to do your will, to live useful lives. Grant us the courage to face whatever we must and to endure, if by enduring we serveyour purposes. But if our courage fails us, at least grant us the wisdomto know when our lives have truly reached the point of no return. Forgiveus if we err in our judgment; the flames are so painful. In the end, my grandfather did not commit suicide. He was the same fourteen-year-old boy who could not bring himself to take hisown life. Cowardice? Duty? Perhaps both. Our instinct for preserva-tion is born out of fear. Fear is a powerful motivator. So, too, is love.T o live with pain and uncertainty takes courage. There is also the is-sue of timing. In 1984, it simply wasn’t my grandfather’s time any-more than in 1917. I know that because one Saturday, several monthsafter the wedding, he phoned me from Mexico City, his voice vibrant. “Sylvita!” he called me by my nickname. “I feel so good! Everything is so much better!” He spoke with the voice of a young man. I still wonder at it. He had been granted a boon, a respite in the long battle. Four years later it finally overtook him, when he was too sick to take matters into his own hands. The hospitalization daily chippedaway at his dignity. Death was long and painful. Assisted suicidewould have spared him much suffering at that point. Mercifully, hefinally slipped into a coma. Children and grandchildren kept vigil,flinching at the raspiness of his breath, marveling at how his heartkept beating with stubborn insistence as the rest of his body shutdown. I was unable to travel to Mexico, so I said goodbye to José Tamborrel at the lake. Swimming into the late afternoon sun, I spoketo him across shimmering miles. And I felt him near on that last day.That is the chief paradox of them all. I think of that voice on thephone, so strangely young at the very time when he was old and ema-ciated.

His father, Jesper Swedberg (1653–1735), was a pastor of solid and simple convictions in aSweden dominated by the Lutheran state church. Alarmed by thecomplacency of his fellow Swedes, which he ascribed to solifidism,the doctrine of justification by faith alone, Swedberg denouncedwhat he called “faith of the head” and insisted that true Christianitymust be lived out in practice. Jesper Swedberg was a commandingpresence. His energy and uprightness enabled him to rise in his pro-fession: he was made bishop of Skara in 1702, a position he wouldhold until his death in 1735. Emanuel Swedenborg was born in Stockholm on January 29, 1688, the third child and second son of Swedberg and his wife, SaraBehm (1666–1696), daughter of a wealthy mine owner. Little isknown of Swedenborg’s early life, but he retrospectively provides aglimpse of his youthful religious experience in a letter written in 1769in which he describes being constantly engaged in thought aboutGod at ages four to ten and later about his delight as a youth in talk-ing with clergymen about faith. Swedenborg’s diary of his spiritualexperiences, written in his late middle age, suggests a link between hisearly and later spiritual life. He observed a close connection betweenrhythms of breathing and states of consciousness, and he remarksthat even in his childhood he was accustomed to holding his breathin prayer and to coordinate his breathing with his heartbeat. Whenhe did, he noticed that “his intellectual capacity would often begin to 131"

It is interesting to note that regulation and cessa-tion of breath is often associated with mystical experiences. OneBuddhist sutra says the Buddha’s breath ceased for six years as hemeditated before reaching enlightenment. In 1699, at the age of eleven, Swedenborg matriculated at the University of Uppsala, where his father was then a professor.Although the university’s ledger describes Swedenborg as “a youth ofthe best talent,”early matriculation was not such an indication of pre-cocity as it may appear: universities at the time provided somethingakin to secondary education. Already well versed in Latin, the com-mon language of European scholarship in which all his major workswould be written, Swedenborg enrolled in the faculty of philosophy,a curriculum that included science and mathematics. In 1702, JesperSwedberg moved his family from Uppsala to take up his bishopric atSkara. Emanuel was left behind with his older sister Anna(1686–1766), who had married the distinguished humanist ErikBenzelius (1675–1743), the university’s librarian. Swedenborg wouldlive with the Benzelius family for the rest of his student years. The re-lationship between Swedenborg and Benzelius was to become awarm one, and much of Swedenborg’s early correspondence is ad-dressed to his brother-in-law. In 1709, Swedenborg presented his thesis, a commentary on some maxims from Latin authors. The presentation of his thesis wasto mark the end of his formal education. In that era it was custom-ary for young men of Swedenborg’s class to take an extensive tour ofEurope upon completing their studies. It was intended that he shouldgo to England, the world’s center of scientific learning at that time,but he was forced by political circumstances to delay this trip. Therewas the disastrous defeat of Sweden’s King Charles XII (1682–1718)by the armies of the Russian czar Peter the Great (1672–1725) atPoltava in 1709. The Danes, who were also at war with Sweden, dom-inated the seas, making passage to England almost impossible. Several months of enforced and unwelcome leisure led Swedenborg to apply to study as a private pupil of ChristopherPolhem (1661–1751), the most respected inventor in Sweden.Although Polhem would become another influence on Swedenborg’searly life, their meeting was delayed for several years by Swedenborg’sdecision to take a ship leaving for England in the summer of 1710. Once safely in London, Swedenbo rg plunged into the current fer- ment of science and technology. He frequented a circle that includedsuch luminaries as Isaac Newton (1642–1727) and Edmond Halley(1656– 1742) and lodged with artisans of various trades to learn their133 Swedenborg’s Inner Journey Opposite: Boardman Robinson.

Swedenborg managed to disarm Flamsteed’ssuspicions and spent a great deal of time with him, observing hismethods and instruments, reporting on them to Swedish scientists inUppsala, and working on the leading scientific question of the time:finding the correct longitude at sea. Swedenborg spent two-and-a-half years in England before mov- ing on to the Netherlands and France to continue his scientific inves-tigations. He turned his mind to inventions of all sorts, and in a 1714letter to Erik Benzelius, he boasts of having plans for inventions in-cluding a submarine, an air gun that could fire a thousand shots atonce, and “a universal musical instrument, whereby the most inex-perienced player can produce all kinds of melodies, these being foundmarked on paper and in notes.” He sent these plans home, but on hisreturn to Sweden at the end of 1714, he found that his father had un-fortunately mislaid them. They have never been recovered. overall swedenborg’s first year at home was one of frustration. He found no professional post. Indeed the only project that bore fruit at this time was the Daedalus Hyperboreus (Northern Daedalus), a sci- entific journal Swedenborg had undertaken to publish. Six issues ofthis periodical would appear between 1716 and 1718. The titleDaedalus was chosen as a compliment to Polhem, and the issues con- tained a number of Polhem’s articles and designs. Upon returning tohis homeland, Swedenborg had fulfilled his ambition of several yearsearlier and made friends with the distinguished inventor, serving forsome time as his assistant. The publication met with the approval ofCharles XII, who was extremely interested in science and technolo-gy, and in late 1716 Swedenborg, in the company of Polhem, madethe monarch’s acquaintance. The king soon became a powerful spon-sor of Swedenborg. At Polhem’s behest, the king offered the youngman a choice of three posts. Swedenborg chose the position of asses-sor extraordinary at the Bergscollegium, or Board of Mines, not onlybecause of his family connections to the mining industry but becauseit offered him the greatest chance of scientific investigation.

Despite his rise in status, this was a time of setbacks for Swedenborg. The death of Charles XII, his royal patron, enabled theBoard of Mines to eliminate Swedenborg’s salary and to keep himfrom being appointed as a full assessor. Although he persistently pro-moted his own case, he did not succeed in getting a full appointmentand salary until 1724. The year 1720 was marked by the death of Swedenborg’s step- mother, and his inheritance from her eventually provided him withfinancial security at a time when he had no job. Swedenborg took an-other trip abroad that lasted from May 1720 to July 1722. During thistime he visited the Netherlands and Germany to gather informationabout mining. On his return, he devoted himself to writing aboutmining, metallurgy, and finance. In 1724, he received his long-await-ed full appointment to the Board of Mines, on which he would servefor the next twenty-five years. in 1728, swedenborg, by now settled in a house of his own in Stockholm, resumed his literary activities, which had been interrupt- ed by more commonplace duties. He began to write his three-volumeOpera Philosophica et Mineralia (Philosophical and MetallurgicalWorks), which would take him five years to complete and which he would publish in 1734. The first volume, titled the Principia Rerum Naturalium (Basic Principles of Nature), constitutes his first major philosophical work. Along with De Infinito (The Infinite), also pub- lished in 1734, it provides the most comprehensive portrait ofSwedenborg’s philosophical thought be fore his visionary experiences began in earnest. In these works, three things stand out as especially noteworthy. The first is Swedenborg’s effort to reason deductively, from first prin-ciples, as well as empirically, from evidence: he contends that both areequally important. This concern reflects one of the great philosoph-ical issues of his era: the relationship between knowledge a priori (which explains phenomena by a system built up from one’s initialintellectual principles) and knowledge a posteriori (which is inferred from observed phenomena). The discussion of these different typesof knowledge would reach its culmination in the major work ofGerman philosopher Immanuel Kant (1724–1804), Critique of Pure Reason (1781). The second is Swedenborg’s concern to relate the in- finite to the finite. His means of doing so is by positing the mathe-matical point, the juncture between the infinite and the finite, as thebasis of all manifest reality: “It is comparable to the two-faced Janus,"

      "text": "seeing in opposite directions simultaneously, each of his two faces turned toward one of the two universes.” The third, and perhaps most distinctive, aspect of this phase of Swedenborg’s work is that he accepts the mechanistic worldview ofthe era, but only to a degree. In Basic Principles of Nature he writes: “The world is mechanical and consists of a series of finite things,which have resulted from the most varied contingencies; . . . the world can accordingly be investigated by experience and with the aid ofgeometry.” But, as he goes on to say, “the infinite cannot be compre-hended by geometry,” nor can the “mental principle in the soul.”Swedenborg asks,“What is this something in the soul, which is noth-ing mechanical, and what are the appropriate means of understand-ing it?” Even at this comparatively early stage of his thought, he isdrawn away from purely scientific in vestigations toward a deeper lev- el of knowledge. like most of swedenborg s writings, Basic Principles of Nature was published abroad—in this case, in Dresden and Leipzig. At this point Swedenborg settled into a pattern that would become standardfor the rest of his life. He would spend some time in his native coun-try, then would depart for extended trips abroad, sometimes lastingthree or four years, to England or the European continent, where hewould publish one or more of his books. This particular journey, last-ing from May 1733 to July 1734, took him to Germany and Bohemia. When Swedenborg returned to Sweden in 1734, he found it in political crisis. There was much agitation for war with Russia to re-gain the territories Sweden had lost under Charles XII. As a memberof the House of Nobles, he drafted a memorandum opposing war onthe grounds that the risks far outweighed any likely gains and that“Russia is indeed more formidable than before.” In July 1736, Swedenborg set out for another trip, which would take him to Rome via Paris,Venice, and Bologna. En route he stoppedin Amsterdam, where he began to write his next major work, theOeconomia Regni Animalis (Dynamics of the Soul’s Domain). The first volume, completed in 1739 and anonymously published in 1740,mainly discusses the heart and the blood, which, Swedenborg said,are “the complex of all things that exist in the world and the store-house ...o fa l l that exists in the body.” The second volume, published in 1741, covers the brain, the nervous system, and the soul. In this work Swedenborg describes an intricate interrelation among the blood, the cerebrospinal fluid, and the “spirituous fluid,”a subtle substance that constitutes the essence of life. He also sets outa view of the structure of the human soul, which, he argues, consistsof a higher, intuitive, spiritual faculty called the anima; the familiar136 Richard Smoley"

      "text": "rational mind, or mens; and the so-called vegetative soul, or animus, which controls vital functions. In a portrait that echoes his later vi- sion of the human soul as a meeting place between the contendingforces of hell and heaven, he describes the mens as divided between the higher, heavenly impulses of the anima, and the coarse physical urges of the animus. The mens is, thus, the battleground on which the struggle of human free will is played out. swedenborg’s project of exploring the entirety of the human body as a vehicle for the soul was interrupted by a radical change in his life’s direction. It was to mark the turning point in his life, and itwould lead him to the vocation for which he would be most remem-bered—that of spiritual visionary and sage. The process was a slow one. Although a devout Christian all his life, Swedenborg had not made religious issues per se the primarysubject of his writing. Instead he had attempted to explore such ques-tions as infinity and the nature of the soul primarily through scien-tific methods. The cleft between science and religion was not as greatin his day as it is in ours. Even at this stage, his views tended towardwhat scholars today would consider an esoteric perspective, thoughsome of his readers might reject that classification. His notion of theanima as set out in Dynamics of the Soul’s Domain, with its intuitive, higher perception of truth, illustrates this tendency. Moreover, this transition in Swedenborg’s intellectual thought appears to have been the result of his own inner experience. We havealready seen how he learned to regulate his psychological statethrough breath control. While writing Dynamics of the Soul’s Domain, he again observed how his breath would spontaneously cease when he was contemplating certain matters. He also referred toresearchers whose conjectures were affirmed by “a certain cheeringlight, and joyful confirmatory brightness ,...a kind of mysterious ra- diation—I know not whence it proceeds—that darts through somesacred temple of the brain.” Scholars have naturally drawn from thisreference the inference that he is speaking of his own experience. Although Swedenborg would later say that his spiritual sight had been opened only in 1745, these early experiences suggest that thisshift began several years before, around 1736. Possibly the death ofhis father the previous year turned his thoughts toward the LastThings. At any rate he began to record his dreams and spiritual expe-riences at this point. Unfortunately, this part of the biographicalrecord is missing. During these years, Swedenborg probably showed few, if any, outward signs of these shifts in his inner orientation: he continuedto travel and work on his books as before.

He resumed work at the Board of Mines and bought ahouse and garden in south Stockholm in March 1743, although hewould not move there until three years later. He left Sweden again inJuly 1743 to complete and oversee the publication of The Soul’s Domain in the Netherlands. It was on this trip that the major events of his spiritual conver- sion took place, a conversion that would bring about great inner up-heaval and transformation.We have an intimate portrait of one phaseof this process in Swedenborg’s Journal of Dreams, which recounts his inner experiences from March to October 1744. These records, inti-mate and often brutally frank, were not published in his lifetime andwere never meant for publication. Despite, or because of this fact,they give us a tremendous amount of insight into this climactic mo-ment in Swedenborg’s life. Here we see classic elements of a religiousconversion combined with highly personal details. At other times, hestruggles between the worldly knowledge that has been his chief pre-occupation up to that point and a higher, more spiritual knowledge. In recent years psychiatrists have come to recognize the “spiritu- al emergency” as a unique psychological category. Although theprocess by which such “emergencies” occur is not well understood,they are common enough. In Christian contexts, as in Swedenborg’scase, they can take the form of intense conversion experiences. It was in the following spring that Swedenborg’s orientation changed definitely and permanently: later he would say that this wasthe time when his spiritual eyes were opened. The incident occurredin April 1745. Swedenborg, dining alone in a private room in aLondon inn, saw and heard a man or an angel telling him not to eattoo much. Then he saw a vapor rising from his body; it settled on thecarpet and turned into worms of various types, which burned upwith a loud pop.“A fiery light then appeared there and a rustling wasaudible,” Swedenborg writes. “It felt as if all the worms produced byan immoderate appetite had been expelled and burnt, and I had beenpurged of them.” In July 1745, Swedenborg returned to his native country and re- sumed work on the Board of Mines. In the spring of the followingyear, he moved into the house he had bought three years earlier,which was located in the southern part of Stockholm. All the whilehe immersed himself in biblical exegesis according to the new under-standing awakened by his spiritual sight. He began by preparing athree-volume Bible index for his own use and proceeded to writesome smaller works.138 Richard Smoley"

      "text": "During this time, Swedenborg seems to have been able to main- tain a connection with the newly discovered spiritual world while in ordinary human company. “I mingled with others just as before,” hewrites, “and no one observed the fact that there was with me such aheavenly intercourse. In the midst of company I have sometimes spo-ken with spirits and with those who were around me. . . .At such timesthey could think no otherwise than that I was occupied with mythoughts.” he also kept up his duties with the board of mines, and when the post of councillor (a higher position than assessor, which was Swedenborg’s title) became vacant, Swedenborg was offered the po-sition. He not only declined, but, in order to devote all his time to hisspiritual studies, he petitioned the king to relieve him of his dutiesand give him a pension equal to half his salary. His request was grant-ed, and, in June 1747, Swedenborg took leave of the institution he hadserved for over thirty years. His intention was to devote his time toan exegesis of scripture. This work eventually took up three folio vol-umes in manuscript; nevertheless, it remained unfinished, andSwedenborg never published it. Most likely Swedenborg changed his mind about this project be- cause he felt it did not give a fully accurate portrayal of the unseenrealities he had begun to encounter. Although the great turning pointof Swedenborg’s life and vision had come in 1744–1745, it appearsthat even after this time he did not understand the full spiritual senseof the scriptures. At least that was his own assessment. By August 1747, however, he makes a note saying, “There was a change of state in me into the heavenly kingdom, in an image.” Someof his followers have interpreted this as meaning that at this point hisintuition was fully awakened to the deepest and most spiritual senseof scripture. He himself pointed out that T he Old Testament Explained contained “the interior historical sense” of Genesis and Exodus, but not the deepest, spiritual sense. His magnum opus,Arcana Coelestia (Secrets of Heaven), begun in December 1748, sets out his version of this spiritual sense. No longer do the stories of thePentateuch merely serve as types for the coming Christian Church,but they apply to the inner life of the individual. The creation accountof Genesis, for example, is seen in Secrets of Heaven 6–52 as a descrip- tion of the regeneration of a human being: it begins in a dark statethat is “without form and void” (Genesis 1:2) and reaches its conclu-sion—the fulfillment of spiritual potentiality—in the creation of ahuman being, “the image and likeness of God” (Genesis 1:26–27). Hidden meanings in scripture—even several hidden meanings, each nested inside the other—have been a recurrent theme in the139 Swedenborg’s Inner Journey"

      "text": "Christian tradition from its beginnings. The earliest examples of al- legorical exegesis of scripture appear in Philo of Alexandria, a Jewishphilosopher who lived at the time of Christ. Following Philo’s lead,the church father Origen (about 185 to about 254) taught that therewere three senses of scripture, corresponding to the spirit, soul, andbody (the tripartite structure of the human being as understood inearly Christianity). In medieval times this was expanded to four dif-ferent levels of meaning (expounded, for example, by Dante[1265–1321] in his Letter to Can Grande. The four-part structure wasalso adopted by the Jewish Kabbalists, who equated them with thefour worlds of Kabbalistic teaching: the physical, psychological, spir-itual, and divine. These ideas were in turn reabsorbed into esotericChristianity. Swedenborg, too, saw three levels of meaning in scrip-ture besides the literal. These considerations lead to what may be the most vexed issue in Swedenborgian scholarship: How did Swedenborg’s ideas relate tothe esoteric and mystical currents of his era, as well as to broadertrends in philosophical and theological thought? Swedenborg himself stressed that his teachings were not influ- enced by human thought. He denied reading works of systematic the-ology both before and after his conversion, insisted on his total un-familiarity with the works of the mystic Jacob Boehme (1575–1624),and condemned the Pietist mystic Johann Konrad Dippel(1678–1734). On the other hand, he must have had at least some fa-miliarity with Philo’s works—of which, as we have seen, Benzeliushad prepared an edition—and his own library contained a numberof works on esoteric topics such as magic, alchemy, and occultism. As often happens, the most sensible conclusion seems to lie in a middle ground. It is unlikely that Swedenborg’s exegesis had no con-nection with esoteric interpretations of the Bible prior to his own; onthe other hand, that does not mean it was derivative of them.Swedenborg certainly had some ideas of the esoteric currents of histime; he is just as likely to have known something of the Kabbalah asa philosopher today would be expected to know something of Zen.On the other hand, Swedenborg was nothing if not a mystic and a vi-sionary, and as his biographer Martin Lamm points out, “The histo-ry of mysticism teaches us that it is neither by their reading northrough personal influences that the gr eat mystics generally realize their mission. On a closer look, one finds that the beginning of theirmystical commitment is more often related to a personal experiencethat they considered to be divine revelation.” Swedenborg certainlyregarded his understanding of the internal sense of the Word as be-ing revealed by the Lord. He did not think it had arisen out of his140 Richard Smoley"

A Life in Two Worlds in the years between 1749 and 1756, Swedenborg lived in obscuri- ty, writing Secrets of Heaven, which was published in London in eight quarto volumes, one volume coming out more or less each year.During this time, he settled into the life that he would lead for the re-mainder of his days. For his first years on his Stockholm property,which covered about an acre, he lived in a small country house heshared with the gardener, the gardener’s wife, and their three daugh-ters. In 1752, he constructed a garden house for his own use. A sim-ple and austere building, it contained a parlor, a bedroom, an or-angerie or conservatory, and a study in which Swedenborg did hiswriting. In later years, Swedenborg’s friend Robsahm would observethat the house “was no doubt comfortable for him, but not for any-one else.” The bedroom was never heated; Swedenborg slept underthree or four English woolen blankets when it was cold. He kept nobooks here except his Hebrew and Greek Bibles and the indices tothem that he had prepared. The study also contained a small stove onwhich he brewed his coffee, which he drank, heavily sugared, in largeamounts throughout the day. Both the orangerie and the garden con-tained a wide range of plants, many of them exotic to Sweden.Swedenborg’s records indicate that he planted chamomile, arti-chokes, and lemons, and that he ordered a variety of rare seeds andplants from the New World, including corn, watermelon, mulberries,dogwood, and beech. As Swedenborg advanced into old age, the physical world seemed to recede from him, and he lived half among humans, half amongspirits. Sometimes he spoke aloud when conversing with spirits, butusually the conversations were conducted in silence. It is clear fromhis descriptions of these encounters that they took place in the realmof the mind—that is, he did not hear them with his physical ears orsee them with his physical eyes. In fact he insists that this is impossi-ble: “We cannot possibly see [heavenly sights] with our physical eyes,but as soon as the Lord opens our inner eyes—the eyes of our spir-it—similar sights can immediately present themselves to view.” These experiences may be best understood by recalling that Swedenborg viewed his journey as an inward one: it was not merelya matter of ascent to the heavens, but of moving deeper within hisown being. Thus, he might well have perceived common impulses,emotions, and sensations as external to himself rather than identify-ing with them, as people ordinarily do.

It takes Swedenborg’s scriptural commentary to the end of Exodus. Although there is some evidence that he intended to offer aspiritual commentary on the whole Bible, he never undertook this ef-fort; the only biblical book that would merit this close attention af-terward was the Revelation of John. In 1758, Swedenborg again ap-peared in London with manuscripts to publish including Heaven and Hell, a meticulous account of the many dimensions of the afterlife, which would become Swedenborg’s most popular work. It presents asuccinct digest of many of the key elements of Swedenborg’s theolo-gy, including his teaching that heaven has the structure of a humanbeing (the maximus homo or universal human); the doctrine ofheavenly marriage,“the union of two people into one mind”that mayoccur in the afterlife; and the idea that the earth is a proving groundfor the human soul, which after death gravitates strictly toward what-ever its ruling passion (a concept sometimes translated “love” or“dominant love”) was in life and, thus, tends toward heaven or to-ward hell, after an interval in the intermediate world of spirits. It is this idea that we move of our own accord toward heaven or hell that represents a key advance in Swedenborg’s teaching, for, un-like conventional Christianity, he stresses that heaven is not a reward,nor is hell a punishment. Rather each place is a suitable home forthose disposed toward it. In ancient Egyptian art the trial of the soulafter death is frequently represented as a weighing of the heart in thescales of good and evil by the gods. Swedenborg’s view is similar, ex-cept that it is the human heart itself that delivers the verdict. Anothercomparable perspective appears in The Tibetan Book of the Dead, in which the soul in the bardo or intermediate realm is led by its desireto choose its next incarnation. Swedenborg’s doctrine differs fromtraditional Buddhist thought, however, inasmuch as it holds that wecan only pass through life once. He rejects reincarnation, an ideaknown in the West since at least the time of Plato. In Swedenborg’s Last Judgment, the earth is not dissolved or the moon turned to blood; the event takes place in dimensions unseen tothe physical eye. But Swedenborg says he was permitted to see thisevent with his spiritual vision. “I was allowed to see all these thingswith my own eyes so that I could testify to them. This Last Judgment started in early 1757 and was completed by the end of that year.” This Last Judgment does not affect the physical world (which re- mains largely unchanged), nor did it radically change Swedenborg’s142 Richard Smoley"

This housecleaning in thespirit world made it possible for human beings on earth to see spiri-tual truths more directly and more “inwardly.” It also created the pos-sibility of a new humankind that would accept and incorporate theseinsights. Swedenborg saw it as his mission to promulgate them. swedenborg did not neglect his more conventional duties. At this time Sweden was in a financial crisis brought about by the war with Prussia, in which Sweden had yet again fared badly. The nation’s lead-ers had adopted a familiar yet ruinous means of dealing with thisproblem: issuing a virtually worthless paper currency. Swedenborgwrote a lengthy paper on the matter, which was presented to theSwedish Diet in November 1760. He argued against the current fis-cal policy and incidentally proposed state regulation of the sale ofliquor, which he believed had brought great harm in Sweden. Thenext year he delivered an address defending Sweden’s limited monar-chy against absolutism. He did not read these addresses himself butsimply presented them as reports. A slight stutter, to which he hadbeen prone all his life, made him shy of public speaking. In these matters, Swedenborg demonstrated his wisdom and clearsightedness, proving that his encounters with the invisibleworlds had not unhinged him mentally. What is perhaps most strik-ing about his political statements is that he makes his arguments inpurely conventional terms—the only kind his colleagues would haveunderstood and appreciated. Had he inserted claims of religious au-thority into these papers, he would have undermined his position,and he clearly knew this. As Swedenborg became more renowned for his visions and teachings about the spirit world, people naturally became curiousabout him. It is from this era that we have the most vivid descriptionsof Swedenborg personally. He was a man of medium height, withclear blue eyes. In demeanor he was polite and good-humored and reluctant to speak about his mystical experiences unless he was di-rectly asked or he believed the person was genuinely interested. Swedenborg spent much time alone, communing with the spir- its and writing, but he generally accepted dinner invitations whenthey were offered and was regarded as pleasant and urbane compa-ny. At home he ate and drank very little apart from enormous quan-tities of coffee; a roll soaked in milk was his principal meal. But whenhe dined out as a guest, he would eat what was served and was notaverse to drinking wine, which, like his coffee, he preferred heavilysugared. Despite the peculiarities of his diet, he generally enjoyed ex-cellent health throughout his life and attributed the minor ailments143 Swedenborg’s Inner Journey"

      "text": "he had to attacks from evil spirits. He kept to his own schedule, sleep- ing and waking as he liked regardless of the hour. He did not requirehis servants to adjust to the eccentricities of his timetable; conse-quently, they found that he required almost no attention at all.During his travels abroad, he kept as much as possible to the samemanner of life. when at home in stockholm, Swedenborg, normally reclusive, be- gan to receive visitors: clergymen interested in his teachings, nobles wanting him to communicate with dead relatives, even children. Aneighbor’s daughter asked him on several occasions to show her anangel, and Swedenborg finally yielded to her request: he led her to acurtain, which he pulled aside to reveal the little girl’s own image re-flected in a mirror. Another visitor, an Englishman named Green, came bearing a letter from one Immanuel Kant asking for Swedenborg’s views on thenature of reality. Swedenborg did not reply directly to Kant. This wasperhaps a tactical mistake, because Kant would publish a book in1766 titled Dreams of a Spirit Seer, mocking and deriding Swedenborg and permanently damaging his reputation in learnedcircles. But Swedenborg had told Green that he was about to publisha book that would answer Kant’s questions. The work he had in mindwas probably Divine Love and Wisdom, published in 1763 (although some say it is the small treatise Soul–Body Interaction, which ap- peared in 1769). And yet the message of Divine Love and Wisdom suggests that Kant’s objections were not merely due to an imagined slight or evento Swedenborg’s claims of mystical knowledge. The essence ofSwedenborg’s teaching is strikingly different from Kant’s. Kantstressed the ultimate unknowability of reality in itself. He contendedthat we experience the world only through categories of experiencesuch as time, space, and causality, and that these are essentially im-penetrable; human understanding cannot go past them. For Swedenborg, reality is ultimately knowable; it is the result of “a constant inflow from the spiritual world into the earthly world.”Knowledge of any kind is made possible only by an emanation ofpower from the Lord, and although the human orientation towardthe material world ordinarily blocks our understanding of higher re-alities, there is nothing that intrinsically prevents us from elevatingourselves to those levels. We are impeded not so much by the limitsof our minds as by the limits we place on love: “The reason we do notbecome rational to the highest degree we are capable of is that ourlove, which is a matter of our intent, cannot be raised up in the sameway as our wisdom, which is a matter of our discernment.

      "text": "that is a matter of intent is raised only by abstaining from evils as sins and then by those good actions of thoughtfulness that are acts ofservice, acts that we are then performing from the Lord.” Althoughthese ideas may sound unusual, they resonate with an ancient teach-ing that true wisdom cannot be isolated as a mere intellectual phe-nomenon. The wise individual must also be a good individual. Assessment the story of swedenborg ’s influence extends beyond the limits of this essay. Although at one point he estimated that he could countsome fifty people who accepted his teachings, soon his followerswould assemble themselves into a new denomination. His legacy ex-tends much further than the New Church, of course, and can be seenin the work of such seminal figures as William Blake (1757–1827),Honoré de Balzac (1799–1850), and Charles Baudelaire (1821–1867). T o take only one example, the entire Symbolist movement innineteenth-century art was inspired by Baudelaire’s sonnet“Correspondences”—a poem that was in turn inspired bySwedenborg’s teachings. Swedenborg’s most profound legacy is perhaps one that remains largely untapped. More than most, his life has an architectonic struc-ture to it. On the one hand, it encompasses an ascent from an inves-tigation of the mineral kingdom to one of the plant and animalrealms. When Swedenborg began the age-old quest for the link be-tween the soul and the body, he had to go past reason and rise intothe unseen dimensions of the spirit. On the other hand,Swedenborg’s journey was also one toward the interior of the self andof the universe. He started at the outward surface of things—withminerals and technology—and went inward to explore humananatomy before reaching the inmost essence of things, which is spir-itual and invisible. richard smoley is the author of several books, including Forbidden Faith: The Gnostic Legacy from the Gospels to The Da Vinci Code; Inner Christianity: Hidden Wisdom: A Guide to the Western Inner Traditions (with Jay Kinney), and The Essential Nostradamus.

Neither man said it, but we knew that this must be the last sight we should have of Mr. Blake. We had learned that his time now wasa question not of days but hours. Outside the building we found no decorous silence of respect or mourning. In the street the children were at their usual play; it was asthough the man and woman within had made known their wish thatit might be so. And as we came to the door, a swoop of swallows wasabout our heads, rushing, irreverent. The customary quiet after the door had closed behind us seemed to partake of a different quality. Now it struck us as a dead calm. Had the spirit of the place already departed? No sound reached us from the rooms above, no sound of industry, of busy engravingtool on metal plate. Not even the rustle of paper. we had not long to wait, however, before Mrs. Blake descended, thanking us for coming, as though just another visit. Her calm bear- ing set an example for the hours ahead. After a few words she led usup to the doors of the two rooms that were their whole residence. We entered the front room where his drawings and frescoes were all about us. This rear chamber oversaw the river and, a few yards be-hind, the roaring Strand. Despite ourselves our hearts were lifted.Everywhere his prints hung still on cord lines and walls of this work-shop home: the large sheets of his vision, bright as lilies of the field,the fruits and blossoms of his unremitting labours. There was a hushed conversation with Mrs. Blake. She explained, before we entered where he lay, that her husband was quite at peace,experiencing no discomfort, no pain. Indeed, she seemed more in-tent upon reassuring us than on any anxiety of her own that she her-self must have been undergoing. So we found him on his bed, un-moving, his eyes closed, face serene. And now she was at his side again, Kate, more than excellent cook, more than cheerful, she shared with him in other things—ofbelief, of shared visions, nurturing visions of her own.

T o the last hours, one might see in him still the boy that wan- dered London’s fields or worked with such intent among the greatmodels he was set to copy in Westminster Abbey. Proud to be a Sonof Labour yet he was, too, a faithful Son of Liberty, and no mere talk-er, neither: his personal warning it was that had saved Paine’s life. Nor had these majestic, grand perceptions been lightly won. His was no aloof existence of tranquil vision, but one that was real andpassionate.

We were in the midst of a world, a uni-verse of his making: Job, Flea and Tyger were the pictures of ourminds. He who beheld whole Worlds in grains of sand, discovered Heavens in the wild flower—he who had instructed us how hu-mankind was made for joy and woe together, had lived his days con-tinually in Eternity’s sunrise, being in himself Imagination entire. While the lilywhite shall in love delight, Nor a thorn, nor a threat, stain her beauty bright— Though his eyes were often open in the passage of these hours, we supposed them to be fastened on larger sights than ourselves or his near surroundings.

More than once, it seemed such respite had only been to regath- er his forces in order to break forth once more in fresh utterance.Until these intervals increased their length and he lapsed into a si-lence of such duration that we could not but suppose it to be the lastof all. Scarcely he breathed. Both life and death mingled with the di-vine future he had always looked to with such expectation. This hap-py fusion was surely no more than he had known and practiced.

His wife stood so serenely by, and he sang his love for her: Love to faults is always blind; Always is to joy inclin’d— Not for the first or last time in these hours were we made calm by his conduct. By hers also, as she, yet at his side, joined hands with him. His voice thin, yet clear, he sang of his London also: —The fields from Islington to Marybone To Primrose Hill and Saint John’s Wood— Sang his Vision of the City: builded over with pillars of gold;And there Jerusalem’s pillars stood Sang of London’s People: —The hum of multitudes was there,but multitudes of lambs— Y es, not least he hymned her innocent, poor children: —Thousands of little boys and girlsraising their innocent hands. . . Cheerily he sang of youth – yes, lustily: —Let age and sickness robThe vineyards in the night;But those who burn with vigorous youthPluck fruits before the light—! He sang of his high art, all of it executed within confines of their retreat: all of it true to his fierce assertion how: Great things are done when men and mountains meet;This is not done by jostling in the street No more than a hint of shadow in the fading light, swallows passed the window, gathering for long flight. A while later he opened his eyes for the last time, and, not singing, but speaking, he said: Sweet Mercy leads me on With soft repentant moan:I see the break of day . . . And, truly, we believed him! When we left, this emotion, more of rejoicing than any dejection, persisted in us, filling minds and spirits. Chins raised, eyes uplifted,151 Mr. Blake Sings"

In our mind’s eye we saw, too, those rich images—of Flea and Tyger, of Job, of the Almighty, of the human form divine—represen-tations that daily visited him, that divinely entered the great imagi-nation of this unique man. So, some of the sadness we had earlier felt was now relieved. Or, rather, mixed with other emotio ns, not least, of hope, of resolution— of a courage renewed even. We went from there, back into the world of men as giants re- freshed. We left behind the tranquil backwater of our good friend, yetstill it marched with us, and our steps were light. We marched, andbefore long, with no evident signal to each other, we broke intosong—there, in the public street—to the astonishment of bystandersand passers-by, repeating those lines the master had given us. Y es.Y es—lustily! —Rouse—Rouse up, Rouse up, O Young Men—Young MenOf this New Age—! Postscript On the following Friday of that August, Mr. Blake was interred at theBunhill Fields burying ground in Finsbury. Calvert, Richmond,Tatham, and others were in that party which accompanied him onthat last earthly journey. With the city’s traffic noise around, here wascompany worthy of such a giant. Good dissenting fellowship. Forclose at hand lay Bunyan, Defoe, and other fellowship. So we left him there. tony weeks-pearson has written a number of novels during and after twenty years of teaching high-school English. “Mr. Blake Sings” is from the author’s recent short-story collection; the debt to Gilchrist’s classic biogra-phy is evident.

      "text": "vincent decarolis Recliner it came over leon one afternoon that he ought to buy a chair, something new to sit in while he read and took notes. He already had one, a serviceable chair made of oak with a red corduroy seat. ButLeon had recently retired from teaching and was enamored with theidea of finding something new in which to sit out the later years ofhis bookish life. After consulting with his wife, it was resolved that theold chair would go to the basement until it ended up with his daugh-ter in Vermont. She was the collector in the family. She had a barn. Leon set out the next morning to search for something new. He went alone, having told his wife he’d been looking forward to aleisurely prowl through the various stores and shops. At first she re-sisted, fearing that, without her, he was sure to return with somethingthat did not fit the general scheme of things. What saved him fromher supervision was that the chair would reside in Leon’s study, aroom truly his and not, therefore, subject to her decorator’s eye. His first stop was a place that seemed to feature recliners.“Is there anything I can show you?”asked a young woman in a blazer and plaidskirt. Overwhelmed by the odor of fresh upholstery, Leon did not ac-tually hear her. Vertigo set in as he scanned the vast floor of loungers.Lines of them rolled away like ocean waves. He reeled, trying to lo-cate himself and then fixed his eye on a leather model behind whicha man of glossy cardboard stood, pointing to the chair. “Who’s that?” he inquired.“Who’s who?” she replied.“The man behind the chair.” He pointed to a life-size mockup.“Oh . . . him?” By now, Leon had regained his bearings and was amused that she didn’t know. Neither did he, but then he’d left hisglasses in the car. She called to a young man in a white shirt and tiestanding far away. “Jerry…” He squinted in their direction. “Who’sthis cardboard guy that you put behind the black Swivel-Glide?” 155"

The saleswoman followed. “No, this isn’t Perry Como,” he said. “It isn’t?”“Absolutely not.”She was growing impatient. “Well, is there something else? Perhaps a chair I could show you?” She gestured with a graceful wave. “Y es . . . a chair,” he said, still fixed on the cardboard man endors- ing the black Swivel-Glide. “Y ou know, I don’t know who this is ei-ther, but it isn’t Perry Como, that’s for sure.” “Doesn’t matter,” she said. “Want to try it out?”“This one?” Leon asked. She’d taken him by surprise. Until then, he’d never even considered such a chair. “It’s our top-of-the-line lounger,” she began.“It’s real leather but treated so that all you have to do is wipe it with a moist cloth no mat-ter what gets spilled on it.” Leon considered the chair, tried to imag-ine it in his little room. He knew his wife would object at first. “I wasn’t really thinking of one like this.”“Go ahead,” she said softly. Something in her manner, perhaps the way she encouraged him, caused Leon to think of his daughter. “I didn’t get your name,” he said gently.“Jill,” she replied, putting a finger to the tag pinned on the lapel of her blazer. “ O fc o u r s e ...J i l l ... ”H e smiled and settled into the sumptuous lounger. “Oh my . . . this is elegant, isn’t it?” “Now just reach down there ...o n y our right . . .” Leon found the handle she was referring to, pulled it back, and watched his feet come up. Sudden embarrassment overtook him ashe realized how scuffed the toes of his shoes were. Shopping for alounger requires a shine, he observed as the back and seat began tovibrate. “This switch controls the massage,” she said, holding a smallcontrol box. She offered it to him. “Just dial the amount you want.”Leon took it with nervous interest but did not alter the setting. “I imagine this could be quite relaxing.”“Depends on the customer,”she said.“Some people prefer the ba- sic chair. It can save you about two hundred dollars if you buy thechair without it. But either way you’re getting a lot of chair.” Leonpassed the control box back to her. She turned it off. “Either way . . .” he repeated. Behind him, he could feel the flat man looming. Just who was he? It vexed Leon that he didn’t know,that nobody seemed to know. He let his feet down and got up.“A very"

I guess, in the back of my mind, I was looking for a chair I could use at my desk.” “Ah . . .” she said. “I’m sorry to say we only stock loungers. That’s what we’re about . . . loungers ...r e c liners.” “So I see.” Leon surveyed the floor as if to confirm it.“I wonder if an office-supply store would be more what you’re looking for.” She spoke helpfully, but to his surprise Leon found thathe did not like the sound of that. Maybe it wasn’t a new chair that hewanted after all. Maybe it was a second chair that he’d come lookingfor, a second one that, unconsciously, he’d been wanting all along? “What’s the price of this leather one minus the vibrating fea- ture?” he asked. “Let’s see . . .” she said mirroring his reversal perfectly.“Minus the massage it’s . . . I’ll have to check to be sure.” She went over to the deskwhere she consulted a notebook and then came back with it open,studying the figures as she did. “The Swivel-Glide in black, no mas-sage . . . thirteen-ninety-nine . . . but I can let it go for . . . nine-nine-ty-nine. So you’re saving four hundred dollars.” “And you have one in stock?”“The book says we’ve got four, two without the massage, two with.” “I do like it,” he said. She made no reply, preferring to let silence force the moment.“Y ou’ve got a deal,” he said.“But only if you throwthe display in with it.” “The display?”“Him,” Leon said, pointing to the cardboard man smiling beside the recliner. “Y ou want Perry Como thrown in?”“That isn’t Perry Como,” Leon reminded her.“Well, whoever it is . . .” she said, struggling to preserve her sangfroid. “If you’ll excuse me, I’ll have to run this by Jerry.” Leon nodded and watched her go. Jerry lowered his head and listened.When she came back smiling, Leon knew they had a deal. leon’s wife was working in a flower bed when he pulled into the driveway. When she heard the mini-van’s door close, she planted her trowel in the earth and turned to wave. There was her husband walk-ing toward the house with a life-size silhouette tucked under his arm. “Leon!”“Y es dear?”“What are you doing?”“Going into the house?”“I mean with that . . . thing.” She moved quickly. “What is it, for heaven’s sake?”"

She went around to see what he might be getting at. “Did you find a chair?” “Sure did. A real beauty,” he told her. She was torn between holding back the cardboard man who was about to enter her home and going over to the van to see what herhusband had bought. “I didn’t expect you to find something so quickly,” she said.“Neither did I, but I fell in love with the first one I tried.”“Sounds like us,” she quipped. Leon would have smiled, but he was positioning himself just then to angle the man in head first.“Would you hold the screen, Dear?” “Where do you think you’re going with that?”“My room,” he said confidently.“For how long?” she inquired.“I don’t know . . . until I figure out who he is, I guess.”“I hope you do, Leon. We can’t have that thing in the house.”“Then I’ll put it the garage.”“We can’t have it in the garage, either.”“Why not?”“People will see it when the door goes up.”“So what?”“Leon!” She followed him down the hall to his study where he dragged the cardboard man to a far corner and set him up. “I wantyou to keep the door to this room closed until you’re finished withhim. Is that clear, Leon?” “Does he bother you that much?”“ H e ’ d ...b other anyone ...w ith that smile and . . . cheap suit.” “Come on, Rose. I admit the suit’s a little shiny, but he’s got a pleasant face.” She considered his observation. It was always like this.After the initial shock, she’d catch a little of Leon’s fire and grow in-terested herself. “He does look familiar, doesn’t he?” she said.“The kids at the furniture store didn’t know who he was either. One of them thought he was Perry Como!” “No!”“And then the other one, the young lady who actually sold me the chair? I don’t think she even knows who Perry Como was.” “Well . . .” Rose considered it in her usual, balanced way. “How old was she?” “About the same age as Elizabeth.”“I guess that’s no surprise then.”158 Vincent DeCarolis Opposite: Baby in Red Chair.

This state is so full of delight that it overflowsevery concept of delight. It is not just the ending of stuggle but is a lifethat comes from a more inward peace, moving the outer person inways beyond description. Then truths of faith and good gifts of loveare born that draw their life from the delight of peace. —emanuel swedenborg, secrets of heaven, 92 Part II: Breaking Out The issue in our [deeper] trials is whether the evil will gain controlthat is in us from hell or the good that is in us from the Lord. The evilthat wants control is in the natural or outer person, while the good isin the spiritual or inner person. As a result, even in our trials, the issueis the control of one over the other. If the evil wins, then the naturalperson controls the spiritual; if the good wins, then the spiritual per-son controls the natural. —emanuel swedenborg, secrets of heaven, 8961 Part III: Sea Changes [When we are being reborn] our first state is a tranquil one; but as weare making the passage into the new life, we pass also into a state ofdisturbance. The evil and false things we have absorbed in the past arecoming out . . . and disturbing us, eventually with such force that weare caught in trials and harassments by the hellish crew, which is try-ing to destroy the state of our new life. Still, at the deepest level, wehave a state of peace. Unless this were at our deepest level, we wouldnot fight. We are actually focusing on it as our goal throughout thestruggles we are involved in, and unless it were our goal, we would nothave the energy or the strength to fight. —emanuel swedenborg, secrets of heaven, 3696.2 Part IV: The Big Ticket [Swedenborg takes the six days of creation as symbolic of six successivestages of spiritual growth.

      "text": "The first state is the one that precedes—both the state from infancy and the state just before rebirth. It is called void, emptiness, and dark- ness. And the first motion, which is the Lord’s mercy, is the spirit ofGod hovering over the face of the water. The second state is one in which a distinction is made between the things that are the Lord’s and the things that belong to the person. The things that are the Lord’s are called “The remnants” in the Word andare primarily insights of faith that have been learned from infancy.These are stored away and do not surface until the person reaches thisstate, which rarely happens nowadays without trial, misfortune, or de-pression, which deaden the physical and worldly concerns that aretypically human. In this way, the concerns of the outer person areseprated from those of the inner. The remnants are in the inner per-son, stored away there by the Lord for this time and for this use. The third state is one of repentance, in which the individual, from the inner person, does talk reverently and devoutly and does bringforth good [actions] that resemble deeds of compassion. Still, they arenot really alive because they are thought to be done independently.They’re called the tender plant, the seed-bearing plant, and, finally,the fruit tree. The fourth state occurs when the individual is moved by love and enlightened by faith. Before this, the person did indeed talk reverentlyand bring forth good [actions]—but out of a state of trial and con-straint, not out of faith and compassion. So now faith and compassionare kindled in the inner person and are called the two great lights. The fifth state is the one in whch the individual talks from faith, and consequently, strengthens his or her devotion to what is true and good. The things now brought forth are alive and are called the fish ofthe sea and the birds of the air. The sixth state occurs when the person says what is true and does what is good from faith, and therefore, from love. The things now brought forth are called the living soul and the animals. And since theindividual is then beginning to act from both faith and love, he or shebecomes a spiritual person, who is called an image [of God]. The spir-itual life of such a person is delighted and nourished by things relatedto insights of faith and to deeds of compassion, which are called“food,” and the natural life is delighted and nourished by things relat-ed to the body and the senses. This results in conflicts until love gainscontrol, and the person becomes heavenly. Not all people who are being reborn reach this state. Some—most people nowadays—reach only the first; some, only the second. Somereach the third, fourth, and fifth; few, the sixth; and hardly anyone,the seventh. —emanuel swedenborg, secrets of heaven, 6‒13162 Part Pages"
