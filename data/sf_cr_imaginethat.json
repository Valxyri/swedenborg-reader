Using thin rice-based rubbing paper, drafting tape, and everlasting patience for human traffic, J. Tully Watsonpainstakingly made large, 24x36-inch rubbings of the building plaques: five of the rubbings are reproducedon the cover and part pages. These buildings are General Electric (1930), Fred F. French (1927), Chrysler(1929), Lincoln (1930), and Citicorp Center (1978). According to the artist, “After spending countless hourscrouching on a busy sidewalk, I experienced a sensory overload from seeing thousands of people rushing by,sounds of cars, subways, and pedestrians, the smells of exhaust, garbage, food, and smoke, feeling the dirtygrime of the sidewalk sometimes accompanied by scalding heat, and the taste of my own sweat mixed with the thick, stale New Y ork City air.” The rubbings in this issue represent other worlds, other times,and countless footsteps. publisher’ s statement The Chrysalis Reader is a journal of spiritual discovery published in honor of Emanuel Swedenborg,eighteenth-century scientist, civil engineer, and mystic, who used his scientific orientation to explore theworld of spirit. Respectful of all lives lived according to faith in the divine, Swedenborg described the ever-present reality of the spiritual world. Individuals who have responded to Swedenborg’s ideas with great energy can be found in the arts, especially in literature and painting, as well as in psychology and the social sciences. The Swedenborg Foundation cele brates and furthers this Swedenborgian connection with the arts with the Chrysalis Reader and the annual Bailey Prize for literature. _______________ Publication of the Chrysalis Reader is partially funded by a bequest from Esther Blackwood Freeman (Mrs. Forster Freeman Jr.).The Chrysalis Reader is published annually in the fall.

      "text": "editor’ s note: robert f. lawson Portal to Abyssinia we seldom have chances to sample foreign worlds. When we step out of our everyday worlds, do we discover possibilities we would never have expected? Imagine, for instance, a young boy exploring aspacious house in Belfast, Maine, where he finds the treasures of agreat-uncle who returned to America after years abroad. Near the topof a grand staircase, mounted on wood-paneled walls, are two oblongAfrican shields and a pair of crossed spears. Guarding the landing isthe tawny, black-striped fur of a tiger skin. Its head rises from the par-quet floor in a perpetual snarl. Other mementos from a long career in the diplomatic service cover walls, tables, and desks. A young prince with a dark beard andmoustache and curly black hair stares regally from a framed picture.There are signed photographs of U.S. presidents from McKinley to FDR; a group picture taken at the American Club of Paris, 1924, the men dressed in formal tail coats and white vests; a picture of Greeksoldiers marching in regulation pleated skirts, white stockings, andtasseled shoes in front of the American embassy in Athens; and theboy’s favorite: an architectural chart showing some of the world’smost noted buildings as of 1927, placed side by side—including theEiffel T ower, Karnak, the Pyramid of Cheops, and the WoolworthBuilding. The boy, this editor, is called downstairs for dinner and is seated at one end of a very long dining table. A crystal goblet of milk awaitson his right. Then an unusual meal ensues on beautiful plates withgold edging. One item is served at a time—green beans cut in halfand on the diagonal, mashed potatoes baked in their skins, meat cutin slivers with a white sauce. Afterward, lemon tarts.

      "text": "deed. His great, great-uncle Rob, retired diplomat, first American ambassador to Abyssinia (now called Ethiopia) in 1903, sits at theother end of the table, barely visible in the dim light, his bald headbowed as he eats. There are so many questions I want to ask: Tell me about the spears. Were you on safari? Did you shoot the tiger? Who is the dark-haired prince? Did you meet Tarzan? Y ears later I will understand the importance of Uncle Rob’s mis- sion to Ethiopia to establish trade relations for the U.S. I will be fas-cinated by his friendship with the prince Ras Tafari, heir to thethrone. But most of all I will admire my uncle’s model of wise diplo-macy, allowing a young boy from the Midwest to visit him, allowingme to move between different worlds, honoring the cultures of each. Y et at a primal level, I was transported to the heartbeat of Africa as I knelt before the gleaming yellow eyes of the tiger, as I traced withmy finger the blood-red pattern on one of the shields, as I met thegaze of the future king, who would change his name to Emperor HaileSelassie. I did not need to know his name. His imperial look saideverything, and the allure of Africa has stayed with me ever since. Imagine That! Breaking Through to Other Worlds provides portals to worlds that surround us and are within us. This collection of fic-tion, non-fiction, and poetry illustrates that we each live a double lifewith one foot in the natural and the other in the spiritual world.Imagine That! explores this multi-dimensional force field. We discov- er that travel agents among us may appear suddenly, providing un-expected breakthroughs or unwanted intrusions. In such a fluid state, time and space may melt away. As Swedenborg points out from his experiences, concepts of time are re-placed by spiritual states in the next life. Likewise, in a heavenly worldwhose sun, moon, and stars correspond directly to the influx of thedivine, the quality of light and heat depends on one’s receptivity. Andsince no one is perfect, no matter which world we are in, accordingto Swedenborg, even angels have their dark days! One writer in this issue on other worlds entertains the paradox that opposites need each other to exist. He concludes that without theinner tension of doubts to test one’s beliefs, our spiritual life wouldbecome hard and brittle. Another writer reexamines, thirty years af-ter the fact, his interview of a woman who claimed to have been ab-ducted by aliens. Ultimately, for the emerging spirit in each of us,Imagine That! highlights the importance of love and compassion, en- abling us to embrace the varieties of existence—both the here andnow and the hint of something more—reminding us that as fellowtravelers, we are indeed not alone in the universe.x Robert F.

He wore a moth-eaten jersey, black cycling shoes with cobbledcleats, and a cycling beret with the brim upturned. It took us an hourto fix his chain. As dusk pushed from the horizon, I struggled to over-come a primal instinct to be settled, and could remember no town inthis part of Algeria large enough for a hotel. No one knew where Iwas. I had ridden into a dead end. Two weeks before, I had reached Sicily, bought a map of North Africa, and ridden down to the port of Palermo for the recommend-ed shots. Biceps aching, I limped through the final European miles toTrapani, departure point for Tunisia. In Tunis, I watched men spitinto the sawdust of café floors while waiting three days for an Algerianvisa. An incredulous consular officer at the U.S. embassy informedme that I was only registering my body, if found. I had no itinerary,no form of communication, and no backup plan. I did not knowwhether I would find bike parts, even tires, in Africa.

I also was afraid ofsomeone stealing my bike because everything I had might be morethan they would ever have. Every puncture repair or derailleur ad-justment drew a crowd of hands shifting and searching. Everythingwas touched many times, including me. Ahmed and I rode through the dark, side-by-side into his village. He wheeled my bike down an alley and returned carrying my pan-niers and handlebar bag. He was wearing my sweatshirt. “On y va,”he said. He took me to the village’s public baths, whose faded colo-nial glory was heartbreaking. The larger tiled tubs were empty,mildewed, and chipped. Everything reeked of clogged drains andsteam. I was handed a threadbare towel and a sliver of soap and di-rected into a stall. Mercifully, it had a raised wooden floor, for a mu-cosial soup swirled below. The showerhead hiccupped, shuddered,and spit lukewarm water. It was one of the best showers I have everhad. I had miles in my legs and food on my mind, but for the next two hours I sat in a café nibbling potato chips and drinking phosphores-cent green soda, meeting every male inhabitant of the village. I diplo-matically voiced my concern about a hotel, but Ahmed announcedthat I would be staying with him. “I have your bike,” he said, laugh-ing. He thumped his fist on the table and said, “On y va.” Ahmed’s mother served us a huge platter of nuts, blood oranges, olives, green beans, flat bread, and sauces of cumin, coriander, papri-ka, mint, and fennel. Ahmed and I lounged on the carpet, eating withour hands. His mother was the first woman I had seen since leavingEurope, and I only saw her face. I was not to see another woman un-til I reached Spain. That night, Ahmed insisted that I take his bed, which was wide, with clean sheets and wool army blankets. Other nights I had slept infields, on a high table behind an abattoir and a mountain of bleachedgoat bones, or on a sea of mattresses scattered across the flat roof ofa youth hostel, where I awoke in the small hours to see others pray-ing, the tape-recorded muezzin wailing from gray speaker-hornslashed to minarets across the skyline. I was delighted to have a bed.Ahmed was delighted that I was delighted. In the middle of the night, however, I realized I was covered by bed bugs. I tore the covers away and switched on the light. The beau-ty of bedbugs is that they vanish when the host is no longer offeringa blood meal. I turned out the light and lay down, but not thirty sec-onds later they raced onto my body. I was up dancing a jig, shooingshiny bugs onto the floor. Some were swollen, reddish-brown.Ahmed slept soundly on the floor.xiii Ahmed"

So, I returned to bed to offer my flesh to the bugs, and the next morning my body was a horror of red spots.The following night I retrieved my sleeping bag from my bike downthe alley and burrowed deep into it, sweating and gasping for air. Soon, I literally itched to be on my way, setting my own agenda. But Ahmed would not let me go until he had arranged a relay offriends, and friends of friends from other cycling clubs, stretchingwestward for three days and 300 miles along the coast, until the daisychain dwindled to a final rider who seemed thankful when I relievedhim of an obligation originating from where he did not know. Afterthe last rider had gone, I threw my infested sleeping bag in a ditch andset it on fire. Three days later, I found myself crossing a mountain pass on an exhausted road, the shoulder plasticized into washboard by long-haul trucks. One by one the spokes of my rear wheel popped. Istopped to loosen the brake. Then I stopped to remove the rear fend-er. Two hours later, I removed the brake entirely and wrapped itaround the seat post. My wheel gyrated up and down, left and right,and I began to wonder how few spokes a wheel could have and stillbe a wheel at all.

Mushy hailstones of sand slammed the roadlike fists. I waited under a bridge over a dry stream bed until a slurryof mud and sticks rose around my ankles. I returned to the road, butcouldn’t see more than a few feet. I pushed my bike along, shoe cleatsslipping on the pavement. A hailstone smacked into my shoulder andslush ran down my back. T o my left I saw a faint electric bulb andpushed my bike up a dirt road into a muddy courtyard before a cor-rugated iron shack. I yelled for help again and again, and then hearda faint, “Içi, içi.” I pushed my bike ahead through a small door andconfronted a wild-eyed old man in baggy pants wielding a hot pok-er. Two women in chador cowered behind him. He jabbed and jabbedthe poker in my face until I retreated. I found cover under a low shed,rain and hail pounding the roof.

I apologized over and over to my hosts, tried to explain my tears, myfears, and the need to continue before dark. That night, I slept in afield beneath the cosmic smear of the Milky Way. The next day I pushed on to Algiers. I had the wild idea that if I could find the city’s velodrome, someone there could repair my RubeGoldberg wheels. I eventually found it and was ushered under thestands by a gaggle of cyclists who presented me to their septuagenar-ian leader. He clucked his tongue at my shabby bike and lifted it ontohis repair stand, then regaled us with stories of victories—hardfought and at long odds—and defeats—luckless and méchantes—atthe hands of the French on the track above us. He measured the rim’swobble with a greasy thumb and then measured spoke tension like aharp by dragging the same thumbnail along the spinning spokes.“Allez!” he announced, “Finis!” He declined my offer of money withoutstretched arms because no amount of anything could compensatefor sixty years in the saddle. Dusk had come; it was too late to accepthis offer of a spin on a borrowed track bike. So I rode off, humbledagain. By week’s end, I was near Melilla, the Spanish port city on the north coast of Morocco, one of Spain’s remaining outposts in Africa.The city is claimed by Morocco, but Spain likes to thumb its nose atthe Arab world thirteen centuries after the Moorish invasion. By now,I had reduced my diet to coffee, croissants, sardines, bread, foil-wrapped cheese segments, baked chicken, and liters and liters ofphosphorescent green soda. My body weight had dropped from 190to roughly 175 pounds. My delay in Ahmed’s village had probablycost me five pounds, afraid as I was of eating so many things. I wasconstantly hungry, but never sure whether or not the food would killme. It almost did.That evening, as a cuticle moon rose over the central square in Berkane, Morocco, I ate two lamb kebabs from a roadside stall. When I awoke the next morning, I suspected already that I might need medical care. The final leg into Spain was the longest sixty milesof my life, during which I consumed only Pepsi, a welcome enoughchange after a month of green soda. At dinner time, I felt much bet-ter and had a beer, then another, and met a couple of Scottish engi-neers taking a break from the Algerian oil fields. I splurged on a mealof pasta, steak, red wine, and flan. The next thing I remember, I wasstaggering out of control down the sidewalk, pleading with passers-by in English to help me.

I awoke back in the restaurant, with my head in a puddle of vom- it and someone asking me, “Ar yall raite, mate?” My new best friendsfrom the oil fields took me to the local hospital where I was offeredan alternative: a three-week course of tiny pills or an injection fol-lowed by seven horse pills that would make me wish I were dead, butcure me faster. I took the injection and put the seven horse pills in my pocket.I checked into a cheap hotel and for the next week alternatively huddled in bed, wrapped in sheets and blankets, or spread-eagled onthe tile floor with fever. Several times each day I would crawl nakedacross the corridor into the communal shower, where I would sit onthe floor, scrape dried vomit and feces from my body, and push itdown the drain. Once each day, the kind owner of the hotel wouldcollect the sheets and drop off new ones outside my door. TheMoroccan lamb kebabs were teaching me how many holes I had inmy body. Fluid even drained from my ears. On the seventh day I wob-bled to my feet, went downstairs to a café for a croissant, then a sliceof empanada. The next day, I took the ferry to Almeria, Spain. My ride ended in tears on a climb east of Almeria. I simply did not have the strength to turn the bike crank another rotation. I sawtears drop on my handlebars and soak into the filthy tape. I felt I wasabandoning the T our, forced to give up my number and ride in thebroom wagon. I turned my bike downhill to the city’s train station. A week and a French rail strike later I was back in Italy. I weighed 145 pounds. A friend broke down and cried when she saw me. Riding alone across Algeria was one of the most important, stu- pid things I have ever done in a life filled with stupid things that I havedone. I learned generosity from Ahmed, from a poker-wieldinggrandfather, from a forgotten champion, from Scottish roughnecks,and from a widowed hotel keeper abandoned on the wrong continent. Any friend can knock on my door at 3 AMwith suitcase in hand and stay for a year. An Albanian refugee and her infant son once did,but that is another story.

I slow down, which makes it harder to ignore the mansions, each more flagrant than the last. “What do you think of these houses?” I ask José.“I think these houses are like oranges, lemons, and limes, and I think they are like grapefruit.” I look in the rearview mirror, and José smirks. He knows I will have to ask him to explain. He’s clearly got my number. “Y ou knowyou’ll have to stay in the car during the funeral,” I say, “and then wego to the cemetery, and you’ll have to wait again.” “This thing will not be a problem for me.”It won’t, either, I think.“Y ou sure know a lot of dead people,” José says.“Huh?”I’m still working on the house–citrus analogy, which I ex- pect will blow the lid off conspicuous consumption as filtered through the perceptions of this nine-year-old migrant philosopher, eventhough I know he’ll give me some crazy, goofball explanation. I alsowant to know what José means by “all my dead friends,” but this kid’slife has been so grisly that there are only about three questions thatdo not lead directly down some trail strewn with the stuff of night-mares. Besides, it just hit me: he thinks that all the funerals I do arefor my pals. “I do the funerals for money,” I tell him. José knows more about me than my shrink, way more than my confessor. “How many dollars do the dead people pay?”“Depends.” I say. “Not much. Some fifty or a hundred bucks. Once it was $250, once $300.” José whistles. “This is work my family will like to do, I think.”His reaction makes me ponder. I realize if a whole family picks peaches in New Jersey—the crop that is the best-kept secret in theU.S.—it would take a day for mother, father, and two sons to make ahundred dollars. José goes on, “Do you need this raiment to get money from the dead ones?” Raiment? It takes me a minute to tumble to the New T estamentese. It’s Bible talk for clothes. Half of José’s words have notbeen said aloud outside a church since 1600. José and his family cometo my church. They sit near the front, José with a pen and paper tak-ing furious notes. He’s a word freak. He collects bits and pieces of ourlanguage the way other kids might stockpile swears. José asks the question a different way. “What raiment does my family need?” “Well, it’s not the clothes so much as the training,” I answer.5 And Not as a Stranger"

All José has to do is crawl into my backseat to make my life look idiotic. José pauses and asks, “And to take all the money at the 7-12?”José calls the 7-11 on the corner by the church the 7-12. I swear to God he’s got the most keenly-honed sense of irony this side of theAtlantic. “The 7-12 university is how many days?” asks José.“Zero,” I respond.José is incredulous. “When someone works in this place, 7-12, where they bring in new food every seven hours, and people you don’teven know their names before, come in to give you money and thewalls are lined with candy, and that is zero days of university for this?But if you want to wear this dress and wave your hands to make themen drop boxes of dead people into the ground, it is 1,000 days ofschool and 400 days and 60? I do not think my family will be doingthis work at all.” I consider explaining to him how it wasn’t my plan either, how my inner-city parish is a sinkhole, how the bishop is a dope, and howI myself am not paid enough to live on, working as it’s called, half-time. I couldn’t make the payments on this car were it not for aboutfourteen different undertakers who have my name and number pen-ciled beside their heavy, black, smelly telephones, to call me—a wholelot more often than you’d think—to do funerals for people who havespent whatever life God loaned to them to avoid Him like the plague,who run screaming or pick ugly fights, or worse, whose eyes glazeover whenever anybody mentions, or even seems about to mention,Jesus. And I am supposed to stand over their dead bodies and slight-ly sway and say, I am the resurrection and the life, he that believeth in me though he were dead, yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believethon me shall never, never die, and then soothe the grieved with sentiments that denigrate and con- tradict and crash headlong into the Gospel. They pay me $50 or$200—the price of a nice pair of shoes or a piece of fish cooked justright and washed down with some adolescent wine—to read to themand to intimate the dead guy was a peach.

I warn him of this ritzy neighborhood as though any exposure to thewealth might contaminate his soul—which it could. I see him saferin the squalor he inhabits, sleeping in his family car parked in aban-doned lots in neighborhoods that seemingly God Himself aban-doned long before José was born. “Stay in the car,” I say for the ninth time. I give him my stash of carbs I carry in the car to combat low blood sugar. If all goes like thisday has gone so far, I will faint just as they lower the polished ma-hogany into the ground.

The next part is the hardest. I need to go one-on-one with the be- reaved. They always want something from me, something they refuseto own or name. They want me to forgive them for their lives, to granta grand do-over, not just for themselves and the deceased, but some-times for several generations of their kind. They want me to design aGod for them who’s useful in the moment, who is inclined to mira-cles on demand, who will perform when summoned, then stand, qui-et, in the corner, until required again. Y ou’d think this would be eas-ier after forty years. Y ou really would. I must say I am more awkward, and nervier, at cocktail parties. At least here there’s no expectat ion in small talk. We have all been handed little scraps of paper that tell us the parts we’re cast to play—the roles, newly-assigned for the bereaved, unpracticed, unaccept-able, unsupportable almost without exception. My role is long stud-ied, too often rote, stiff, and amateurish at the same time. I walk into the chapel space. There’s money in the room. A lot of it. Not well-concealed. I bristle. Even Jesus didn’t hold out much hopefor the rich, young ruler. But, at least, he looked on him with sorrowas he walked away. At least, Heloved him. Unlike me. I can’t stand people who have money. In my heart it isn’t the love of money that’sthe root of evil, but selfishness. I feel righteous, violent fury againstanyone who has a lot of it and doesn’t give it to the poor. “Y ou’ll want to meet the mother,” the undertaker grabs my arm and gestures toward a private space, a little alcove where a womanstands supported by a gray-haired man. She doesn’t look a day overthirty. I’m thinking that with enough money you can redress thedamage wreaked by entire decades of decay. My guess is she has paid,and paid well, for the erasure of a good twenty years, and even then,this man, who must be her husband, has a running start of, I bet, aquarter of a century. I want to go back to the embalming-canasta room and tell the ladies, Au contraire, there is youth on offer if you’re sufficiently bankrolled to pay for it. “He was just nine years old,” the undertaker is whispering to me.“Who?” I say.“The boy.

The undertaker is concerned. “What’s wrong with you? Are you ill? Y ou need to meet the mother.” “Call someone else,” I say. This guy knows very well I do not, can- not, have not ever buried children. He knows not to ever call me whenit is a child who’s died. “There is no one else,”he says.“That’s why I called you.

She concentrates her face into a tight frown. “We can’t do a fu-neral for my baby.” “No,” I respond.“Y ou tell them,” she stands like a statue, like a guard.I walk over to the undertaker and tell him to send the people all away. “We can’t do much,” I say, “but we cannot do this.” No one objects, not one person in the place.

He says, “I come to see if you need help.”“Y es, we do,” I and the mother chorus chant together as though we’ve practiced it. “Okay, well then,” José says. “I will tell you of when I died and what it is like there, and when you know that about it, I will tell youwhat the people there tell me to say. And you will ask the question.” The mother takes in a long, smooth draught of air, then lets it out, eyes closed. She opens up her eyes and touches José’s sleeve.

The rail cars, all shiny with new black paint under the red glow of the station, wait for the departure signal. Theengineers appear from the rail office with their routes and switchingmaps in hand and hot thermoses. Their faces, sad and determined,look as though they have worked all of their lives at the same jobs. Charley is 107’s engineer tonight. Standing nearly a head taller than most men on his train, he carries the demeanor of a command-er. His long, black engineer coat has an insignia sewn into the sleeves,as if branded there. Charley is the longest serving engineer and re-spected by his crew, but he is a taskmaster. Everything must be onschedule or someone will have to answer to him. No one is departing from Hobbs End Station this night. There never is. The signal is given, and the conductors with their black wooluniforms and leather caps step aboard.

He paces the aisle with an overwhelming feeling of desponden- cy. He needs a mission, the thorn perpetually in his side. No matterhow many runs he makes, there will always be another, and another,and another. The mission is never accomplished. Paul has the next car forward of Ivan’s.

And we only have twelve stops. The poor engine is gonna blow a gasket with the load.Charley needs a second engine, or we may get stuck somewhere.”Paulrelishes in his work. He once got 136 passengers into his car. Six ofthem were children though. “We will have over a thousand passengers tonight,” Ivan says without thinking. “Be careful man, you don’t want Charley catching you counting. That isn’t our business,” Paul whispers, “we just get them on board.” “Y eah, we just get them on board.” Ivan turns away with a frown and closes the door between the cars. The train travels in darkness toward its first stop. Even when empty, it always seems to move slowly. Just before 8:00 PM, it pulls into its first stop. Passengers stream aboard, having poured them-selves out of bars along the street running parallel to the tracks. Soonthe whole car is filled with the stench of cigarette smoke and alcohol.Many have brought bottles on board with them, continuing to drinkas the train passes out into the night. Ivan only takes bottles awaywhen he sees them, but he doesn’t really care to look for them any-more, just so long as they don’t get off the train with them. He wouldbe held liable for that. The next stop is near one of the port towns, usually rife with drugs, with tonight no exception. People board so stoned they don’tknow or care where they are going. Ivan notes with increasing sad-ness the number of children boarding. What are they doing out at this hour? thinks Ivan. Then one of them spits in his face when he asks her how old she is. Her glazed eyes speak volumes as he turns away to getpeople seated. Y ou can’t talk with them when they are like that. It gnaws at Ivan to think of the children whose lives have sunk to this level, often because the parents have either given up on them orare in worse shape themselves. It doesn’t seem fair, but what did jus-tice have to do with it. These children, unwilling or unable to fightfor themselves, have given up on everyone. No wonder they are rid-ing this train tonight. If society has given up on them, why should hecare? The girl with the glazed eyes, who couldn’t have been more thanfifteen, dressed in tattered jeans and a shirt more revealing than sug-gestive, stares at the seat in front of her. The train seems to be moving a little more quickly now, but the time to the next stop remains unchanged.

The gentleman, satisfied with his answer, goes off to sleep. They just don’t understand, thought Ivan, it’s the journey and not the destination that matters. Ivan turns on his heel and goes back through the car to make sure everything is in order. Nearly a third of the seats are full.Some of the young stockbrokers, laptop computers in their briefcas-es and Wall Street Journals in hand, are annoyed about having to ride the train. They are unable to get comfortable in their seats. Somework on whatever projects they have in their computers.

They never can get enough, and justlike the junkie girl at the other end of the car, they need more. Through the night the train rumbles on, filling with passengers and freight in a never-ending procession through the stops in the red-light district, past the hospital, and through the dark streets of thepoor. Poverty leads so many people to bad decisions, thinks Ivan. A young man boards the train at the last stop, bleeding from a woundhe had received in a fight. The man sitting next to him offers first aid,but he refuses any help. The ride will soon be over anyway, thinks Ivan. There is always the darkness before the dawn, but it is darkest here at Hope Bridge. This is the last stop. Pulling up, the train settlesunder its weight. Ivan surveys his car. He isn’t supposed to count thenumber of souls aboard, but it is a habit from having been a soldier.Commanders always wanted a body count. He has a hundred andeighteen aboard. The train sits motionless for quite some time, onlythe smoke from the stack and the sound of the motor signaling itspresence. He knows Charley won’t go back until they are full. Ivan stands in the door of his car, stepping down for loading, waiting. From the shore near the bridge Ivan sees movement. Slowlysome very wet people come aboard.

I was lucky. When the hospital plugged my genetic information into the National Marrow Donor Base, we got an initial 639 “hits” forpotential donors. Some cancer patients wind up with only a few po-tential donors, some with none. Noreen, the ultra-brilliant hospitalgeneticist, assured me that she was confident that we’d find a matchamong the 639 for a “generic white guy.” As the potentially-cancer-fighting cells flowed into my chest, I closed my eyes to visualize healing angels entering my body like kidswhizzing down a playground slide. The angels were all shapes, sizes,and races. Each carried a satchel with their belongings and a canistervacuum cleaner—which they would use to vacuum up my cancercells. My wife Louise aided my visualization by whispering Psalm 91in my ear: For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.

Noreen phoned me after conducting a preliminary screening of my genetic makeup.“Lots of British Isles and Germanic heritage,”shesaid, telling me what I already knew. “And just a dollop of French.” Iwas amazed. That dollop was a great-grandmother.“And then there’san odd gene,” she continued, referring to the gene in a code thatsounded like a license plate.“It’s Mediterranean-Iberian Peninsula ormaybe Italian.” “What?”I said incredulously, knowing that such ancestry was be- yond family records.

Noreen hit on all cylinders with both donors, matching twelveout of twelve markers. Non-related donors must remain anonymous for a year after a transplant. All I know is that my donor is a twenty-year-old male, re-cruited from the U.S. Department of Defense, meaning that he’s inuniform, but I don’t know which branch of the service. I suspect he’sstationed back East because a courier hand carried the newly-har-vested cells onto a plane that didn’t arrive in Portland until aboutnine o’clock the same evening. The courier grabbed the first taxi toget the cells to the hospital. Angels were sliding into me before mid-night. During the initial weeks, doctors concentrate more on monitor- ing the potentially fatal treatment than the underlying cancer. Bloodcounts guide them in adjusting medicine to help make the donor cellscomfortable in their new home while easing my old cells into retire-ment. This is serious stuff.

In doing so recently I was deeply struck by not only the clarity of his thought, but also the numerous places where he anticipated conceptswell known to readers of C.G. Jung, including his charting of the hu-man unconscious through its personal and collective levels down toa core of unlimited depth. I was further struck by James’s presciencein other areas of current thinking and ended by writing a book doc-umenting his wide-ranging foresight in medicine, philosophy, andtheology as well as psychology. For this article I focus on the themeof the infinite inner world and James’s influence on Jung in this re-gard. James’s view that the fruits of religious experience for living are what give such experience its value, rather than some philosophical or theological criterion, is a major point in his philosophy. The secondchapter of Varieties contains James’s famous definition of religion: the feelings, acts, and experiences of individuals in their soli- tude, so far as they apprehend themselves to stand in relation towhatever they may consider the divine. (p.31) Religion is thus drawn completely into the experiential sphere. A bit later, James adds this, which ties him in immediately with the theme of other worlds: 25"

T o get at them you must go behind the foreground of existenceand reach down to that curious sense of the whole residual cos-mos as an everlasting presence, intimate or alien, terrible oramusing, lovable or odious, which in some degree everyonepossesses. This sense of the world’s presence ,...i s our answer to the question, “What is the character of this universe in whichwe dwell?” (p.35) James notes that “we are in the end absolutely dependent on the universe” (p. 51). These statements are profound, although we sel- dom think about their vast implications. The Interdependence of Science and Religion to the degree that we are mistaken as to the nature of this phys- ical cosmos, our experience in the dimension of the spirit is a contin-uous self-deception. At the same time, there being no final answer asto that nature, we can only go as deep as we can go, which is goodenough, provided we realize that our quest is open-ended, and wework steadily at coming to greater depth and objectivity of under-standing. T o know that we have indeed gone as far as we can present-ly go requires, in turn, that we know ourselves to a degree appropri-ate to our knowledge of the universe, so as to avoid deceiving our-selves as much as we can. If undertaken seriously, this dual processmay well be a reasonable description of a “total reaction upon life,”in James’s sense. And knowing ourselves now involves taking into ac-count unconscious motivations and processes. In Varieties James considers the divergent attitudes of “healthy- mindedness,”in which the reality of evil is essentially denied, and “thesick soul,” in which suffering engenders growth: There is no doubt that healthy-mindedness is inadequate as a philosophical doctrine, because the evil facts which it refuses positively to account for are a genuine portion of reality; and theymay after all be the best key to life’s significance, and possibly theonly openers of our eyes to the deepest levels of truth. (p.163, emphasis added) Conversion: Forming a New Center the formation of a deeper personal center establishes a new unity of the personality. Let us note that for Jung, like James, the uni-fications include not only the reconciliation of previously discordantparts of the individual psyche, but also the alignment of that unifiedperson with the universe of matter and spirit.26 John L.

      "text": "James notes that each of us has a variety of interests or personal centers. He gives as an example alternative pictures of the President of the United States either in Washington or camping in the moun-tains as two essentially different persons. What brings such changes about is the way in which emotional excitement alters. Things hot and vital to us today are cold to-morrow. [The hot parts] are in short the centers of our dynam-ic energy, whereas the cold parts leave us indifferent and passivein proportion to their coldness . . . Let us hereafter, in speaking of the hot place in a man’s consciousness, the group of ideas to which he devotes himself,and from which he works, call it the habitual center of his per- sonal energy. (pp.195-196) In this framework, then, conversion is the formation of a new, more stable and permanent center of personal energy, as James says: A mind is a system of ideas, each with the excitement it arouses...T h e c o l l e c t i o n o fi d eas alters by subtraction or addition in the course of experience . . . A mental system may be under-mined or weakened by this alteration . . . and yet for a time keptupright by dead habit. But a new perception, a sudden emo-tional shock, or an occasion which lays bare the organic alter-ation, will make the whole fabric fall together; and then thecentre of gravity sinks into an attitude more stable, for the newideas that reach the centre in the rearrangement seem now tobe locked there, and the new structure remains permanent.(p.197) Jung would describe the same process as the appearance of a symbol that embodies a steeper gradient in the psyche toward which things now move. James quotes James H. Leuba, whose thought isvirtually identical to James’s own summary of his lectures: Professor Leuba, in a valuable article on the psychology of con- version, subordinates the theological aspect of the religious lifealmost entirely to its moral aspect. The religious sense he de-fines as “the feeling of unwholeness, or moral imperfection, of sin, to use the technical word, accompanied by the yearning af-ter the peace of unity. The word “religion,” he says, “is gettingmore and more to signify the conglomerate of desires andemotions springing from the sense of sin and its release.”(p. 201) James’s own summary formula (pp. 507–508) is: The warring gods and formulas of the various religions do indeed cancel each other, but there is a certain uniform deliverance in which religions all appear to meet. It consists oftwo parts:27 William James and the Infinite Inner World"

The solution is a sense that we are saved from the wrongness by making proper connection with the higher powers. When James comes to the topic of mysticism and mystical expe- rience, he sounds an experiential note echoed later by J. Middleton Murry, in God, in which he compares and contrasts the experience of anesthesia with the true mystical opening that is the product of anintensive personal search. But here we begin to get the approach tothe concept of the unconscious as such, and the fact that mystical ex-perience universally involves a deep sense that questions are an-swered and opposites are reconciled. James says that it was his expe-rience with nitrous oxide that showed him that our normal “ration-al” consciousness is only a part of our being, only one form of con-sciousness, and that for him it points to a metaphysical reality. The keynote of [the experience] is invariably a reconciliation. It is as if the opposites of the world, whose contradictoriness andconflict make all our difficulties and troubles, were melted intounity. Not only do they, as contrasted species, belong to oneand the same genus, but one of the species, the nobler and better one, is itself the genus, and so soaks up and absorbs its opposite into itself. (pp. 387–389) The assertion that our “rational” ego-consciousness is only one of many possible forms of consciousness is very innovative. The framework of concepts in which we think could be replaced by oth-ers, even in the physical sciences. This also suggests that the conceptsthemselves, while they cover the seemingly available logical ground,don’t encompass the worldfield, which is nonrational in itself. Beyond the experiences of being in the presence of an overarch- ing meaning, James puts “cosmic consciousness” itself, a term thatJames credits to R. M. Bucke. According to Bucke, cosmic conscious-ness is an awareness of the life and order of the universe. There is alsoa sense of intellectual enlightenment which alone would make the in-dividual almost a member of a new species. Then there is a state ofmoral exaltation and joyousness, which is even more important thanthe enhanced intellectual power. Finally, there is a consciousness ofeternal life, “not a conviction that he shall have this, but the con-sciousness that he has it already.” (p. 398) This sense of the aliveness of the universe resonates with the dis- tinction, in ancient Greek, between Zoë(indestructible aliveness) and bios, the characteristic traits of a specified life, the outlines that dis-28 John L.

As Karl Kerenyi says in Dionysios: Zoë is the thread upon which every individual bios is strung like a bead, and which, in contrast to bios, can be conceived ofonly as endless ...( p .xxxvi) This is the best characterization of the aliveness in the depths of the psyche that I have encountered. The Conversion Process as Motivated from Within as to process, James employs the analogy of our trying to remem- ber a word or a name, the access to which remains “jammed” as long as we concentrate upon recalling it. And so it is with conversion: A man’s conscious wit and will, so far as they strain towards the ideal, are aiming at something only dimly and inaccuratelyimagined. Y et all the while the forces of mere organic ripeningwithin him are going on towards their own prefigured result,and his conscious strainings are letting loose subconscious al-lies behind the scenes, which in their way work towards re-arrangement. Starbuck seems to put his finger on the root of the matter when he says that to exercise the personal will is still to live inthe region where the imperfect self is the thing most empha-sized. Where, on the contrary, the subconscious forces take the lead, it is more probably the better self in posse which directs theoperation. Instead of being clumsily and vaguely aimed at fromwithout, it is then itself the organizing center. (pp. 209–210, emphasis added) Toward Jung’s Formulation of the Self this last quotation is an almost perfect formulation of Jung’s idea of the Self, which definitely is “the better self in posse,” in one of its major aspects. Jung’s colleague, Erich Neumann, gave a most in-structive image of the Self as Jung sees it, noting that although a liv-ing body contains many systems and processes, it still functions as acoordinated unity: These processes together constitute a unity, the virtual center of which is the Self or entelechy, which is a symbol for the phe-nomenon of the totality of the organism. The total structure . . .can also be conceived of as a center, which directs and controlst h e m ...T his control of all partial processes from an invisible center is the most obvious phenomenon which differentiatesthe living from the inorganic.

It is still leading humanitytoward a deepening of consciousness. James’s approach may wellhave influenced Jung, since the very term “Self”is present in Varieties, taken by James from Frederick Myers. James goes on: When the new center of personal energy has been subcon- sciously incubated so long as to be just ready to open intoflower, “hands off” is the only word for us; it must burst forthunaided! . . . Y ou see why self-surrender has been and alwaysmust be regarded as the vital turning point of the religious life,so far as religious life is spiritual and no affair of outer worksand ritual and sacraments. (p. 210) Jung’s psychology has carried this thread forward, for it is there that the mutual interpenetration of the unseen field and the psyche has continued to be recognized. Consciousness as Field james asks some remarkably challenging questions for the time of his lectures, especially with the controversy over Darwinismraging through those years. Here we encounter a freedom of specu-lation for which it would be hard to imagine a rival in its time. Is an instantaneous conversion a miracle in which God is pres- ent as he is present in no change of heart less strikingly abrupt?...O r ,o n the contrary, may the whole phenomenon of regen- eration, even in these startling instantaneous examples, possi-bly be a strictly natural process, divine in its fruits, of course,b u t ...n e ither more nor less divine in its mere causation and mechanism than any other process, high or low, of man’s inte-rior life? (p. 230) In order to answer these questions, James brings in the then rel- atively new concept of the “field of consciousness,” which reaches be- yond immediate awareness to content “in the margin.” As he says: The important fact which this “field” formula commemorates is the indetermination of the margin. Inattentively realized as isthe matter which the margin contains, it is nevertheless there,and helps both to guide our behavior and to determine the nextmovement of our attention. It lies around us like a “magneticfield,” inside of which our center of energy turns like a compass-needle, as the present phase of consciousness alters into its suc-cessor.

(p. 232) The metaphor of the field is what brings the notion of a “mar- gin” or “fringe” of consciousness into focus. This is a major step, which leads beyond the boundary of subliminal contents, towardthose more distant contents that are truly unconscious. The Unconscious this brings us to one of the most important passages in all of Varieties, the hypothesis of the unconscious itself. James also brings in an energy concept as to the mechanism involved. For him, as forJung, it is the energy of an unconscious content that brings it to con-sciousness when the content is touched by a symbol. I cannot but think that the most important step forward that has occurred in psychology since I have been a student of thatscience is the discovery, first made in 1886, that, in certain sub-jects at least, there is not only the consciousness of the ordinaryfield, with its usual center and margin, but an addition theretoin the shape of a set of memories, thoughts, and feelings whichare extra-marginal and outside of the primary consciousnessaltogether, but yet must be classed as conscious facts of somesort, able to reveal their presence by unmistakable signs. I callthis the most important step forward because, unlike the otheradvances which psychology has made, this discovery has re-vealed to us an entirely unsuspected peculiarity in the constitu-tion of human nature. No other step forward which psychologyhas made can proffer any such claim as this. In particular this discovery of a consciousness existing be- yond the field, or subliminally as Mr. Myers terms it, casts lighton many phenomena of religious biography . . . The most important consequence of having a strongly de- veloped ultra-marginal life of this sort is that one’s ordinaryfields of consciousness are liable to incursions from it of whichthe subject does not guess the source, and which, therefore,take for him the form of unaccountable impulses to act, or in-hibitions of action, of obsessive ideas, or even of hallucinationsof sight or hearing ...d u e t o “ u p r ushes” into the ordinary con- sciousness of energies originating in the subliminal parts of themind. (pp. 233–234) Although James uses the expression “subliminal consciousness,” it is clear that it is in fact unconscious. Jung also takes the passage in this manner. We don’t know when he read the book, but we do knowthat he was aware of the work of Myers, for there are six references to32 John L. Hitchcock"

James speculates that those who experience instantaneous con- versions are those who possess “a large region in which mental work can go on subliminally, and from which invasive experiences, abrupt-ly upsetting the equilibrium of the primary consciousness, maycome.” Our spiritual judgment . . . our opinion of the significance and value of a human event or condition, must be decided on em-pirical grounds exclusively. If the fruits for life of the state of conversion are good, we ought to idealize and venerate it, eventhough it be a piece of natural psychology; if not, we ought tomake short work with it, no matter what supernatural beingmay have infused it. (p. 237) And a bit later: The real witness of the spirit to the second birth is to be foundonly in the disposition of the genuine child of God, the perma-nently patient heart, the love of self eradicated. And this, it hasto be admitted, is also found in those who pass no crisis, andmay even be found outside Christianity altogether . . . And when we touch our own upper limit and live in our own highestcenter of energy, we may call ourselves saved, no matter howmuch higher someone else’s center may be. (pp. 238–239, emphasis added) This statement offers a creative way to look at the whole of the evolution of consciousness. If a given transformation, such as the for- mation of a new spiritual center of personal energy, fails to occur insome cases, we must remember that we are at a threshold in the evo-lution of consciousness. God does not condemn those in whom thetransition fails; the whole previous history of evolution consists precise- ly of such failures. And finally on the relationship of psychology and religion: The lower manifestations of the Subliminal, indeed, fall within the resources of the personal subject: his ordinary sense-material, inattentively taken in and subconsciously remem-bered and combined, will account for all his usual automa-tisms. But just as our primary wide-awake consciousnessthrows open our senses to the touch of things material, so it islogically conceivable that if there be higher spiritual agencies that can directly touch us, the psychological condition of theirdoing so might be our possession of a subconscious region which alone should yield access to them. The hubbub of thewaking life might close a door which in the dreamy Subliminalmight remain ajar or open ...T h e n o t i o n o fa s u b c o nscious self certainly ought not at this point of our inquiry to be held33 William James and the Infinite Inner World"

(pp. 242–243, emphasis added) James seems clearly to envision a transpersonal region common to us all, and he equally clearly envisions the “Deity” or “higher spiri- tual agencies” as operating from within the persons affected. If we see James as postulating a deeper—ultimately infinitely deep—region beyond the more personal areas of the subconscious inthe above, it seems possible that Jung, who said the same in variousplaces, was stimulated in some measure by his reading of Varieties. The Self recall james ’s summary formula given above: The warring gods and formulas of the various religions do in- deed cancel each other, but there is a certain uniform deliver-ance in which religions all appear to meet. It consists of twoparts:1. An uneasiness; and2. Its solution. Now we can follow James’s continuation: The individual, so far as he suffers from his wrongness and crit-icizes it, is to that extent consciously beyond it, and in at leastpossible touch with something higher, if anything higher exists.Along with the wrong part there is thus a better part of him,even though it may be but a most helpless germ . . . When stage2 (the stage of solution or salvation) arrives, the man identifieshis real being with the germinal higher part of himself; anddoes so in the following way. He becomes conscious that this higher part is coterminous and continuous with a moré of thesame quality, which is operative in the universe outside of him,and which he can keep in working touch with, and in a fashionget on board of and save himself when all his lower being has goneto pieces in the wreck. (pp. 508–509) The “moré of the same quality,” refers to the “germinal higher self.”James pursues the question: Is it real? The various theologies an- swer in the affirmative: They all agree that the “moré” really exists; though some of them hold it to exist in the shape of a personal god or gods,while others are satisfied to conceive it as a stream of ideal ten-dency embedded in the eternal structure of the world. They allagree, moreover, that it acts as well as exists, and that some-thing really is effected for the better when you throw your lifeinto its hands. (p. 510)34 John L. Hitchcock"

      "text": "The subconscious self is, I believe, exactly the mediating term re- quired. Apart from all religious considerations, there is actually and literally more life in our total soul than we are at any timeaware of . . . What Mr. Myers said in 1892 is as true as when itwas first written: “Each of us is in reality an abiding psychicalentity far more extensive than he knows ...T h e S e l f manifests through the organism; but there is always some part of the Selfunmanifested; and always, as it seems, some power of organicexpression in abeyance or reserve.” ...L e t m e t h e n p r o p ose, as an hypothesis, that whatever it may be on its farther side, the “moré” with which in religious experience we feel ourselvesconnected is on its hither side the subconscious continuation of our conscious life. (pp. 511–512) At the very end of his lectures, James adds his own interpretive “overbeliefs” in the religious realm. The further limits of our being plunge, it seems to me, into an altogether other dimension of existence from the sensible andmerely “understandable” world. Name it the mystical region, orthe supernatural region, whichever you choose . . . Y et the un-seen region in question is not merely ideal, for it produces ef-fects in this world. When we commune with it, work is actuallydone upon our finite personality, for we are turned into newm e n ...B u t that which produces effects within another reality must be termed a reality itself, so I feel as if we had no philo-sophic excuse for calling the unseen or mystical world unreal. God is the natural appellation, for us Christians at least, for the supreme reality, so I will call this higher part of the universeby the name of God. We and God have business with each oth-er; and in opening ourselves to his influence our deepest des-tiny is fulfilled. (pp. 515–517) And James closes with his personal statement of commitment to the attempt not merely to believe, but to act on behalf of his beliefs. This essay summarizes one of the central theses of John Hitchcock’s book- length manuscript now in process. Dr. Hitchcock holds graduate degrees inclinical mental health counseling, phenomenology of science and religion,and astronomy. He has taught mythology and astronomy at San FranciscoState University, and physics at the University of Wisconsin at La Crosse. Heoffers workshops specializing in science as a source of numinous symbolsfor personal growth and daily living: science as myth. He is the author offour books in the field of science and spirituality, two of which are publishedby the Swedenborg Foundation. Besides the book excerpted in this essay,which links William James’s prescient work with that of Jung and others, hehas recently finished another on the problem of evil. John works inColorado as a Jungian psychotherapist. He also serves on the board of theBoulder, Colorado, Friends of Jung.35 William James and the Infinite Inner World"

My youngest child,a girl not six months old, had passed to the other side inNovember 1876. In that spring of 1882 diphtheria attacked us, and on the 16th of May, our oldest boy, Horace, not quite eighteen years of age,was taken from earth. When he realized that he must go, he spokecalmly and pleasantly of it, and said, “It is all right.” In one weekfrom that time on the 23rd of the month, my husband followedour boy. On the 29th my second son, Howard, thirteen years old,was with his father and brother. Almost his last words were theLord’s Prayer, as he was accustomed to repeat it before sleepingeach night. Then he was gone as quietly as if it was only for anight’s rest. My next child, Harry, eleven years of age, stayed with us until July 8th. The last four days he was with us, he was consciously inboth worlds at times. He said he saw his father and brothers asplainly as he saw me, and said his father asked where I was and 38"

At one time he told me, “Howard brings me water to drink, and it does not hurt me like the water you give me; heknows when I want it without my telling him.” At another time he spoke of the house his father and brothers were in, as a large house, as he expressed it, “five times bigger thanthis one, and I went up a good many stairs to get to the room theywere in.” As he was very fond of flowers, I asked if he saw any. He an- swered, “Not in the room they were in, but in the rooms I wentthrough to get there I saw some.” “What kind were they,” I asked.He replied, “They were kinds I had never seen before.”Once he said, “There is a black-haired man with father.”I asked, “Who is it?”His answer was, “I do not know.”By the description he gave, I thought it might be an uncle of his father’s, one he [his father] was much attached to, who hadgone from earth some years before Harry was born. I had a smallpicture of this uncle and brought it to Harry. Before I could say a word, he said, “Don’t tell me who it is.” He took it, looked at it for a moment, then exclaimed, “UncleHoward . . . that is the man with father.” He sometimes spoke of other people talking with his father. It seemed to me that my husband was meeting and being welcomedby friends who had gone before. It was a pleasant thought and al-most forbade us to mourn for those who still live and in the Lord’sgood time shall meet again. One day Harry said, “I told him I would come, and I am going.” As he spoke he raised himself in bed as if to go. I said, “You will stay with me a little longer, won’t you?”He quietly lay down again, but not long after, he went, never to return. He had spoken of his little sister (or the little girl, as he called her) sitting in her father’s lap as his father sang to her or told herstories. To me, it appeared that my dear husband was with hischildren and the friends who were with him, and although wewere left without his visible presence, yet we should rejoice thatthey were “all right” as my oldest son had said when he knew thathe must go. —marion stearns buck My great-grandmother and her surviving children were Swedenborgians.

Olive Buck, one of the thirteen, married John J. Martin, my fa- ther. We were raised in the Swedenborgian church, and upon thedeath by drowning of my six-year-old brother Richie in 1941, I feltcalled to the ministry. In 1952 I graduated from both the HarvardDivinity School and the Swedenborgian seminary and was ordainedin 1953. Throughout my adult life, I have been intrigued by the transcen- dent. I have had psychic experiences ever since the death of my smallbrother and consider my primary mission is to integrate the spiritu-al and natural dimensions of life, relating the mystical to the natural.In one instance in 1990, I preached on the closeness of these tworealms and told the story of my great-grandmother’s loss of her hus-band and three older sons in 1882. As I spoke, I pointed to a large,framed portrait of my great uncle on the altar—Harry Chester Buck.Shortly afterwards, in a session with a professional psychic, Harrymade his presence known and thanked me for remembering andspeaking of him. I was brought up to avoid “dabbling” in the occult, but in the 1960s, through a strange set of circumstances, I became a close friendof the internationally-known psychic, Arthur Ford. In a series of “sit-tings,” I became aware of the presence of my deceased brother as myguardian angel. Of course there is no way of proving this, but I be-lieve it to be consistent with my Swedenborgian faith, and I feel it tobe true. Swedenborg said that he had seen, he had heard, and he hadfelt the world of spirit. My own experiences convince me of not onlythe reality of the spiritual world, but also the closeness of this realmto our work-a-day world. I don’t look to heaven as pie in the sky, butas inspiration for living a heavenly life here and now.

The man standing be-side her hadn’t asked if she was all right, hadn’t offered to call for help,and hadn’t explained where he’d come from. “I’m Ann,” she said, trying to inject a trace of normality.He nodded his head once in her direction. “Steve.”Ann opened her mouth to say just like the actor but closed it be- fore any words escaped. It seemed very strange that no emergency ve-hicles were at the scene yet. Her town prided itself on its quick re-sponse team. “I don’t hear any sirens.” “Me neither,” Steve said.“Shouldn’t we call someone?”“They know. They’ll be here soon enough.”Ann fell silent, lulled by the quiet on the hillside. The only sound was the wind, blowing through the grass at their feet. Looking at thecar below,Ann realized what was odd about the scene. Maxwell Road,where her car sat in a crumpled heap, was a busy road with constanttraffic. Since finding herself on this hillside, Ann hadn’t seen a singlecar go by. “Where are all the cars?” “They’re being held back until everything is cleared up here.”That made sense. Roadblocks must be out to keep the street clear for emergency vehicles. They probably detoured everyone over toHopewell Road.Ann could imagine the traffic snarl that would cause.She glanced over at her companion. Was he one of the emergencycrew? He wasn’t wearing any sort of uniform. Maybe he was a volun-teer fireman in a first responder position. “Are you with the fire department?”His mouth quirked into a half smile. “No.”Ann waited for him to continue and tell her what he actually did do. When it became obvious he wasn’t going to say any more, shestarted to wonder about him. Was he one of those weird accidentchasers who took ghoulish pleasure in car wrecks? She snuck a quick glance at him. He seemed calm and unruffled. Where had he comefrom and how had he gotten here? “Do you live nearby?”“No, not really.”“I don’t see your car anywhere.”“I didn’t come by car,” he said, turning to look fully into her face.

Ann glanced at his face. His voice had suddenly gone deeper, and his expression had tensed. “What do you mean?”“Look again at your car.”By now, they had drawn level with what used to be her dark blue Volvo. Viewed at close range, the damage was devastating. The entireside of the car had collapsed inward, pushing the driver’s door almostinto the back seat. Shards of glass shimmered in the sunlight, sur-rounding the car in a halo of destruction. Ann opened her mouth, but no sound came out. Steve was peer- ing into her face.

There’s my hus- band and kids; I can’t leave them alone!” Silently, Steve looked from her to the car and back again.“Oh God, oh God, oh God.” Ann pressed her fist to her mouth to stop the words. The wind picked up again, making a faint whistlingas it swept over the odd new angles punched into the side of the car.It made a lonely sound that pulled away all sense of warmth, and sheshuddered, over and over. The Volvo seemed distorted in the sunlight, stretched out and folded in on itself at the same time.

There isn’t really much I can give. It’s different for every- one.” They crested the hill and stood together, looking down at the shore of a lake. There were trees to the right and left of it, but the shoreimmediately in front of them had a narrow, sandy beach. Ann couldtaste the tang of water on the wind, which came toward them as agentle breeze. She looked over at Steve. He was mounting a small motorcycle with knobby tires. “What are you doing?”“I have to go now.”“Go? What do you mean?” Ann struggled to keep her voice steady. “I’m going for a ride. It looks like there are some really nice trails over there, and this is a perfect day.” A perfect day? Considering what just happened to her? Ann opened her mouth to argue further, but any chance to do so was lostin the clamor of the motorcycle’s engine as Steve kicked it into life,revved it twice, and roared off down the hillside. Ann was left again with the silence and the wind. She looked back to where her Volvo had been parked but saw only undulating grass.The road and car had vanished. She shivered, turning her back on thebreeze, and began walking slowly down toward the lake. The beach was small but bright with smooth yellow sand, and the lake water was a clear blue. Sunlight rippled across small waves kickedup by the gusts of wind. It seemed empty until Ann looked to the leftof the beach. A small boat was lying on its side in the shadow of thetrees. She moved cautiously toward the boat and almost bumped intothe man standing in the shade at the edge of the water. His khaki shorts and yellow windbreaker stuck to his body and dripped excess water. He stood, shoulders hunched, in water up to hisankles and shivered at intervals. “Come stand in the sun.” Ann spoke without thinking. “It’s warmer.” The man turned, his wide staring eyes hardly focusing. “Did you see that storm?”50 Cathy Strasser"

He still didn’t know.“Listen, do you know where I could find a phone around here? I need to get in touch with someone to tow my boat back.” He un-zipped his windbreaker and peeled it off, exposing a white T-shirtwith the logo “Sailors Do It On The Water” on the front. “That’s bet-ter.

Mike surveyed the dam-age, looking sick. “What a mess.” Ann spoke softly, but Mike still shied away from her. “My car looked like that.” No response. “I don’t remember any-thing. Suddenly I was just standing on a hillside looking at the wreckof my car.” A shudder ran through Mike, and he finally turned to face her. “What the hell is going on?” “I wish I knew.” She filled him in on the events leading up to that moment. “I don’t even know how much time has passed. It seemedlike early afternoon then. It seems the same now.” His shoulders slumped, and he stumbled out of the water and back on to the beach next to her. “What now?” “I don’t know.”“Well, I’m not just going to stand around on this empty beach. I’m going to follow that path over there and see if I can find civiliza-tion.” He gestured toward the woods on the opposite side of thebeach. A narrow path led off through the trees, and Mike marchedacross the sand in that direction. Ann fell in behind him. They walked in silence; the only sounds were the rustling of the leaves in the gentle breeze. She noticed Mike’sclothes had dried completely. Soon he grunted and started to move faster.“That’s more like it.”Lifting her head, Ann saw a lighter area ahead where the trees thinned out. Hurrying, she caught up to Mike as he emerged onto apaved street lined with a mix of houses and stores.52 Cathy Strasser"

Ann looked from side to side as she walked, struck by the seemingly normal street with absolutely no one on it. Mike stopped at an intersection and asked, “Which way?”Ann hardly heard him, her attention held by the corner store. The window was full of yarn, and what a selection! The colors glowed inthe bright sunlight, and the textures cried out to be touched. Therewere several sweaters displayed in the background, and Ann was in-trigued by a stitch combination she’d never seen before. “I’m going to stop in here.”“What do you mean? We need to find out what’s going on.”“I’ve never seen yarn like this before. I want to get a closer look.” She paused in the doorway and glanced back. Mike looked bewil-dered. His now dry hair blew across his forehead in the gusts of windsweeping around the corner. “Good luck.” “Wait,” Mike said, his forehead creased and his shoulders rising and drawing in toward his neck. “Don’t you want to find out what’shappened?” Ann had a sudden vision of him from college. He’d had the same look whenever the professor called on him and he was unprepared.“Right now I want to look around in this store.” She passed throughthe doorway.

All my parents could come up with during WWII was a secondhand, one-door, white Norge refrigerator with a clock that never worked built into its door. It had an ice compartment that held two ice trays and maybe a pint of ice cream. Oh how mymother longed to be part of the national cool-and-frozen movement. She took her first tentative steps toward freon fulfillment by buy- ing plastic molds that she filled with Kool-Aid and placed in the icecompartment. In about five hours she served them as ice pops. Theyweren’t anything close. Sometimes she removed the ice trays alto-gether and replaced them with two packs of Birds Eye frozen vegeta-bles. But this innovation met with disaster for two reasons. First, mygrandmother, who lived with us, thought we should always have freshvegetables whenever possible; second, and perhaps more important,my father did not have any ice for his scotch. I was often sent to ournext-door neighbors’ to borrow a tray of ice. Y es, it was indeed hard for Mother to become part of the frozen- food scene. But life’s problems have a way of working themselves out,and in this case they did with my grandmother and the old Norge dy-ing around the same time. Maybe Grandma went first, I am not sure.Anyway, only the Norge could be replaced. The new arrival was one of those square-cornered, avocado, two- door jobs, followed immediately by more and more frozen foods: firstvegetables, then desserts, and eventually whole TVdinners. Dad didn’t seem to notice this change in the menu, because with an un-limited supply of ice, his cocktail hour could be extended and dinnerbecame somewhat of an afterthought. Mother continued to serve themeals, even the TVdinners that came with their own aluminum tray- like dish, on china plates and to have a centerpiece of fresh flowers onthe dining-room table. Then Dad died, and Mother stopped cookingaltogether. It’s not that she was depressed; she just saw an opportu-nity and took advantage of it. From then on, we each simply thawedour frozen dinners in the oven. In later life, equipped with a microwave oven, Mother joined the take-out movement with the same enthusiasm as she had joined thefrozen-food movement. However, to the end, she was a traditional-ist. Although many of her friends were gone, those remaining whovisited were always served Mother’s take-out cuisine on china plates,and her table always had fresh flowers. wayne carhart recently published a collection of essays on the history of Brattleboro, Vermont, commemorating the one-hundredth anniversary of its Chamber of Commerce.

Despite centuries-old buildings, Germanyseemed to be a progressively modern place. However, when I triedrounding up ingredients for a cookie recipe during a bout of home-sickness, I concluded that it was a Third-World nation: I mean, whatkind of a country doesn’t have chocolate chips and brown sugar? When I moved to Spain four years after my German experience and saw a mother holding her child, pants down, over a sewer drainin the middle of the pedestrian street, I shook my head in disgust andthought, surely, Spain is Third World. My verdict was seemingly con-firmed soon after when I urgently needed a toilet, rushed into arestaurant, asked where their WCwas, and was directed to a small, closet-sized room with a porcelain square on the floor hosting twomolded footprints straddling a hole in the ground. Y et, when I re-member that toilet now, I realize it was pretty upscale: at least therewas running water and toilet paper. 57Opposite: Alexander Calder. The Preying Mantis, 1936.

I was coming to the conclusion that catego-rizing worlds was not solely dependent on toilet facilities. In central China, the first time I went for a walk at night around the university campus where I taught, I had an otherworldly experi-ence. I felt that I had been transported back in time and was stum-bling into a Hooverville, a shantytown from the Depression era.People were sitting around outside shacks; open fires burned wherethey cooked food; men sat on six-inch-high stools with their tanktops rolled up over their bellies. In summer people just brought theirlives outside; indoors was too hot. I knew I had arrived in the Third World. But how does one pin it down? My definition of Third World came to mean places where people lived as if they were at a camp-ground or where they carried around thermoses of boiled water.Many countries do not have safe drinking water; therefore, it must beboiled thoroughly to kill parasites. Additionally, hot water is not ontap day and night as I was used to. After I got over the annoyance ofhaving hot running water for only four hours in the evening, I foundit amusing that in the morning a Foreign Affairs Office staffer wouldtrudge upstairs, bringing me two thermoses of boiled water which Ifondly referred to as my “hot walking water.” I found a formal explanation of the numbered worlds while liv- ing in Vietnam. First-world countries have developed liberal and cap-italist economies; the second world has developed socialisteconomies; and the Third World is underdeveloped. So what doesthat mean in practical terms? Well, based on my experience, I wouldsay a first-world country is one where people have sit down, flush toi-lets equipped with soft toilet paper, and if anyone carries a thermosin public, it’s a designer one containing Starbucks coffee. Second-world countries (are there any left anymore?) are a bit of a gray area,but you might say their WCs provide toilet paper, although it’s scratchy. In the Third World you carry around rusty thermoses ofboiled water, and over 70 percent of the population uses squat toiletswith no toilet-paper dispenser, and sometimes not even partitions forprivacy between stalls. In today’s global environment, it’s very disconcerting to see how wide the gap is between the haves and the have-nots.

The scary thing is that although I’ve seen all the above,I don’t think I’ve even begun to see the Third World yet. It bogglesmy mind to witness the extent of poverty and within the same day,or hour, to see the wealth and advanced technology that our worldhas to offer. Recently the term developed has come to signify a country with a highly organized economy and political system where the great ma-jority live above the poverty line. On the other hand, nations that areworking toward a developed status are euphemistically called “devel-oping” countries. Irish writer Dervla Murphy is more straightfor-ward in her descriptions: she simply sees the “rich world” and the“poor world.” As political developments have rendered the former tripartite classification almost irrelevant, it seems that we are now down to twoworlds, but the global whittling must continue. Former UnitedNations Secretary-General Kofi Annan declared: “We don’t have twoworlds. We have only one world. And we cannot have a situationwhere you have immense wealth and extreme poverty living side-by-side and not try to do anything about it.” When the gap turns into a chasm, people are either going to find a way to bridge it or else fall in.

A three-month garbage strike left mounds of uncol-lected refuse along roadsides. Additionally, a sugar shortage createdan ongoing hardship for a culture that takes tea several times a day!Nairobi had already experienced the impact of terrorism through the1998 bombing of the American embassy. Massive government lay-offs of civil servants along with general lack of economic opportuni-ty resulted in the proliferation of small business enterprises. Vendinggoods in open-air markets, producing homemade ice pops to sell toneighborhood children, or raising and selling chickens were justsome of the ways people found to sustain themselves. I was ushered into this unfamiliar world through the portal of the homestay experience, the foundation of Donald Watt’s originalvision for the Experiment. Watt believed that through interculturalexchange, people “learn to live together by living together,” and thehomestay experience fosters peace through understanding. As itturned out, my homestay “parents” and I were exactly the same age.Elizabeth Achieng had a long career as headmistress of a Montessorischool and also coordinated SIT’s Study Abroad homestay program. Samm Rabette, as managing director of Joint Educational Services ofKenya, worked in the field of educational and intercultural exchange.My first introduction to Samm was a pre-trip phone call in which Iasked if there was anything I could bring him from the U.S. He an-swered enthusiastically, “Y es, how about a suit?

It contains what is considered to be thelargest slum area in East Africa and is bordered by the T oi Market, animmense open-air market.

Although not wealthy in terms of material possessions, this fam- ily was rich in their connections with people. Visitors regularlydropped by to say hello, even if just for a few minutes. No appoint-ments were necessary, with the customary handshaking all around.People stopped in to buy a chicken, borrow sugar, or exchange somenews. Guests were automatically invited for dinner if their visit hap-pened to coincide with the meal being served. One eveningElizabeth’s daughter was scheduled to fly to the U.S. where she was tojoin her husband. Fifteen of her friends arrived at the house to saygoodbye and caravan together to the airport to see her off. Because itwas dinner time, all fifteen were invited to share in the meal.Whatever food was available was simply stretched to accommodatethe number of guests. My typical day in Nairobi started at dawn with the crowing of Samm’s rooster and the melodious call to prayer from the nearbymosque. Tucked safely under my mosquito net in my half-awakestate, I knew I had another hour or so before I would start my day.When I did arise, a tray was waiting for me with bread, jam, and tea.Following a bucket shower, some phone calls, and a review of my listfor the day, I was off to conduct my interviews and explore Nairobi.Mornings were cool and cloudy, but soon the day became clear andsunny. By four o’clock in the afternoon it was boiling! Most days I had some kind of appointment, visit, or task lined up. I interviewed herbalists, administrators in the city’s psychiatrichospital, Western-style counselors, teachers, local people—anyonewho would talk with me about mental health. Getting used to theconcept of time in Kenya was an adjustment. The pace of life felt un-hurried, and things always took longer than I anticipated. If I accom-plished just one thing during each day, this was success. For a personwho is usually punctual, I found it unsettling to be late so frequent-ly, but my African colleagues did not seem fazed in the least. Evenemail access at the internet café was slow—it usually took an hour ormore just to get through new messages in my inbox. In the evenings, the family gathered to eat in the living room— fried chicken or vegetables in a sauce, ugali (a starch made fromground maize), whole potatoes, and sukumawiki (a dark green veg-etable similar to kale).

Without refrigeration, leftover food wasstored in the pantry till the next meal, despite the daytime heat.Overcooking the food next time around seemed to destroy any accu-mulated bacteria —I never got sick. During my first week in Nairobi, I was overwhelmed by the prospect of finding my way around, by the crowds of people, the opensewer system flanking the footpaths and streets, and the piles of burn-ing refuse along the roadsides of Kibera. As the only Westerner mosteverywhere I went, I was the frequent beneficiary of comments suchas “Hey, mzungu” (white person)! This was not done in a maliciousway, but merely a statement of the obvious. At first I got lost everyday trying to take a shortcut home through the T oi market. Not want-ing to appear confused or disoriented, I avoided backtracking at allcosts and learned to find my way home by following the sound of thegenerator near Samm and Elizabeth’s house. Eventually, I grew to feelmore comfortable making my way through the neighborhood andother parts of Nairobi on foot, riding city buses, or hopping oncrowded matatus (privately-owned vans providing public trans-portation). Each matatu had its own personality, sporting suchnames as “The Jazz Quartet,”“Born to Suffer,” and “Soul Strippin.”Asthe saying goes, “A matatu is never full”—always room for one morepassenger, even if it meant hanging off the side of the vehicle. For me, the lessons of Kenya were deep and wide. My research showed that as in all cultures, there is depression, anxiety, alcoholism,and work and family conflicts. These conditions were simply referredto as “stress” or were manifested as physical problems. Malaria ormalaria-like symptoms, such as headaches or muscle and joint pain,were not uncommon. Life included suffering, but there was great joyas well. The Kenyan people seemed to maintain a different attitudetoward problems in general. As U.S. Americans, we embrace a con-stitutional right to happiness—as soon as a problem is identified, itmust be “fixed.” In contrast, the Kenyan attitude suggests that life canstill be good even in the presence of difficulties.

As it gains speed each man holds his lunch pailin his lap and hunkers down, out of the travel-wind. The grating ofsteel wheels on mine rail is the single sound. At every stop along therock-wall passage, a group of men get off and, headlamps bobbing,disappear into the blackness. Mile after clicking mine-rail mile adds to the distance from the station, from the shaft, the surface, from life. Nothing lives downhere; nothing grows. Plant life is seen only in the lunch pail, lettuceperhaps, or fruit. The blue denim jacket my nose almost touches in front belongs to a huge rider named Slav, a miner of perhaps sixty years who speaksin grunts. Slav is probably the best timberman in the mine, out ofhundreds. He works mostly alone and handles timbers 12 inches ona side as if they were sticks. But Slav’s greatest claim to fame may behis unique method of betting at the roulette wheel in the Silver DollarSaloon. He plays only on payday night, after taking care of his bar tab.What’s left he bets as fast, silently and intently as he can, always onthe same number, ten. Needless to say, that number comes up asrarely as any other. Slav, newly broke in minutes every payday, thenhurries from the wheel to the bar, where he perches most evenings af-ter that for two weeks, running up his tab. When others watch hishasty payday betting, he looks askance at them, as if to say, If you were smart, you wouldn’t waste time gambling. About three men in back of me on the train car, Pappy sits with a strange lean to the left. This old welterweight, also sixty or so, hadhis brain scrambled in the ring and does everything to the left, I meanthe physical left. When he walks down a mine drift, with maybe threefeet of clearance on each side, he faces frontward but veers to the left,then corrects and starts over. Pappy’s a good talker and makes bettersense than many of the men working underground. Almost half of the men are old enough to be my father. There are ex-cons on the train with me, along with full-time drunks, run-awayhusbands, thieves, and worse. As the youngest on the payroll, I get nospecial attention. I’m just “Kid.” There is advice. For example, themen laugh when they warn me about going into raw, rowdy Wallace,where “those women ‘er liable to look right motherly atcha.” I laughwith them but don’t say much. The men I know and like the most arenot on this train. They work elsewhere in the mine or on anothershift. One of them is “Blade,” who has a lot of knife-fighting scars anda loud Harley.

We roared seven miles down theroad to wide-open Wallace, shot a few games of pool, swaggeredaround town, and sped back up the mountain, without much talk.We still do this routine. After two months here I don’t think like I did at first. The word finality crops up in my head along with awareness and caution. I’ve talked a few men into putting their wages, like my own, in the WallaceCity Bank. But most will not, saying simply, “This here’s a mine.T omorra’ ain’t always comin’ .” There are no brilliant men, no obviousthinkers, here in this underground crew of hundreds. But I get les-sons, both above and below ground, from watching and listening.Can awareness be a teacher? When I deliberately think about what Isee and hear, not just right away pass onto something else, there ismore understanding about the reasons for those sights and sounds.Perhaps as a reward for clasping this hard life to my bosom is the starkawareness that it cannot last, that each moment is a human treasurenever to be revisited.

This is the ore thatwe drilled and shot yesterday. The caps and dynamite in the drill holeswere set off by the slow-burning fuse while we waited for the traindown below and counted the blasts. Each loaded drill hole means aseparate blast—eight holes, eight blasts. A missing blast means a mis-fire and live explosives, big trouble, in the muck pile the next day. Thedust and powder fumes are long gone this morning. I uncover ourore chute by removing two-inch thick boards and shovel the brokenrock into the square hole in the floor. The ore drops to the haulage,way below for loading in train ore cars. Pete helps shovel with hismuck-stick, and we soon have five or six tons of rich lead ore in thechute, We set the drill up, connect the compressed air hose, then theflexible high-pressure waterline, and begin drilling with a hardenedalloy bit on the end of a two-foot steel drill rod. We change to four-foot and six-foot lengths as each hole deepens. Pete teases me a lot but not about the work. I can do everything he does—drill, load dynamite, cut fuse for sequential firing, crimpcaps, spit (light) the fuses—but just a bit slower. If he doesn’t showup, the work will get done anyway, all of it. He knows this. So he teas-es me about girls. “Forget those eastern girls, kid. Find you a nice Idaho gal.”“Y ou’re right, Pete. Trouble is, I’m not staying in one place long.”“Never find the right girl ’til ya’ settle down. Try it.”“I will someday, Pete.”He shakes his head. “Some guys are scared of females. Y ou?”“Pete, I’m scared to pieces. I want to travel.”This may sound like a casual conversation in a pool room or in the mess hall, but he’s feeding sticks of dynamite into one drill holeafter another while I tamp the sticks back forcefully with a longwooden tamping rod. Meanwhile, there’s air hissing all over the placeout of worn gaskets, water spraying from split hoses and broken seals,and a mist of lubricating oil hanging in the glow of our headlamps.The place smells like a fresh, head-on, two-car collision.

Civilization hungers for the blasted-outproduct, the metal of modern man, the lifeblood of progress. Everyvehicle, engine, house, office, aircraft, and much that we touch eachday issues in part from the rock sent up from below. by far the most important objects sent up from below are the miners at shift’s end. Old-timers like Slav and Pappy take this ascent and surface arrival as just another part of the day. But we youngerminers get visibly excited, talking loudly, laughing, as the man-cage,for us akin to an ascending chrysalis, nears its final destination. Fromthe first day, and without giving it any thought, I fell into this catego-ry in a big way. I feel suddenly reborn, a new person, every time thecage arrives in sunlight to end its upward passage. From whence rises this surge of joy, the pure elation, that wants to scream from my throat, that somersaults the heart, when the minecage reaches the surface? Where in my still-growing body, my youngsoul, my unfilled intellect, lies this ecstatic reservoir? Though no measure can be taken of it, nor can I describe its essence, each of us must own, outside of love, a primitive spring ofsudden, inexplicable ecstasy. I find this highest moment of joy eachday by ascending from the darkness, laughing as I stand on the Devil’shead. Perhaps there is no well, no reservoir of ecstasy. May it be likea harp of tautly-drawn strings hidden in the soul, ready to vibrate,awaiting the caress of the senses? Or is there a neuron circuit in thebrain going endlessly around, seeking the pleasure sign before send-ing forth into the heart and body a burst of rapture? For a moment too splendid to measure, as the journey out of the darkness and everyday self ends, nothing else matters. Neither wis-dom nor muscle, not friends or wealth, play a part.

We slipped and slid, helping each other,clambering down, wetting our feet in the chilly water, grasping dan-gling vines to pull ourselves up the far side. And so our quest began. I had come from T exas, 650 miles away, with the compulsion to climb that hill. My sister, not sharing my passion for the venture, wasdeeply interested in its outcome. She was here mostly for me but soonto be as enmeshed in the challenge of it as she would be in that sea ofbriars. Our cousin had joined the expedition eagerly and proved tobe as tough a specimen of the female gender as I have ever encoun-tered. She was in for the duration and never complained once. Thefourth member of our intrepid coterie was my daughter-in-law,along for the ride, willing to share in the excitement, although fre-quently distracted by every slightest rustling in the underbrush. Acity-bred girl, she envisioned a boa constrictor under every rock, anda cougar stalking our back-trail. My sister led the way, attacking the briars, using the hoe to push back the vegetation, chopping, shoving, and protecting her skin asbest she could from the flesh-eating thorns. We followed in her wake,a step at a time, a slow, tortuous process. We crept slowly toward therise, our exhilaration soon burning down to a dogged determination.The afternoon shadows found us halfway up. Unwilling to be trappedby nightfall in that hellish landscape, we retreated back the way we had come, to return with renewed zeal the following day. The next day, all the way up the slope, hacking away, I kept think- ing,“What if it isn’t there? What if this is the wrong place? What if weget there but can’t get through the undergrowth?” At last we reachedthe crest, and my worries had been for naught. The view was magnif-icent, stretching away across the deep ravines and hollows. But wehad not come to enjoy the scenic vista. There among the trees lay the last resting place of our ancestors. The deep, rich forest loam cradled the remains of our great-greatgrandmother and her son, who had lain there since the smallpox epi-demic of 1861. So close together in that tiny glade also slept our great-grandparents, their daughter, and a grandchild, as well as others,identity unknown. No marble monuments marked their graves. Athead and foot, humble flat stones taken from the native soil were tilt-ed on end; no engraved names, no epitaphs, no way to know who rest-ed where. Which ones held Rebecca and her small son, StarlingMartin? Where were Jim and Ann and their daughter, Tinny Lillian?What others shared this isolated hilltop aerie?

A dark-mouthed tun-nel, some kind of animal burrow, led downward into the depths of atomb. The living maker had found shelter among the dead. It was peaceful here, quiet except for the wind in the leaves, our voices and movement. We pulled away dead branches and raked backforest detritus from around the stones. Moving the fallen giant wasbeyond our ability, but we did our feeble best to neaten the place, toshow our respect, our bond to these of our blood, whom we had nev-er known, yet somehow knew in our souls. I looked out over the valley beneath. In one of those hollows 150 years ago, there stood a house filled with love, laughter, and children.Those in that house had climbed this hill in sorrowful procession,bringing the cherished remains of those dear to them, to lay themwith much love and dignity to rest beneath the cedar tree. I don’t know what voices from the past called me here, what force impelled me to seek this place, this moment. Surely there must be adeeper meaning. Perhaps we, these granddaughters generations re-moved, may be the last to walk here. Perhaps nature will entirely andfinally take back its own. The leaves will float quietly to the forestfloor, building one upon the other, layer by layer. The stones will sinkever deeper into the soil, into the Earth’s mellow bosom. Other treeswill join the cedar, prostrate and rotting on the ground, their rootsgiving birth to young saplings. Wild things will dig and burrow, deerbrowsing, turkeys scratching for seeds, whippoorwills callingmournful notes on the dusky evening air; until finally, nothing ofmankind will remain. There is only the wind. All earthly remem-brance will have vanished, returned to the dust, completely and for-ever. Is that the message? Our sojourn is soon ended, our bodies gone,all knowledge of our being fading into some dark unknown. I think the wind whispers another message. The love which brought these bodies here so long ago and the strength of will andspirit that brought us, their descendants, to seek them out will liveon; beyond this hilltop, these woods and valleys, beyond these mem-ories, beyond time.

I was invited to dine in the homes of American expats, Palauans, and residentFilipinos and charmed by the friendly openness of most everyone Imet. Although independent since 1994, Palau was a possession of theU.S. after the islands were taken from the Japanese in WWII .T h e country is still financially dependent on the U.S. under a treaty thatprovides $425 million to be paid to Palau over fifteen years. A pecu-liar outgrowth of this post-colonial relationship is that one-third ofresident Palauans work for their government. The government ismodeled on the U.S. with twelve state governments, a bicameral leg-islature, a judiciary, and an executive branch—all for a population of25,000! It has the government of a nation-state for the population ofa small town. The only significant industries are tourism (primarilyscuba diving) and fishing. eddie, a palauan boat captain, told me that Palauans used to be the greatest outrigger sailors in the Pacific, but now “we’re all too lazy to use anything that doesn’t have a motor.” The Filipina staff at myhotel laughed out loud at the idea of paying money to come halfwayaround the world to paddle a kayak in the open sea under a burningsun. Why leave paradise for the uncertainty of the sea? T ony could not find the key to the lock on the expedition kayaks of Blue Planet Outfitters, so I had to settle for an open two-seater,which is fine for day tripping but a bit worrisome for the open sea.Sea kayakers typically wear spray skirts to keep water out of the kayakand life jackets to float out from under a rolled boat. When I askedabout a life jacket and spray skirt, T ony said he’d heard I was a goodswimmer, so he hadn’t reserved one for me. T ony’s “No worries, man”attitude was infectious, so, despite my reservations, I tied the dry bagsfilled with my tent, clothes, and food onto the kayak and pushed itoff the dock. The 18-inch drop into the water and an unhelpful wave knocked everything out of the kayak that wasn’t tied down; camera, binocu-lars, water bottle, and snacks went overboard. I fished my stuff out ofthe water with the paddle, said goodbye to T ony, and paddled off redfaced. After two hours of easy paddling, I was across the harbor and into the Rock Islands. I skirted the east side of Ngeruktabel, a 15-mile-long, twisted serpentine-shaped island and the largest land mass inthe Rock Islands. The waves had been breaking a mile out in the Pacific from the jagged northeast coast of the island, but as I neared the northeastpoint where I would turn south, the waves were breaking closer and"

I turned the kayak sharply left and paddled directly into and over thebreaking waves and then, pumping the steering peddles as fast as Icould to keep from getting rolled, reversed direction to surf the four-foot waves past the rocky point. The kayak didn’t roll, and I found along, sandy beach about a half-mile past the point. “Margie’s Beach” was handwritten on the map I borrowed from T ony. Sitting on the beach drinking gin tonics and enjoying the viewout to sea from “their little slice of paradise” were Margie herself andher friend Bill. Margie is a handsome Palauan woman in her mid-fifties, and Bill, her American friend, is a retired trucker about adecade older. They welcomed me to camp on Margie’s private beach,offered me refreshments from a well-stocked cooler, and fed megrilled fish and ribs. We watched the sun set, told stories of travel andadventure, and laughed till the tears ran at Bill’s truck-driving jokes. I was packed and ready to push off by 9:30 the next morning. Bill warned me to keep the northeast point of Eil Malk to my left and justcruise down its mile-long inlet to the dock below Jellyfish Lake. Hepointed toward a gray hazy speck beyond the rock islands off thesoutheast point of Ngeruktabel,“That is the northeast tip of Eil Malk;you can’t miss it.” The wind was blowing slightly against me, but I had the tide go- ing out, so I paddled straight for the hazy speck. According to themap, the dock at the end of the inlet to Jellyfish Lake should be a ten-mile paddle. If the weather held, it should be a six- to eight-hour pad-dle with generous rest and snack breaks. But the winds grew stronger,and after an hour of paddling storm clouds were building ahead.Three and four-foot waves slapped the prow as the storm closed in. Isteered a course between two rain clouds and only took a mild soak-ing, but fighting the wind and waves was draining. I’d only traveledthree miles in three hours without a break. “Long Lake Beach” wasindicated on the map at the midpoint of the long concave coast ofNgeruktabel, so I steered toward land. It was misty, and little rock is-lands obscured my view of the shore. I found a sheltered inlet androde the waves over a shallow reef onto a wide, sandy beach. I took an hour-long nap under a lean-to, while the remainder of the rainstorm blew by. It was after 1 PMwhen I walked the kayak back over the reef with the tide going out. Given my slow progress in themorning, I was slightly concerned about reaching Jellyfish Lake bysunset at 6 PM.But surely, I thought, I could cover seven miles in five hours. Crossing the Y oo Passage, between the southern tip of Ngeruktabel and the north side of Eil Malk, required paddlingthrough choppy waves and a heavy crosscurrent. As the tide goes out,80 Jeffrey S.

Most of the Rock Islands don’t have beaches because they are limestone mounds covered with heavy vegetation. They were formedfrom a gigantic ancient reef, which eroded leaving a maze of little is-lands clustered around the two large land masses of Ngeruktabel andEil Malk. Pictures from the air and travel brochures liken the RockIslands to a scattering of emeralds on the deep, blue Pacific. At sealevel, they look like hundreds of green umbrellas or otherworldlygreen mushrooms ranging in size from a rock with a shrub on it tothe Super Dome with a green top. By 5 PMI was wearing out from pulling against two- to three-foot swells and fighting the tidal current. It was an hour before sunset. Iwas bothered as much by doubt as weariness. It had been cloudy andmisty all afternoon, and as sundown approached, visibility was get-ting worse. The closer I got to Eil Malk, the less sure I was that I knewwhich point of land I was supposed to keep on my left. On the mapEil Malk looks like three fingers extending north from the palm of ahand, but, with rock islands sprinkled all around the fingers, in themisty dimness of early evening I wasn’t sure which points of landwere fingers of Eil Malk and which were other rock islands. As I started down what I hoped was the inlet to Jellyfish Lake, the sun began to set. I hadn’t planne d on paddling in the dark. I had nev- er paddled after dark before, not even on my own White River backhome in Indiana. The moon had been full the last few nights, buttonight clouds blotted out the moonlight. I paddled for an hour, andthe land on my left disappeared in the darkness. Not because of thedarkness, but because it was a long rock island I had mistaken for theouter finger of Eil Malk. I could now hear the surf breaking on theouter reef as the vast grayness of the Pacific and the darkness of thesky enveloped everything to my left. The lights of a freighter movingslowly toward Koror blinked through the darkness miles away. I couldmake out the tree line on my right and could clearly hear the slap ofwaves against the limestone wall of the Pacific side of Eil Malk. I cra-dled the paddle on my knees, opened a dry bag, and got out a head-lamp. I scanned the shore for a place to beach the kayak, but therewasn’t any. I paddled on desperate to find a place I could beach thekayak and rest. Eventually, a white spot appeared in the dimness ahead, so I pad- dled toward it. The white spot took the shape of a 30-foot fishing boat half sunk on its port side with waves slapping against its hull. A smallbeach was visible just beyond the sunken hulk. Happily I steered pastthe white hull and rode the waves onto the beach.81 Passage through Palau"

I considered tying the kayak to the trunk of a palm tree and riding outthe high tide in the kayak. But I was afraid the wave action would rollthe kayak and tumble my gear and me into the surf. Louder than the slap of waves on sand was an eerie groaning noise coming from the half-sunken boat. It sounded like the wheez-ing of an ancient bellows or the death rattle of some giant monster.The mournful groaning of the white hulk was too much—I retiedgear onto the kayak.

I’m not sure my thought process wasvery clear, but the only way out of the predicament I could think ofwas to try to paddle back to where I missed the turn for Jellyfish Lake. Heading north, I could hear the surf breaking on the outer reef 50 or 60 yards to my right. I could see a dim outline of trees and heardthe slap of waves on limestone on my left. I had to steer a course be-tween the surf breaking on the outer reef and the waves breaking onthe wall at the base of the island. I was scared and crying and cursingmyself for my navigational stupidity and the perversity that wouldtake me from hearth and home to be paddling a kayak by myself inthe Pacific Ocean at night! I was physically exhausted and knew thatI did not have the energy left to make the hard two-hour paddle toreach the safety of Jellyfish Lake dock. Suddenly, I felt somethingbump the bottom of the kayak, and shark terror entered the mix ofroiling emotion, recrimination, and exhaustion. My arms were trembling from the exertion of pulling through 3- foot waves against a head wind. My chest was heaving as my lungstried to replenish my spent muscles with oxygen. My heart waspounding with fear—fear that I could not continue paddling for twohours and fear that the kayak would tip, and I would be in the darkwater alone, like Jonah, except for the monster that bumped the bot-tom of the boat. I stopped paddling, rested the paddle on my lap, began to try to control my breathing, and calm myself. The kayak rose and fell withthe rolling waves. I started singing the two hymns we sing in churchevery Sunday, the “Gloria Patri” and the “Doxology,” hymns I havesung since I was a small child pressed warmly against the side of myGreat-Grandmother in the hardwood pews of our little church inGoshen, Indiana. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost; As it was in the beginning, is now and ever shall be,World without end. A-men, A–men82 Jeffrey S. Rasley"

On mountaineering expeditions in Nepal, Sherpa guides taught me to chant Buddhist mantras. Chanting a mantra frees the mind of nervous energy, allows the body to move spontaneously, and takesone out of time to reduce the drudgery of a long trek or climb. I ap-plied what I’d learned from the Sherpas but used the Christianmantras of my childhood. The panicky buzzing in my mind began toebb, the tightness in my muscles relaxed, and I let go of the self-abuseI’d heaped on myself. An incredible lightness entered my body, and Ifelt as fresh and strong as if I’d just started paddling. I was infusedwith what I can only describe as a divine, inhuman energy. A spiritgreater than my own was with me, in me. It felt like I could paddle allnight long. Ninety minutes later, as I rounded the point I’d earlier missed, the clouds opened like a theater curtain being drawn back. The moonmade its first appearance of the evening, lighting up mangrove rootsoverhanging the limestone edge of the island and shimmering on thesurface of the rippling water. As I entered the inlet to Jellyfish Lake,it felt like two arms of Eil Malk embraced me. The water in the inletwas as calm as a pond in Indiana. I was lost and now, by what seemedlike an amazing grace, I was safe. I straddled the kayak with my legs Approaching Eil Malk. Photograph by JeffreyRasley."

The next morning I stuffed my snorkel gear and snacks in a day- pack and picked my way up a rocky trail through thick vegetation andover a hill to a pier at the side of Jellyfish Lake. I pulled on my maskand fins and giant-stepped off the end of the pier into the 80-degreewater. I spent the morning swimming among the jellyfish. The jelly-fish are either oblivious or attracted to swimmers because they keptbumping up against me as they glided about in their peculiar hump-ing motion. I ate lunch on the pier around noon and then hiked backto my tent. The three-day paddle back to Koror was fairly easy. I spent the fi- nal night in the Rock Islands camped on the north side ofNgeruktabel on a crumbling limestone dock, built by the Germansbefore Palau was taken over by the Japanese in 1914. Before sundownI explored bunkers dug into the hillside above the dock and the rust-ed remains of Japanese WWII armaments. My tent was pitched in a secluded cove, so I celebrated the final night of the kayak adventureby swimming naked and sitting on the edge of the dock in the moon-light listening to birds calling from the surrounding jungle. Jellyfish Lake is emblematic of the perilous paradise that is Palau. Swimming in the lake I bobbed and weaved with the gentle jellies fortwo hours—they bumped and nuzzled me and left no welts becausethey do not sting. They are simple beauty, like most of Palau. Thebeauty of the moonlit inlet with the arms of Eil Malk embraced meand the Pacific water in which I dangled my feet as I leisurely pad-dled past mangrove-lined shores. The generosity and kindness to strangers, the sensitivity and care for their strangely beautiful Rock Islands and unique ecology, and themany diverse peoples living peacefully together in this small islandnation—this is Palau. But, the terrible darkness enveloping the vastgray waters of the Pacific as waves slapped my little craft and crashedagainst the limestone walls on the Pacific side of Eil Malk, while a seamonster bumped the underside of the boat—this is also Palau. Abeautiful and frightening paradox—like human life itself. jeffrey s. rasley has twice returned to Palau to solo sea-kayak in the Rock Islands. In October 2002 he paddled from Koror to Peleliu without getting lost. Locals told him that they don’t remember anyone else solo kayaking theentire span of the island chain.84 Jeffrey S. Rasley"

I am horrified. As the lock yields, I feel his head against my neck. His breath is nauseating. He hasn’t brushed his teeth in months. “Y ou are the Key to the Kingdom,” he laughs and gropes for my hand at the lock. My fear is rising. Just last month, in a rage over a new antipsy- chotic medication, this strong, young man grabbed my tie and dragged me by the neck halfway across the bottom panel of the Dutchdoor that separates the staff room from the ward. Orderlies freed meand muscled him to the floor. Since the near strangling I’ve been tensearound him. Minutes earlier I had been studying the black rockets and fiery alien suns he’d scrawled across the whiteboard above his bed. Mythoughts were that these images suggested that this once shy, fanci-ful boy and now visionary madman were one and the same.Unfortunately, my interpretation backfired, and I became moredrawn into his psychotic world. In part, I took this interpretive risk because I’m desperate. My tour of duty in this asylum in nearly over, and in the two years I’veworked within these crumbling granite walls, I’ve not moved thisyoung man a step closer to discharge. Collapsing a boundary betweenus, I’ve lost the protection of my professional distance. Through thegaping hole in the doctor–patient relationship, I am being suckedinto the whirlpool of my patient’s dream of our shared messianicidentity. Sighing with guilt and regret, I slip through the door to theabandoned ward beyond. “Come back, Dr. Christ!” my patient moans. His words slur and mute as he flattens his face against the door’s Plexiglas window.Glancing back at the small rectangle of light I see the backlit halo ofhis wild dark hair. Mentally plugging my ears and striding toward a metal door at the far wall, I skid on fallen ceiling plaster. Housekeeping has notcleaned this ward in months. Reaching the door, I twist a silver key inthe lock. The door opens with a squeak, and I bound through it andscramble down a spiral staircase. At ground level the same silver keyopens a third door. I swing it wide open and step out of the suffocat-ing darkness of the asylum into the spacious, brilliant light of spring. At my back the gray granite hospital slouches along the eastern rim of the deep river valley.Across the valley, among a canopy of new-ly green trees, rises the shining dome of Maine’s capitol building, itsairy lightness contrasting against the dark bulk of the old mental hos- Opposite: William Trost Richards.

Built as a trendsetting site for “moral treatment” in the enlight- ened period before the Civil War, this asylum has become, like mostof its kind, a symbol of alienation, imprisonment, even terror.Patients’ rights groups stridently lobby to empty it and tear it down.Y esterday, I watched activists fervently search the grounds for un-marked graves of patients who died here, forgotten by their families.Ultimately these activists will prevail, but for the moment the hospi-tal remains the only possible place I can treat a patient as persistent-ly psychotic as the young man now calling me Dr. Christ. Calmed by the illusion of separation offered by three metal doors and foot-thick stone walls, I slowly cross a hundred yards of mani-cured lawn and push into knee-high grasses of a meadow. I experi-ence a deeply satisfying synesthesia as the aromas of sweet flowersand ripe spring earth blend with the nearly palpable sonorous saw-ing of the crickets. In the valley below, the riffs of the river sparkle as it works its way toward the sea. The ribbon of light winds through hillsides of green-ing maples and oaks, and its glistening surface so enchants me thatfor a moment I think I can reach out and dip my finger into its lumi-nous wetness. However, a lingering claustrophobia pushes the danc-ing light away, making it almost unreachable. This claustrophobia is not just the residue of my current stress. It is also the chronic mindset of asylum psychiatrists, like me, whomust clinically objectify our patients’ wild subjectivities and person-ally detach from their extraordinary revelations. This stance allowsus to be both helpful and “sane,” but in doing so we slide capstonesover the deep wells of our own souls. The result is that slowly, overthe years, many of us lose all sense of mystery. Most days I accept thisnecessary numbness, but today the claustrophobia is unbearable.Although my body is now outside the asylum walls, my soul remainsnarcotized within. I am held prisoner by the morbidity of my train-ing, experience, and professional responsibility. Hoping to shake off this pall, I stand in the sweet, buzzing mead- ow and recall the irony of my choice of psychiatry. As a fourth-yearmedical student on psychiatric rotation in a North Philadelphia hos-pital, I witnessed an Afro-American preacher’s wife sing out her man-ic vision of heavenly fire, and, I confess, I was fascinated, even trans-ported. Despite my clinical understanding of the woman’s mental ill-ness, I envied her soul’s larger-than-life experience of a world I couldneither see nor hear. The power of her wailing vision was so passion-ate that I could not believe it to be entirely fantasy. Surely her psy-chosis was an open door to God, and I, like her, wanted to witnesswhat lay on the other side. This morning, however, my patient’s false90 Walter R. Christie"

Feeling the warmth of the sunlight, I search for the right mental attitude. My mind directs me to imagine myself growing smaller. Iwant to be the size of a figure in a Taoist painting—a tiny speck ofperson in a vast, breathing, mysterious universe, yet not so small thatI lose my discrete sense of being. Like Ralph Waldo Emerson, who in-tuited that individual minds can access universal mind, I want to find“a place to stand.” From his “stand,” Emerson read the hieroglyphicsof nature, saw beyond the senses, dreamed beyond the stars. Breathing deeply to quiet my racing mind, I listen to the splash- es of the river rushing over mossy boulders and small ledges.Delighted with these sounds, my mind empties itself of everythingbut the river music. Emptying and listening—this preparation for re-newal—is something I should do much more often. T oday I do it be-cause I must. Rivers are important to me. I was born next to the Penobscot, and I have loved my whole life the great rivers of Maine. I have canoedtheir waters, hiked their banks, and contemplated their watersheds.The river below me, the Kennebec, flows through this green valley,and by virtue of my love and study of it, it also flows through mymemory. Trusting my imagination, I drift back a couple of months to when the forest still lay buried in snow. As my imagination wings westwardtoward the origins of the river, I see deer huddled in the alder thick-ets and here and there a fox or coyote wandering in search of snow-shoe hare. Commanding the skyline in the far west lie thePresidentials, massive in winter’s frozen quietude, their peaks andglacial cirques mounded with deep snow. I’ve discovered that moving water restores me. It is mid-April as my imagination glides toward the mountains where the spring melthas just begun.Along the sheer faces of the peaks, glacier-cold rivuletsshoot from the snow pack and fall hundreds of feet to burst into rain-bows of spray. In the basins rivulets gather into small creeks thatbound down the hillsides where in the dark conifers below they joinothers, leaping from the forest in every direction. In the ponds andlakes the spring flood lifts the ice, and its crystalline plates and slabsgrow porous, cachectic. The hollowing ice sinks, melts, and shatters,tipping and rising up the trunks of cedars and hemlocks along theshores.

Watching the power of this vision, I respectfully remain in my “place to stand.” Soon the roar increases to a cavernous din, and theriver is no longer “out there” but is all around me. In my mind an un-seen force suddenly plunges me into the icy water. As the cresting spring flood rushes toward the falls, the quick cur- rent spins me and floats me backward. Glancing to the right, I see mypatient. His eyes are wide as he thrashes in the current. His nose andlips have turned blue. His matted dark hair droops over his eyes. I callto him, but he cannot hear me above the roar of the falls. Fearing forhis safety, I fling an outstretched hand in his direction, but it is toolate, for I am swept over the lip of the falls and find myself tumblingdownward amidst thundering cascades of water. As I drop, face sky-ward, I see my patient’s body darken the heavens above me as he, too,is flung over the roaring rim. For a moment, we are both falling to-ward the great frothy eddy at the base of the pounding columns of water. I hit the eddy with a stinging smack and immediately am sucked down into the darkness of the freezing, slow-spinning gyre. Mychilled body sinks like lead, and I fear I will drown, but thankfully Isuddenly pop to the surface just outside the deadly whirlpool.Anxiously, I scan the boiling current for my patient. Around me thewater flashes silver with scales of Atlantic salmon. Light glints offtheir sleek bodies as they beat their way up the falling cascades. Thebeauty of the ascending fish is so spellbinding that for a moment Ilose my fear. Suddenly a large body brushes next to me, and my fearreturns with a new eeriness. The body is that of a huge sturgeon, per-haps fifteen feet long, the size described by early explorers. In someway I know this fish is my patient. The sturgeon twists briefly in the foaming current and turns one eye toward me. Strange, eel-like feelers dangle from its jaw. Thecracked armored plates of its back are studded with barnacles andwavering threads of algae, and in its eye I see the black hole of eter-nity. The fish stares at me for a few seconds, then coils and leapsstraight skyward into the pounding water. It seems inconceivable thata creature of such size can ascend the falls, and I fear the ancient fishwill crash back upon me. Then, as if the falling cascade reversed itselfto assist, the huge body splashes up and over the falls. In the spacewhere the fish cleared the rim, droplets hang suspended in the air,their surfaces refracting the bright daylight. From my vantage pointbelow, these glistening spheres seem like galaxies of burning suns. Ishut my eyes in disbelief.92 Walter R. Christie"

A pink clover blos-som pushes itself into my palm, and I bend to smell its sweetness.Emerson spoke of miracles being one with blowing clover and rain.He said that religion must be imagined and reimagined over again tokeep its fresh relationship with divine reality. It is so lovely here in themeadow, so sweet, so uncomplicated, and blessedly I have a time, per-haps ten minutes, just to rest and to reflect. Of course, I cannot for-get that inside the granite walls my patient waits for me, and as doc-tor and patient, we remain bound together by our need to transformeach other. In my mind I hear him mumbling, “Christ, i.e., that is,Christ.” T en minutes is not much time, but I think it will be enoughto let the river’s miracle do its work. Smelling the clover again I think of how our inflated souls, his made grandiose by illness and mine pumped up by fear and thera-peutic zeal, can be balanced again by growing small in the face ofoverpowering largeness. I reflect on the religious imagination and theparadox of how as much as we need ritual, predictability, and thesafety of spiritual certainty, sometimes rebirth requires surprise andthe possibility of death. It is as if we need the divine to appear in to-tally unexpected form in order to achieve the necessary renewal.Ironically we need our estranged complexity to be nearly killed tofind our simple selves again. Musing on these thoughts, I rest in thesunlit meadow. The fullness of the moment is deeply relaxing, but I cannot es- cape the threads of anxiety that loop through my mind. Soon I mustgo back into the unreal atmosphere of the old asylum where my ther-apeutic clumsiness has made my patient more psychotic than ever,perhaps more dangerous. Miraculously, I feel strong enough to sitwith him again. The double river has given me fresh vision, and vi-sion is the spawning ground of hop e—hope for him, hope for me.

I would get the story firsthand in a while—why think about the same problem twice? It could be a whole differ-ent problem once I got there anyway, or no problem at all. MaybeGram was just feeling lonely—I’d ge t there and she’d put out some fresh-baked cookies and a glass of milk and never once mention anyraccoon.

Thehouse is a mess with torn bags and crumbles of cookies, but they’recookies that had been in those bags, the store-bought kind.Also sometorn-up candy wrappers and remains of chocolate. “The first time it happened, I pretended it was a squirrel,” Gramma tells me. I can picture her doing that, trying to ignore factsso she wouldn’t have to deal with them. “But even a squirrel would be bad,” she goes on. “How would a squirrel get in here? I’d have to hire people to come and find out, thenother people to get rid of them.” “But now you don’t think so?” I ask, looking around at the mess.“No. Now I think it’s something coming in the cat door.” She points at the hole in the back door with a heavy plastic floppy open-er.

The plastic door begins to move out—I mean away from the inside of the house, not toward it like a cat pushing her way in. It pulls back further, and we see littletiny black fingers pulling on it. Then this face appears in the opening, black eyes and a mask around them—like a comic-book robber, andthe face moving through the hole.

It might betoo small for him, but it’s worth a try.” She fiddles with some latch-type hooks and puts it on the floor. I have my doubts. I mean, if I were a raccoon, I don’t think I’d go inthere for old half-eaten cookies. While she’s messing with it, I keeppicturing that face in that frame of plastic. It was a face a lot biggerthan the cat’s face and must be in a head a lot bigger than the cat’shead. Maybe that plastic cat door is too big for Gram’s cat. Finally Itell her what I’m thinking. “Y ou could go to the store and get a smaller cat door,” I tell her.Gram finishes up with the trap and looks at the door.“Y ou’re right,” she tells me. It feels good to have her say that, but then when I think about the big project of changing the cat door, itseems like too much. Gram disappears again. This time she comesback with a hammer and some nails. Who would have thought she’dhave that kind of stuff around? Then she reaches into the kindlingpile and pulls out a skinny little board. “Y ou hold this,” she says, laying it across the plastic of the cat door, about halfway up. So I do. I’d rather do the hammering, butshe’s good at that too. A few whacks and that board is nailed in sol-id. “I hope we guessed the right spacing,” she says.

For three days I glimpsed the cat in streaks as she dashed into hiding behind bushes when I drove into the driveway. It wasn’tworth keeping the raccoon out if it meant losing the cat. I removedthe second strip and looked for other solutions: I e-mailed Fish &Wildlife for suggestions; I ordered two new cat doors from the internet—one that would fit into the sliding glass door on the oppo-site side of the house and one that would only open if the approach-ing entrant had a magnet hanging from its collar; I went to the hard-ware store and spent $45 on a raccoon sized Havahart trap—a trapfour feet long and a foot square. I was willing to try anything, and Iwas going to try it all. I put the trap in the shed outside the backdoor, the location of the cat door, and loaded it with the same cookies the raccoon hadbeen stealing, along with jelly beans left over from Easter and a fewof the peanuts. The next morning, the kitchen was a mess again. Bread had been dug out of the flip-top trash can, and a package of those orange crack-ers filled with peanut butter had been messily consumed. I opened the back door to check the trap. The bait was gone, the door clampedshut, but the trap was empty. Somehow the raccoon had tricked it.I’d paid a bundle for that trap and couldn’t believe it hadn’t worked. I decided to try it one more time. This time the bait was more of the bread from the trash, more of the orange crackers, and anothersampling of Easter candy. Just in case he’d gotten free by tipping itover, I put a four-foot beam across the top of the cage. The next morning, my cat woke me in bed.

I called my next-door neighbor who, worried about the future of his chickens, had agreed to drive the raccoon far away if I managedto catch it. T ogether we got the cage, snarling threatening raccoon andall, into his jeep. I went off to work with a smile on my face. I slept soundly that night. But the next morning the familiar bed- lam was back. The cat-food bag was torn open, the contents rollingunder my bare feet, more of the orange cracker crumbs littered therug. “How could this be?” And from somewhere beneath the sleep came the response: raccoons are families. “Oh, no!” I answered out loud along with some other stronger words. I prepared to set the trap again. I wanted to get it right. Would a second raccoon go into a cage where his brother had spent the night?Presumably peed? I got out the hose and scrubbed the cage.

Then the bait, the four-foot beam, and thetrap was ready. That night when I went to bed, my cat joined me. I took the cat’s presence inside as an invitation to once again block any entry throughthe cat door, so I slipped downstairs, hammer in hand, and re-nailedthe second board. The next morning? Y es! A second furry bundle was in the cage. Another neighbor driving by in his truck saw me struggling to get thecage with the fighting raccoon out of the shed. He stopped to helpand took it with him in his truck to Claremont. He and I both agreedthat Claremont needed more raccoons. When I got home from work that evening, I smiled at the empty cage on my front steps. Then I got busy with the hose, rake, garbagebags, and jellybeans. Who knew how long this would go on? But I hadthe hang of it now. Two days later I had to call work to say I’d be in a little late. I had another raccoon to get rid of. T om had taken away that first one. Bobfrom up the road had taken the second. I had called both T om andBob for this one, but neither had answered. A few minutes later, as I was lugging the cage, clumsy with the frantic movement of the raccoon, Bob stopped by. “Got your message,” he told me, grabbing the cage and putting it into the bed of his pickup. “I’m on my way to Claremont,” he said,grinning. He was happy—and I was happy: raccoon trapper extraor-dinaire. Queen Trapper of Davidson Hill. I told Jeanine the story when I got to work.“Y ou know, that’s not the end of them,” she told me. “Well, there might be one, even two, more,” I admitted. “A fami- ly of raccoons can have up to five.” “Y ou think it’s just one family?” she asked. “Word is out by now. Every raccoon in those woods knows about your house—the place togo to party! Y our house is the Raccoon Frat House of North Westminster.” three weeks after i drove the fourth raccoon to Fitzwilliam, just as I was beginning to relax, believing myself to be raccoon-free, I was sitting on my couch, lighthearted, reading a novel and eating someice cream, when I heard a disheartening sound from the vicinity ofthe cat door. Soon I heard a rustling sound. I pictured the shelf whereI keep my teas. I screamed and threw my novel across the room intothe kitchen. Dead silence followed and then a repeat of the scratchywhoosh of an oversized raccoon fitting through an undersized cat"

For a couple days, I reset and baited the trap, but without gusto. I was tired of catching raccoons. The thrill had worn off. I hatched a new plan. Outside the door I built a cinder-block bar- rier: cinder blocks on each side of the cat opening, tight up againstthe door, connected with a double-sized cinder-block across their farsides. This configuration left a well that a cat could climb down intoand make her way into the house, but the squiggle factor might beenough to deter a shifty raccoon who didn’t know what was waitingin those depths. It seemed to work. The invasions ceased. I still kept the trap set and ready to capture, but the bait slowly disappeared, probably tak-en by chipmunks and mice. After a while I quit re-baiting and keptthinking I should release the trigger and be done with it for awhile.The cinder-block barrier was doing its job. Several weeks went by when, sitting quietly one evening, I heard a suspicious noise. I got up to look. The flap was still. On a whim Idecided to peek outside. As I stood sniffing the air, I heard movement in the shed. I switched on the light and peered into the shed’s shadows. The cagedoor was closed! And there was movement inside—a frantic pacingmovement. It wasn’t quite right, though. This dark form seemed hy-per: too prancing, too skittish. The raccoons of the past had beenmore deliberate, more lumbering, their bearing more confrontation-al. I got my flashlight. Shining it into the shadows, squinting to seebehind the woven wires of the cage, the beam caught black fur—butlongish fur—not the bristles of a raccoon. Had I caught a cat? Iinched closer and the light caught whiteness as well, a long tail as theanimal scurried back and forth, frantic for escape. More white? Ilooked closer—a long snout and yes, a lot of white—a whole whitestripe. I ran back into the house and slammed the door. How wouldI ever get rid of a skunk? Colin “okay, so you caught a skunk in the trap . So what’d you do?” “Well, I sat on the couch to think about it. The first thing I thought was, ‘I’m glad he wasn’t as surprised and freaked out as meor he would have sprayed me.’” “Y eah, but he couldn’t. He was in a cage,” I tell her.“But it’s not a skunk trap. It’s much bigger than a skunk trap. So I was worried. They don’t spray when they’re in a cage because theycan’t lift their tails high enough. But with a cage that size—well, histail seemed to be sticking up pretty well.”"

Sometimes she just gets these ideas in her head and believes them, and I have to straighten her out. “They don’t spraywhen they’re in a cage or anysmall enclosed area. That’s the way of skunks.” “Why?” she asks.“I don’t know. They just don’t. So what’d youdo?” “Well, first I thought I’d go to bed,” she says, “but then I knew I couldn’t. I don’t hate skunks like I do raccoons. He hadn’t done any-thing to me—I couldn’t just leave him stuck in there. So then Ithought that I should wrap myself all up somehow, maybe with anold overcoat or something. Then I thought about my eyes and won-dered if I had goggles anywhere.” I laugh, picturing her.“I ran through a ton of ideas, but they all seemed pretty compli- cated. Like if I put on gloves, maybe I couldn’t work the latch on thecage. And wrapping myself up would make a quick escape hard.Finally, without any of those, I got up to take another look. By then Iwas wondering if maybe I could just ease the cage open a couple inch-es, then prop it like that, and go back in the house.” “So is that what you did?”“It’s what I started to do. I got a piece of wood that was about the right height and walked real slowly over to the cage. He skitteredaround at first but then calmed down some. I was really just inching along. Then I reached over and opened the latch, but you have to holdthe latch up in the air to start collapsing the door up toward the topof the cage, which takes two hands. I was holding the latch with onehand and sliding the door with the other. If I let go of the latch, thedoor would stop moving, so I just kept sliding the door all the wayopen and held it there. The skunk poked his head though the open-ing, and I moved off to the side as far as I could, hoping he wouldn’tnotice me. Maybe he’d think a miracle had happened. He’d be easy tofool. Anyone who’d voluntarily go into an unbaited trap couldn’t beall that bright.” “Y eah, so then . . .” I have to prompt.“So he came out. He took a tiny glance around and then moved quickly across the shed and disappeared under the joists.” “Well, I guess that’s a happy ending,” I tell her, “Although some spraying would have made it a lot more interesting.” charlene wakefield is a writer and visual artist living in Westminster, Vermont.

Life expectancy is eighteen to twenty years, and death of-ten occurs during status epilepticus—grand mal seizure after grand mal that won’t stop until death brings relief. Perry and Betty have tried every experimental medical interven- tion and anti-seizure med on the market. They have worked withcountless neurologists and medical clinics. Andy even had a vagusnerve stimulator implanted with the hope of fragmenting impend-ing seizures. Nothing has helped. Every procedure has side effects.Little Andy has been subject to obesity, violent outbursts, andCushing’s syndrome (from massive infusion of steroids). He experi-enced mental terror from one drug and bizarre activity, sleeplessness,and restlessness from another drug, frantic hunger from special diet. . . the list goes on and on. When Andy was about four, I watched his cloudy gaze suddenly focus. He walked away from everyone, zeroed in on the nothingnessbefore him, and began to speak in a rapid dialect. His mother said thedoctors felt this behavior was from hallucinations. I am a registerednurse and find this plausible, but I said aloud that Andy may be gift-ed and, who knows, may be speaking to God or angels. As I spoke,Andy turned, looked at me and smiled. The following year I again flew to Iowa to visit my parents. My brother’s family lives nearby and frequently drops in.

I looked back and smiled. Neither ofus would give up the intense gaze. His mother asked softly, “What’sgoing on?” I replied in a whisper, “I don’t know.” Although I only visited annually,Andy remembered me each and every year. His normally blank expression would brighten, and hewould continue the affectionate hugs. During my daily prayer andmeditation time back in New Hampshire, I frequently saw his faceand “felt” his big smile. Sometimes I could even hear his voice, al-though it was the tone of a young man, rather than a child. I chosenot to dismiss or evaluate Andy’s appearance or voice in my medita-tion. It just was. Back to Iowa at my parents’ golden anniversary party, Perry walked into the hall holding ten-year-old Andy escorted by two EMTS . In the process of getting out of the car and into the building, my nephew had suffered multiple grand mal seizures. Andy was understandably dazed and sleepy.Y et, when he saw me, he struggled from his father’s arms and stumbled into mine, huggingfiercely. I heard interiorly that young male voice,“Please thank them.”Then, he fell asleep. Alone later that evening as I meditated, a young male voice fired instructions to me. The messages were insistent and would not stop.Finally, I acknowledged the words and promised to relay the messagesif the opportunity arose. The mental noise subsided. The next day we were all assembled at church, where my parents would repeat their wedding vows. I watched Andy in the seat beforeme, cradled in my brother’s arms. His head turned toward me. Andy’seyes and mine locked in an intense gaze. The meditative voice began.The young male voice was insistent. I started to cry and in my mind,agreed. After Mass, all assembled at my parents’ home. My mother took Andy outside to the swing. I asked to talk privately to Betty. She fol-lowed me into the bedroom. I told Andy’s mother that I was about to say something very ir- responsible. That I wasn’t a psychic or medium, but it seemed that Iwas communicating with Andy, and he wanted me to say something. “When he stares at me, I hear a young man’s voice say, ‘Thank them.’ It has become insistent the more he hugs me.

Then I cried out,“Oh God, help me do this right. I’m not do-ing this right. If I’m meant to do this help me!” As my own tears fell,I looked out the window and saw Andy playing with his grandma. Heturned toward the window. I heard the voice again, “T ell them thankyou.” Calmness permeated the room. “The most compelling and profound message that keeps coming from Andy,”I said,“is thank you. He knows how hard his life has beenfor you. He wants to thank you for all that you have done for him. Heloves you. Y ou are very special, chosen parents.” After a noncommittal sigh, Betty hugged me and left the room.I looked out the bedroom window and watched as my mother walked hand-in-hand with Andy back to the house. In a while, Bettyknocked on the bedroom door and walked in. “I just think that you should know . . . after our talk, your moth- er brought Andy into the house. He ran up to me, hugged me andsaid, “Thank you mama, thank you mama, thank you mama.” ThenBetty paused.“Andy’s vocabulary has become very limited. This is thefirst time he has spoken this year.” What is Andy all about? For what purpose did this devastating disease happen to such an innocent, precious child? Only God reallyknows. Some would call Andy a suffering servant. T o me, that meansthat Andy is a very advanced soul, very precious to God. He was al-lowed to sacrifice his own life in order to bring about deep spiritualchange in people. When I see Andy, it is most clear to me that his purpose in life is to invoke compassion. The world today is in dire need of this holyemotion. Andy is leaving seeds of love and warmth wherever he goes.As a suffering servant, this evolved soul knew his life would be hard-est on his parents. Only very special people could support and lovehim through this agonizing physical deterioration that was necessaryto fill his purpose in life. After my flight back to New Hampshire, my thoughts remained with Andy and his family. I would second–guess myself. Did I do theright thing . . . even though in my heart, I felt that God had used meto convey Andy’s thoughts? But were these Andy’s thoughts?

He still experiences multiple grand mal seizures daily despite meds, treatment, and vagus nerve stimulator. His bright eyes have dulled and no longer seem to recognize me.

I held Andy awkwardly for over an hour,meditating, offering hands-on prayer, feeling love and grace cascadeover us. There was peace. I was a little sad that he no longer commu-nicates with me via that young man’s inner dialogue. Then I realizedhe is becoming that young man whose voice I heard a half decade ago. Back in New Hampshire I settled down to meditate and was star- tled by an interior vision. In my mind’s eye there stood a tall, thin,handsome man wearing a three-piece blue suit and red tie. He hadlight brown curly hair and was gorgeous—with the kindest face andmost beautiful smile. It was Andy. He seemed to be in his twenties.For two weeks whenever I closed my eyes in prayer, Andy would bethere. Whenever I asked him a question, he would just smile. Messagedelivered, never again was that young man’s voice heard, but thematching spirit was now revealed. Beautiful. Whole. My priest friend listens to my meditative visions and reminds me that mysticism is a glimpse into spiritual reality not readily seen inthis world. He verifies that perhaps what I’m being gifted with is a vi-sion of Andy’s soul, which is very much whole. Another letter from Iowa reveals that Andy’s quiet gifts continue in his silence.

Around fifty, tall but hunchy and thickset, Harold came from the sur-rounding farm country, with that country’s musty fixedness abouthim. Just turned twenty, not tall and one hundred thirty pounds, I wasfrom the city, a university student soaked in the subversive sixties. Harold and I worked the four to midnight shift, stuck side by side on our steel stools, hourly-waged attendants to King Conveyor Belt.In the pre-Christmas production push, the line carried an endlesscurrent of toys, each needing some final human touch. We complet-ed pull-along dogs by stretching rubber ears over steel pegs; we qual-ity checked little wind-up radios by listening to the first bar of Old McDonald 5,000 times a night; we gave voice to toy barns by snap- ping in diaphragms so the swinging doors opened with a milk cow’smoo. After nineteen years of this, Harold, like the other old-timers,worked with the unthinking look of a zombie. I endured each eight-hour shift fortified by the saving grace that I was just passing through. Harold didn’t talk much and shared his fellow lifers’ parochial dislike for peak-season hires. But he liked me. He liked how I knewsomething of World War II. He liked how I taped Shakespeare’s son-nets to my stool seat and furtively studied them while my handsworked. He’d thought he’d seen everything, but said that was a newone. When he did talk, it was a far way from my erudite professorslecturing on Marx and Nietzsche. Most nights I was happy for theconversation. In early November, the company handed out frozen turkeys—a one-time Thanksgiving balm for our full-time $2.65 per hour ex-ploitation. I gave my Butterball to Harold. It surprised me how heturned mum and red-faced, like a shy little boy. He shook my handso hard the little bones hurt for a month. He insisted that come Fridayhe’d buy me a beer. Friday, when the wall clock’s stubborn minute hand needed just a last click to reach twelve, Harold stood up, slapped me on the shoul-der, and said, “Jimmy, it’s midnight.” Then, he whispered, “Let’s getout of here.” I always played it cool at quitting time, sitting still, avoiding the herd. That night Harold tucked me in front and claimed our way. Ifelt diminished, being part of the lemming-like rush to punch out,jostling for position with the tough, proletarian women who domi-nated the crews.

I followed Harold through thefront door into the immediate stink of tobacco smoke and a long,narrow room with a bar along the left side. Tables, chairs, and an oldpuck-sliding bowling machine were on the right. Our first few stepsslanted noticeably uphill, the rough planked wooden floor not level.Harold waved me to come along faster.An old lady sat behind the bar,and two farmers sat on stools in front. At the end, a tall, perfectlyheaded draft beer already awaited Harold. We took the last two stools, and the farmers nodded to Harold. The bartender became aware of me and stood up. Harold bought mea beer. On the bar between the farmers stood a big glass jar with somekind of wrinkled sausages floating inside, like specimens preservedfor science. A cold spot of despair moved through me. I always al-lowed my surroundings undue influence. I tried to strengthen myselfand wondered again how I got into such situations. Harold finished two tall ones to my short one. He didn’t let me buy him a beer because I worked nights to pay for daytime college.He thought that was a special thing. “They can never take it awayfrom you,” he said, meaning the degree. When he said it, it madesense. Harold asked the bartender,“Dottie, what kind of soup you have tonight?” That brought laughs from the farmers and a smile fromDottie. His soup question was a long-running inside joke because theanswer,“Honey, I’ve got split pea soup,” never changed. I think it wascanned soup, but Dottie served it on a silver tray with salt crackers,napkin, spoon, and pepper as if it were a feast for Harold, a hero wel-comed home from great triumphs. After the soup and more beer, Harold shared his dream with me. I would never have guessed it, not in a million years. He yearned tocatch a sailfish. I don’t think he had a clue about deep-sea fishing oth-er than what he saw on The American Sportsman, but just talking about it made his eyes moist and sparkly. He stopped talking aboutit abruptly after a ritual promise to himself that he would do it. Itseemed kind of pitiful to me, especially compared to my lofty dreamof taking the road less traveled and escaping the life of quiet desper-ation—becoming immortal through my pen. During Harold’s trips to the unheated bathroom, the farmers talked about him. “Old man Crowldart’s boy. He’ll be right there onthat same stool until three o’clock. Stay while Dottie cleans up.”110 James Ward"

The temporary workers were all let go at the end of November, just before we had the required weeks to collect unemployment. Theweek before Christmas, I studied late every night for finals.

A year later, graduated, snow-birding in a tiny rented cabin in Winter Haven, Florida, I got a note from a friend who was workingthe assembly-line job. He remembered my mentioning Harold andnow, he wrote, Harold Crowldart was dead. From a heart attack or astroke. Talk was, he died right at the bar in the Indian Head Inn. Ihadn’t thought about Harold since the old days, but I felt bad. I imag-ined a mess with the pea soup.

But something tugged me to the fishing trip. Five or six of us went out on a small charter boat. It was 102° with rough seas. I got sick. No one caught anything but, lying on the opendeck, sunbaked and miserable, I managed to lift my head from undera wet towel just long enough to glimpse a sailfish running alongsidethe boat. Back under the towel, I prayed for a speedy return to land.I thought of Harold and built a hot, teary anger against him for hav-ing such a foolish dream. james ward’ sfirst published short story appeared in Volume 7 of the Chrysalis Reader, Rocking the Ages.

She was elderly, thick around the middle,with fleshy arms and legs protruding from her white cotton dress. Herbody was strung along two lines: the lower, from her heels throughher locked knees to the small of her back, and the upper, doublingback downward at an acute angle so that her two long, slate-graybraids brushed against the earth. The posture seemed difficult for even a young person to main- tain. It seemed unnatural, especially because she did not move, noteven to pad the earth around a bloom or to pluck a dead leaf. Her gar-dener’s magic hands hung as limply as her braids. I wondered, wasshe lost in the manifold world of a flower? Was she concentrating onher pain? Maybe she was stuck, couldn’t stand up. I thought aboutcalling out, initiating an exchange: “Nice garden you have there!” Butthen I thought perhaps I would be intruding on a meditation. BeforeI knew it, my feet had carried me past her. At home I kept worryingabout her, until I went back out in the dark to assure myself that shewas gone. I never saw her again because as it happened I moved away soon after. But she is not gone out of my world, as are most others fromsuch touch-and-go encounters. I think about her and wonder, not somuch about her condition (that’s over now), but about my response,and my lack of response. She has come to stand for a host of peoplewho have drawn tangent to me, of whom I can only say, “I almostt o u c h e d ...I c o u l d h a v e t o u c h e d , ”o fw h o m I s o m e t imes think, I should have. ...I w o n d e r h o w i t i s that I have become so beset with 114"

From where hasthis reluctance to interact arisen? To interact means to have a relation with another, a mutuality. T o interfere, on the other hand, is one-sided; the French root, entreferir, means to strike. When I interfere, I am overstepping borders, invad- ing the space of other people. Lawmakers from Moses on down havetried to prevent such transgressions, but laws are at their best whenthey address the obvious: my dog on your lawn. In the vast terrain ofpublic space—the streets, hallways, subways, parks that are owned byus all and that must be shared—the sway of public law is weakest,covering only extreme cases of outright assault. Our relations asstrangers among strangers are instead governed by an unwritten law,the inversion of the Golden Rule: “Do not do to me what you wouldnot want done to you.” T o make a move, however friendly or casual,on another person’s space, to bring oneself to his or her attention forno good reason, is out of the norm and often considered intrusive.

      "text": "We are all strangers to each other, and if strangers have the nat- ural right to solace and shelter that Homer sung of, they also have, as Odysseus well knew, barriers of suspicion at every turn, which theymust take down, brick by brick, before they can enter the city.Throughout history the message passed from parent to child is con-tinued: Watch out for strangers. T o my father, it doesn’t matter that I am well into middle age. Suspecting that I, a former hitchhiker, havea residue of goodwill toward strangers, he takes me aside from timeto time and admonishes me:“Y ou have a family to watch out for now.Be suspicious of everybody.” I admit that I often am suspicious and assume that others are dis- trustful of me as well. In the first critical moments of contact, I la-bor—not so much with words but through a controlled positioningof hands, mouth, and body mass in relation to the accosted one—tosomehow establish harmlessness. It becomes a full-fledged science, tosuccessfully deliver a salutation. On a recent trip to Manhattan, the panhandlers whom I encoun- tered indeed threatened danger, but of a different sort from the kindmy father foresaw. When I reached into my pocket to placate one, an-other appeared at my elbow before the coins had even been dis-bursed, and when I turned to the second, a third would replace thefirst, and so on. It provoked a kind of horror of the sort that one feelsin the grip of an insect plague, or that pop heroes fear from their rab-id fans, or that Christ must have felt when he fled the multitude: theconsciousness of extreme vulnerability, the very real danger of en-gulfment. Like any sane person, I drew the line, made the occasional, almost furtive gift when struck by an especially poignant plea,learned the automatic “No, I’m sorry” when confronted with the rest.And I didn’t think too much. So it is for most of us.We pass from home to work, work to home, weekend to weekend, beginning to middle towards end. We advancein our careers, grow within our limits, ripen, and harden. Our spherescontain a few who are part of our identity. As for the rest of human-ity, we develop our stances toward them, positions we can act fromin our encounters without too much investment. Occasionally we actoutside our patterns, rising to a few emergencies (the stricken womanon the church steps, the two-year-old in the street), or indulging inthe collective giddiness of goodwill and empathy when the catastro-phe occurs (the hurricane, the Big Snow), and the glow from suchmoments lasts a good long while. As for the homeless, the needy, theconfused who will be with us always, the most we usually allow our-selves are twinges of sadness (not remorse, for we are not to blame).But they are not admitted to our memory.116 Rick Kempa"

      "text": "Suppose it were possible to ease our stance, redraw the lines, or at least make them dotted, permeable? T o be able to project oneself, and yet to maintain one’s selfhood? Instead of a human being, insular, tobe one of the human family, both free and committed? One’s career, the path of one’s life, could remain basically the same, but the quali-ty of that life would improve, the luminosity of it heighten. We wereall born without borders, “apparelled in celestial light,” asWordsworth said. From day one, imperceptibly, that light began todim, the lines of self to be drawn. This process took a long time; wecan recall the all-inclusiveness of childhood and our desperate effortsin adolescence to prolong it. Somehow, somewhere, the urgency sub-sided. We became “too busy” or “too involved elsewhere” to contin-ue cultivating openness. What we call “maturity,” coming into one’sself, was as much a turning away from as it was a turning toward. But the hunger for compassionate interaction persists, in dormancy atleast, in all of us, and only the most miserable skeptic would deny it. My friend and fellow commuter Doc is more given to this kind of interaction than anyone I know. An avid storyteller, as most ex-truckdrivers are, he never fails to enliven our thirty-mile-day togeth-er, and many of his tales are of encounters where he has played ahelper’s role. They aren’t all past-tense stories. Once every few weeks,he begins our drive with something like, “Wait until you hear whathappened last night,” and it would have to do with somebody’s boattrailer blown into a ditch, or a busted fuel pump, or lost keys, or astranded hitchhiker. I know him well enough to tell that he’s notboasting, and I readily lend belief. In trying to understand how hecould get involved so often, I thought for awhile that perhaps therewas a certain magnetism about him, a unique energy that brought tohim a larger share of happenstances. This mystical notion was punctured one afternoon when, speed- ing in the fast lane of the interstate, I blew by a stranded motorist,slowed for an instant to look at him in the mirror, and then kept onwith the lame comment,“T oo bad I can’t stop.”At that moment, I feltin Doc’s sudden stillness and silence (he’d been talking) the real dif-ference between us: not one of physics or of fate, but of attention, of attendance upon events. No disapproval of my inaction came from him; rather, there emanated from his side of the car a visceral focus-ing of energies, a mobilization of his molecules around the urge tostop. And there was no doubt that, however long it took to pull overand back up, or however rigidly the evening had been mapped outfor him, or for me, if he had been driving he would have stopped, un- hesitatingly. And having stopped, he would’ve seen the man throughhis trouble, assumed partial responsibility; he would’ve been that117 Redrawing the Lines"

      "text": "person’s angel. (Haven’t we all, once at least, known an angel, or been an angel to another?) Doc, of course, would laugh to be called an angel, and if I praised him for his “attendance to duty” or for his “humanistic priorities,”he’d be puzzled. He just doesn’t think about it much, and that iswhat’s most notable about him: that he doesn’t “think twice,” doesn’tconjure reasons to not get involved; he acts on impulse, and his im-pulses are generous. One might think that his career, his plan for himself, suffers be- cause of it, and, yes, occasionally he will arrive late or not at all, as theunseen circumstances dictate. But in the long run none of his com-mitments go unanswered. Furthermore, he allows for contingenciesby giving himself a buffer: he likes to leave early, just in case. One might argue, “I, to be sure, am no such angel,” and “such a disposition is part of his natural makeup, a rarity that the rest of usdo not enjoy,” and perhaps to an extent for Doc this is true. But thedebate between inherited and acquired characteristics is age-old anddoomed to deadlock. Who is to say that one cannot cultivate this vig-ilance, this readiness to lend oneself to people in trouble? Who is tosay what we are or are not capable of relearning? There are people we know whose telephones never ring, people along the curbs with gas cans or backpacks, people with whom we’velived so long that we assume we know them, but they, too, can bestrangers. We must aspire to be like volunteer firefighters, they whomove among us with an underlying readiness, a willingness to be sur-prised, a quiet consciousness of duty. Those for whom “duty”is too imposing a word might coax them- selves toward greater interaction by considering instead the theory ofreturns, by believing the folk wisdom that “what you give is what youget,” and “what goes around comes around.” Breakdowns will occurin my life: of machines, relationships, maybe even of the mind, and Ishould make myself worthy now for the angel I will need later. But the greatest motivator of all can come from keeping sight of our end. Most people do not pause until late in life to consider whattheir life has added up to, and many among these can only point totheir careers, to the space, now empty, where they’ve been. If only wecould remember to take frequent measure of our lives, to inspect itfor its quality now, before it’s too late to do anything but groan. Wesay to each other, “Be careful,” meaning take care of yourself. But we might learn to interpret this to mean be full of care, and in vigilance and trust, free of second thoughts, grow this way.

Humans who intervene with good intentions often causeyoung animals to die by driving away parents hiding nearby. Throughseveral painful experiences, I had learned to be very cautious aboutcrossing the line between humans and wild animals. So after scan-ning futilely for adult jays, I reluctantly left. Three hours later, the lit-tle blue jay still cried miserably, his beak sagging on the ground. Ahawk or weasel would soon hear him. After another hour, I knew hehad been truly abandoned, probably bumped from an overcrowdednest so the others would live. It’s nature’s cold, practical way. Despiteknowing this, I carried the helpless nestling to our screened porch. Itwas either death or our world now. Exhausted from his trauma, thelittle fellow feebly pecked once at my hand, then lay quietly—await-ing his end, I supposed. 120Bird-form finial, ca. 500–1500 AD.

He nearly impaled him-self choking and gurgling it down, snapping the tweezers for more.Then he assumed his begging pose—beak gaped wide, squalling piti-fully, wings tremoring. Nestlings do this to attract food from theirparents. I fed him more worm. And more. In the next hour my wifeand I scrounged up wild black raspberries, peanut butter, peas, corn,slugs, insects, and favorite-of-favorites—mashed potatoes. Thereseemed to be nothing he didn’t like. He begged at the sight of tweez- ers, at the sound of our voices, and finally, like other advanced crea-tures, at the hum of the microwave. “He’s so ugly!” Carol said. “Why couldn’t we find a chickadee?” Booper—named for his cry—was gray, not blue, and huge chickenlegs propelled his tiny body . Y ellow, scaly skin showed under his scraggly feathers—which sprouted from inside white calcium tubes.With his beak, Booper slid these tubes off so each feather fanned open into brilliant white and blue. Some tu bes he only pulled halfway, leav- ing feathers resembling hourglasses. When excited, he bristled hisstubby head feathers into spikes, punk-like. He was a jay version ofan eleven-year-old growing in six directions at once. Within a day heperched on my extended finger to tour the screened porch. I wasamazed that he crossed so easily into our world. Soon he napped onmy chest when I read, tugging my whiskers to make himself drowsy.As we lounged together easily, it seemed that I had also crossed intohis world. In a few weeks his tail feathers sprouted, and he careened wildly about the porch on first flights. But he could only fly up, so he’d crossfrom floor to window (crash!) to storage shelf (crash!), then squallfor help down so he could fly again. Meanwhile, feeding him had be-come a relentless hunt for grubs and worms. When I heard blue jaysoutside chattering, I wondered if the parent jays snickered at my toil.When neighbors watched, I pretended I was gathering specimens byacting vaguely scientific. A professor who has often behaved strange-ly can get away with that. We taught Booper to forage so he wouldn’t be hooked on hand feeding. In a pan of dirt we sprinkled live sow bugs—gray crustaceansfound under wet wood. He turned one eye to the pan, pecked a bug,tossed it into the air, opened his beak and caught it on the way down.Bravo! He gave a satisfied “whirrup”and repeated the same process—twenty times. I couldn’t believe what he put away—or the number oflogs I rolled to catch crawling things for him. I pounced triumphant-ly on squiggly, slimy creatures as if I’d found gold nuggets. So muchfor my own civilization.121 Empty Nest"

      "text": "After sating himself, Booper would store leftover bugs in any handy crevice—say a shirt pocket. But no hole interested Booper more than the one in my ear. He invariably opened his beak insideholes—perhaps to measure their warehousing capacity. Doing this inmy ear always enlivened me. He did “get” me once. When I pried outthe wet object, I was relieved it was only a bean and not half a worm.At other times he surprised me with his consideration—even cour-tesy. When he felt the urge while playing on our laps or shoulders, hewould hop to the edge where he could eject his gooey white sac with-out splattering us. He’d watch it hit the floor, give a satisfied“whirrup,” then resume play. The thought of tiny bathroom tissuecrossed my mind, but there’s only so much civilization a humanshould give a bird. Booper soon found an ideal perch—my head. He’d slip and scramble in my hair to nestle in. I tried to appreciate the intimacy, tosee it his way, but couldn’t put aside the fear he’d have an accident upthere. Had I lost the parenting touch? Was I too snobbish and set inhuman ways? Carol said I was doing “fine” (translation: “better youthan me”). The cats made their own suggestions about our new baby.They stared in disbelief through the window facing the porch as thetwittering thing fluffed out on my head. They twitched paws and gur-gled in their throats, “Grab-it, grab-it, grab-it!” The games Booper learned didn’t endear him to them either. No mindless romps after string. Booper climbed onto a two-foot modelboat and marched the deck with an oar in his beak, raising and low-ering his head spikes and chirping commands. Guests “oohed” asBooper dealt cards from a pack, and Carol trained him to find a peahidden under one of three thimbles that she moved around like a car-nival shell game. He rarely picked incorrectly, and in weak momentsI was tempted to see if I could make money off him at the local tav-ern. Surely he could pick the right thimble better than most of thedrinkers. Then again, being curious, he’d probably dip into unattend-ed beer glasses, and I’d face the shameful prospect of carrying homea drunken blue jay. In saner moments, I remembered that we were testing fate’s bor- ders between the wild and human. Was he to remain a caged animalthe rest of his life? Booper could only be a temporary guest in humansociety; he had a natural life cycle to fulfill and was becoming too civ-ilized. Now, when I sat in my favorite porch chair to read a book, in-stead of sleeping, he pecked at the rows of letters as if reading along,chattered incessantly like a commentary on the plot and tried to turnthe page before I finished. We read that human-reared fledglings go wild within a week of release. So, when we had trained him to forage and his flying im-122 M. Garrett Bauman"

Not until the next day did he take off on hisfirst beautiful flight into a hemlock tree. We cheered, and he preenedwings, stretched and spiked head feathers in self-glory. Freedom! Hetook more flights, returned a few times, then vanished. I brushedaway a tear and the droppings on the porch. Two days later he returned, begging for food, just like our Gen- X children. So we built a feeding station, and Booper came daily toeat and help around the house. He’d flap at our bedroom window atdawn to keep us from wasting the day. He did test bores in fresh ce-ment I poured for steps. When I tiled the entryway, he pecked mytools, pushed a pencil around, and hoisted snips of tile like a unionman. He brought new-found jay friends to his feeding station wherethey gulped peanut butter deliriously and thought him marvelouslywise. For a month he hovered in some neutral zone between bird andhuman worlds. One day as Carol and I walked to a neighbor’s yard sale, Booper circled ten feet over our heads, squawking. We ignored people’s staresat the crazy bird until he landed on my shoulder. “Heh, heh,” I said.“Look, Carol. A blue jay.” Then he dropped down to a table and strut-ted, pecking at doodads like any casual browser. “Shoo!” a lady suggested. Booper sassed her with a raucous call while bobbing up and down. As we reddened, he cocked his eye onthe shiny coins in the money box. I grabbed him before his fragilemorals could be tested. Eventually, of course, we helped Bo oper return completely to the wild. He had only been lent to us. Humans ache to cross over, to touchthe strange, wonderful creatures that share the world with us, butmost of the time these can be only temporary crossings; all creaturesmust ultimately live in their own skins and largely by their own ge-netic rules. Y et I know Booper was changed by his upbringing.Somewhere out there a flock of jays puzzle over his weird, human-ized antics, and I wonder if Booper thinks they are slow-witted.

The smell of au- tumn calls me home, not to a tangible house, street, face, but to anintangible home—a home so distant, so forgotten, so faint I can bare-ly discern it. Autumn is the memory of raking leaves as a child into a big pile at the bottom of a hill. My brother and I gather the leaves in the yardand carefully stack the pile higher and higher, halfway up the hill.Then, running full speed, I leap off the top and land safely into thedry embrace. Lying there and breathing deeply, my body molts intothe earth. Then I roll over and start again. New England autumns are potent. So many deciduous trees, and the colors like a Ferris wheel go ’round and ’round. Crimson, orange,lemon yellow, sienna, I am dizzy. The leaves start to fall, and I feel myown grip letting go as I toss and turn on my way to an opening I haveresisted. There is a consciousness in nature that says let go—let your leaves drop and receive my spirit. Taking part in this process, one must letgo, not only of habits and thoughts, but of who we think we are. Thebody I inhabit is narrow and full of pain; outside in nature pain doesnot seem to exist. It is painless to drop needles and leaves—there isno holding on, no grasping to endure. Some primal urge rises as I stand over the bed of needles. I want to cover myself with the golden quilt and drift away. I can hear thepine needles ping as they hit the leaves. Am I this body or am I thisconsciousness of nature—all-encompassing, still, and vibrant—stretching to catch the falling needles? There is a gush of creative energy flowing like a river through the white pine’s veins, whispering through the swaying tops. Nature is afree-flowing channel for spiritual energy. Letting go and embracingat the same time—this is the creative process, flowing from spirit tomanifestation through human hands. I let go, so I may embrace thefree flow of universal energy, like the pines shedding their needles somore may grow. I can’t be creative or in tune with God without let-ting go, without a sacrifice of sorts—a sacrifice of personal self, toembrace the universal self. Nature serves us. She freely gives her gifts to those who drop their pretensions, even to those who don’t, but those who do experience acommunion of creative energy. Salvation by nature pulls us out ofourselves and opens a channel for creative energy to descend throughthe body, and then out into the world. We are the instruments of cre-ation; we are part of the process.

I am in a galaxy of infinite possibilities—not of time, space, or form—with nowhere to go and nothing to do, and certainly no oneto be. I have fallen into a world of bliss and joy, without fear. I havefound myself, and it’s unlike anything else I have ever found, or willever find—this selfless self of spirit. The door creaks shut, and I am back on the other side. One care- less lapse of attention, one needless movement, and the expanseevaporates as if it never was. It is hard to abide in the sacred, hard toremain still. The restless body and mind, like a child tugging at yoursleeve, demand your attention. When I am in that other dimension, no one knows where I am; it is my secret. No one needs to know.

      "text": "132 Brother JohnAt the beginning of each season, the Benedictine brothers of Weston Priory, of which community I have been a member since 1957, step back for a few weeks from the monastic schedule of pub-lic prayer and work. These retreats are a prized time for us—oppor-tunities to take stock and to look forward to the season that is break-ing in. During this time, brothers take the pulse of their commonlife—the balance of prayer and work, the quality of fraternal ex-change, the spirit of hospitality. Our seasonal retreats also offer op-portunities to explore realms and worlds beyond the monastic clois-ter. Thus, our retreats are really a time to advance! In the first days of a recent spring retreat, we and our Brazilian guest, Leandro, set out for a visit with another monastic communityin Vermont, the Buddhist monks and nuns of Maple ForestMonastery in nearby Hartland. Our vehicles, packed with eagerbrothers, drove through the lovely spring woodland making theirway to a remote hilltop overlooking the Connecticut River valley. Our arrival in sight of the monastery seems like yesterday. Brown-robed monks and nuns look up from their tasks along theroadside or in front of the buildings. Smiles light up on Vietnamesefaces as palms join in front of the chest in a bow of respectful greet-ing. A tall, smiling monk directs us to park in an open space a shortdistance away. Casually dressed, we tumble exuberantly out of thevans to greet our host. The Buddhist brother offers a warm welcome,introducing himself by his Vietnamese name that he translates asbrother Emptiness. Sister Annabel joins the scene of welcome. Born in England, and a longtime associate of the venerable Buddhist teacher Thich NhatHahn, she is presently the Abbess of Maple Forest Monastery.Joyfully, brother Emptiness and sister Annabel escort us to themonastery meditation hall. At first glance the differences between the Buddhist and our own Benedictine communities are striking. The Maple Forest monks andnuns, mostly with shaved heads, are clothed in ankle-length brownrobes. Their formal dress and careful measured pace contrast with thecasual clothing and informality of their visitors. Y et, an air of warmfriendship links the two communities. The smiles and cordial wel-come in the eyes of the Buddhist brothers and sisters meet our en-thusiastic greeting as we awkwardly bow in turn. A smiling cherubic Vietnamese monk attends at the door of the meditation hall in silent welcome. All remove their shoes. Inside, thespace is open and peaceful. Natural light floods the open room car-peted with a soft, earth-tone, wall-to-wall floor covering.

Sister Annabel formally welcomes us in the name of their Buddhist community. Her first words are,“Brothers, very dear broth-ers . . .” A longstanding and intimate relationship between two verydifferent communities is immediately confirmed. At her invitation,all in the circle disclose their names and place of origin, revealing averitable League of Nations—Vietnam, France, Portugal, England,Australia, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, and the United States! The Abbess then sounds three resonant strokes on a large copper bell before her. The tea ceremony that she describes as “the nearestthing in Buddhist practice to Christian Eucharist” begins. In silencethe cups of tea are passed from hand to hand.A small cookie wrappedin a simple paper napkin accompanies the cup. All drink and eat to-gether. Communion is celebrated. Nothing on this day is done in haste. After the cups have been stored away, brother Richard, in the name of our Weston communi-ty, presents a handsome woven basket with home-baked raisin breadand small jugs of maple syrup fresh from spring sugaring at thePriory. The gift finds an honored place on the altar before theBuddha. There is a suggestion from the Maple Forest community thatthe Weston brothers might introduce the Buddhists to the Vermontcraft of making maple syrup. At sister Annabel’s request the Weston monks provide a reading from the Rule of Benedict for the common reflection of the gather-ing. The brothers distribute copies of the text of Chapter 72 of theRule (The Good Zeal of Monks) to everyone: Just as there is a wicked zeal of bitterness which separates from God and leads to hell, so there is a good zeal which separatesfrom evil and leads to God and everlasting life. This, then, is thegood zeal which monks must foster with fervent love: Theyshould each try to be the first to show respect to the other(Rom. 12:10), supporting with the greatest patience one anoth-er’s weaknesses of body or behavior, and earnestly competing in obedience to one another. No one is to pursue what he judges better for himself, but instead, what he judges better for some-one else. T o their fellow monks they show the pure love ofbrothers, to God, loving fear; to their abbot, unfeigned andhumble love. Let them prefer nothing whatever to Christ, andmay he bring us all together to everlasting life. A lively conversation ensues.

For him, the chapter on “The Good Zeal of theMonk” summarizes Benedict’s Rule, and in it the monk finds the keyto interpreting the whole document. The dialogue evolves from there. The word zeal indicates the en- ergy and enthusiasm expected of the monk and the community inface of the Rule. The monk is not to be a passive recipient. The monkor nun is to engage the Rule—questioning, interpreting, embracing. Benedict recognizes two kinds of zeal. The wicked zeal of bitter- ness is an energy that isolates the monk from his brothers. It puts onebefore or above others and pits one against the other. It causes sepa-ration and division within the community and leads to a kind of de-struction that may be experienced as hell. On the other hand, there is a zeal and energy that unites and brings persons together—a spirit that seeks the common good andplaces the welfare of others first. This force is the heartbeat of themonastic community and generates understanding, acceptance, andlove. Even as good zeal binds the community in unity, it motivatesthe community to extend the spirit of oneness beyond the local com-munity to others. The search for unity and oneness identifies themonk—a name derived from the Greek word for one, monos. Immediately, two communities from different cultures and spir- itual traditions, from two worlds, are absorbed in a dialog that tran-scends the space between them. This is no formal academic ecu-menism but a searching of hearts—a unique opportunity to explorethe world of the other, to discover new insights, and to strengthencommon purpose on the ways that lead to peace. A young nun, possibly the one who introduced herself as sister Patience, asks what the Benedictine brothers understand by the expression “competing in obedience to one another.” The question ofcompetition and its place in community stimulates observationsfrom both sides. Both communities know the destructive force thatrivalry plays in personal and communal life as well as in contempo-rary society. The practice of “putting others first” as an antidote tothe spirit of contention resonates with Benedictines and Buddhistsalike. Another question arises from the Buddhist community.“How do you understand the loving fear of God?” That Benedict proposes fearin a positive light evokes surprise for a Vietnamese nun. The mean-ing of loving fear is not readily understood. The fear of hurting or of- fending someone who is loved rather than the fear of punishment ortyranny seems unfamiliar. Attention focuses on the relationship offear to inner peace.

The issue of obedience in the passage under discussion arouses yet another conversation. Obedience has no easy history in commu-nity life. Mindless, legalistic conformity is known to hinder personalgrowth and keep one a child. For the maturing adult, to be childlikedoes not mean to be childish! Slavish compliance creates a fictitious,fragile, and superficial unity. In the Prologue of the Rule, Benedict associates obedience with listening: “Listen with the ear of your heart.” The Latin word for obe-dience stems from the Latin to listen (ob-audire). Listening deeply is a practice that enables the monk or nun to respond maturely, respect-fully, and with freedom. The practice of listening with the ear of theheart promotes a strong and genuine unity that endures. The art oflistening creates a rainbow that bridges the spaces of misunderstand-ing that separates two communities of different languages, cultures,and spiritual practice. An hour of conversation passes swiftly, leaving just time for a “meditation walk” before lunch. Moving on from moments of verbalexchange, the brothers and sisters engage in a Buddhist practice oftreading the common ground of serenity, compassion, and peace. Atthe sound of a deep-throated gong, the two communities and house-guests assemble on the patio outside the dining hall. In the center of the circle, sister Annabel demonstrates the med- itation walk. She moves slowly, her feet lightly touching the ground.In a soft voice, she addresses the earth as a loving friend that wel-comes and sustains humans and all creatures alike. Deep breathingand attentive steps suggest a new way to encounter the world—withmindfulness. It is not a sightseeing tour of the monastery grounds! One of the sisters leads the silent procession slowly down the road. She pauses at the end of a waving hay field. Eyes feast on themajestic White Mountains of New Hampshire on the distant hori-zon. The stroll continues past the simple dwelling of the brothers. Animmense horse barn, renovated to accommodate large assemblies ofretreatants, borders the path on the right. The way wends through ap-ple trees and slips by raised garden beds just sprouting from springplanting. All the while the shared silence invites the participants intoa deep awareness of oneness in the midst of diversity and beauty. The walk ends in front of the dining hall. With loving hands, Buddhist brothers and sisters have prepared the feast, tastefully set-ting out an array of Vietnamese dishes on the kitchen table—buffetstyle.

The host re-ceives the guest as a gift. Hospitality creates a different kind of world:a world of giving and receiving. In that dynamic—so different fromthe commercial or political worlds of buying and selling, taking andconsuming, speaking but not listening—distances are bridged, sepa-rations are overcome, a new world is born. The gifting, reverentialmindfulness of the Buddhist greeting receives the response of openarms and inviting words of Benedict to “Listen with the ear of yourheart.” The two religious traditions each teach that true discovery leads to realization. And realization only happens with change, with trans-formation. The brothers understand that the hard work of the jour-ney has only begun with the joyful encounter at Maple Forestmonastery. The injunction of brother Leo rings out to worlds beyondthe Green Mountains, “Stay open to the Holy Spirit.” Weston Priory, a monastic community founded in 1953, is located in Vermont. Creating a safe and welcoming place for others and integratingjoyful music in service and prayer are part of the central experience of theWeston community. Composition, production, and distribution of thePriory’s recorded music has become part of the lives of people throughoutthe United States, Canada, Australia, England, Ireland, South Africa, andmany other countries.

On a smaller and more per-sonal scale, we find various mutually exclusive editions of “the elect”claiming that only they are the saved, the chosen, and in many casesostracizing any who fall by their own little waysides. T o judge fromthe former Soviet empire or the regime of Pol Pot in Cambodia,though, there is an equally dark side to atheism, suggesting that thetwo “sides” might have more in common than either would like toadmit. Eric Hoffer said it with characteristic clarity: Though they seem at opposite poles, fanatics of all kinds are actually crowded together at one end. It is the fanatic and themoderate who are poles apart and never meet. The fanatics ofvarious hues eye each other with suspicion and are ready to flyat each other’s throats. But they are neighbors and almost ofone family. They hate each other with the hatred of brothers.They are as far apart and as close together as Saul and Paul.... The opposite of the religious fanatic is not the fanatical atheist, but the gentle cynic who cares not whether there is aGod or not. The atheist is a religious person. He believes inatheism as though it were a new religion. 1 Like any clear-headed observer of the human scene, Swedenborg was well aware of this kind of absolutism and of its perils. He wrote: No one should be instantly persuaded about the truth—that is,the truth should not be instantly so confirmed that there is nodoubt left. The reason is that truth inculcated in this way is sec-ond-hand truth. It has no stretch and no give. In the other life,this kind of truth is portrayed as hard, impervious to the good 139Alan Magee.

( Secrets of Heaven, paragraph 7298.2) He immediately offers a remedy: This is why, as soon as something true is presented by open experience to good spirits in the other life, something oppositeis presented soon thereafter, which creates a doubt. So they areenabled to think and ponder whether it is true or not and togather reasons and thereby lead the truth into their minds rationally. This gives their spiritual sight an outreach in regardto this matter, even to its opposite. This suggests that the alternative to fanaticism is not necessarily cynicism, however gentle, but rather a faith secure enough to enter- tain and appreciate the opposite. “The fanatic,” Hoffer observes, “isperpetually incomplete and insecure . . . his sense of security is de- rived from his passionate attachment and not from the excellence ofhis cause.” 2T o introduce the image I will be developing, it is as though physicists were to decide that because light clearly consistedof particles, it could not also consist of waves. The mind could notreach out and embrace the opposite. Niels Bohr is credited with extending this principle by saying, “The opposite of a correct statement is a false statement. But the op-posite of a profound truth may well be another profound truth”; 3and when Werner Heisenberg observes that “the same organizing forcesthat have shaped nature in all her forms are also responsible for thestructure of our minds,” 4we are invited to look at paradox as describ- ing one essential way in which our minds interact with the world“outside” them. We are invited to entertain the thought that we un-derstand light the way we do because our minds have both particleand wave characteristics. The self-styled “biology watcher” LewisThomas points clearly in this direction. The human brain is the most public organ on the face of the earth, open to everything, sending out messages to everything.T o be sure, it is hidden away in bone and conducts internal af-fairs in secrecy, but virtually all the business is the direct resultof thinking that has occurred in other minds. We pass thoughtsaround, from mind to mind, so compulsively and with suchspeed that the brains of mankind often appear, functionally, tobe undergoing fusion. This is, when you think about it, reallyamazing. The whole dear notion of one’s Self—marvelous oldfree-willed, free-enterprising, autonomous, independent, iso-lated island of a Self—is a myth. 5 Perhaps, though, it is not so much a myth in any derogatory sense as a profound truth needing the direct opposition of the profound truth that Thomas so vividly presents.

And in paragraph 191 of his Divine Providence, Swedenborg states that “Our own prudence is nothing. It only seems to be some-thing, as it should.” Reach out. Embrace the opposite. In John Faulkner Potts’ massive The Swedenborg Concordance 6 there are some thirty pages of references to the word influx, and the Latin search program for the published theological works finds 2,221instances of the word influxus. We are portrayed as maintained in ex- istence by God’s life flowing into us and intersecting with the inflowof energies from the various levels of reality in which we are embed-ded. 7In paragraph 6200 of Secrets of Heaven, Swedenborg offers a picture of this “inflow” as a wave phenomenon. When I was thinking, I could see solid concepts of thought as though they were surrounded by a kind of wave; and I noticedthat this wave was nothing other than the kinds of thing associ-ated with the matter in my memory and that in this way spiritscould see the full thought. But nothing reaches our own sensa-tion except what is in the middle and seems to be solid. This “wave” view of the human mind seems very much akin to that of Lewis Thomas, and it invites me to view myself as centered in a particular and unique place in the total patterned flow of humanthought and feeling. No one else has read exactly what I have read,has had exactly the same experiences of exactly the same people. Inthis respect, my individuality is absolutely secure. At the same time,my experiences overlap with those of countless others, making it im-possible for me to claim any particular “turf” in this flow as exclu-sively mine. Wherever my mind may be, it is not alone. All the same, there is a need for boundaries. Without boundaries I am vulnerable to all kinds of violence and manipulation. Withoutrespect for the boundaries of others, I become tyrannical.Experientially, though, it seems as though my interpersonal bound-aries, necessary as they are, expand and contract. Sometimes I reachout, sometimes I withdraw. This flexibility has its value. I would sug-gest that the more insecure I am as to my center, the more driven Iam by a need to dig in and fortify my boundaries.

He cannot be . . . baffled by contradictions because he de- nies their existence.” 8 In sharpest contrast, the willing acceptance of paradox, the en- tertaining of the opposite, is irresistibly liberating. Paradox lives inprocess and allows no status quo. It will not allow the mind to rest. In our interpersonal relations, the paradoxical relationship be- tween boundaries and overlap, between our particle and our wavenatures, comes out as what Robert Kegan describes as our “precioussense of differentiation or separateness” on the one hand and our“equally precious sense of inclusion or connection” on the other. 9He goes on to say: But what is most striking about these two great human yearn- ings is that they seem to be in conflict, and it is, in fact, their relation—this tension—that is of more interest to me at themoment than either yearning by itself. I believe it is a lifelongtension. Our experience of this fundamental ambivalence maybe our experience of the unitary, restless, creative motion oflife itself. 10 I believe that this is exactly what Swedenborg said in explicitly theological terms. 1. The universe as a whole and in every detail was created out of divine love, by means of divine wisdom. 2. Divine love and wisdom radiate from the Lord as a single whole. 3. There is some image of this whole in everything that has been created. 4. It is the intent of divine providence that everything created, collectively and in every detail, should be this kind of“one,” and that if it is not, it should become one. 11 In this regard, we need to note that a primary function of love is to unite and a primary function of wisdom is to distinguish and to add the heading of a subsection of the second proposition: “A formmakes a unity more perfectly as its constituents are distinguishablydifferent, and yet united.” 12The propositions can then be read to say that in Deity inclusion and differentiation, wave and particle, are one,and that there is some image of this oneness in each of us. They sayalso that it is the intent of Deity that this oneness should be realized; and if we see this in the light of the fundamental Swedenborgian as-sertion that “God alone . . . is life itself, [and] we are life-receivers,” 13 we would seem to be saying that “Our experience of this fundamen-"

The object relations theory of w hich Kegan is a proponent visu- alizes this motion as proceeding along a spiral path, with individualsat times answering their need for inclusion, then venturing forth toreassert their individuality, then impelled by loneliness to seek inclu-sion again and so forth, but at each turn bringing to their individu-ality or their inclusion what they have gained from the previousphase. The result is increasingly detailed differentiation and increas-ingly intimate incorporation. The “secret meeting of the faithful” is a tragic parody of this ten- sion. The group differentiates itself very decisively from the culturethat surrounds it and at the same time demands that its individualmembers merge their individuality with that of the group. A healthy“embeddedness culture,”Kegan says, is “that most intimate of contextsout of which we repeatedly are recreated. I suggest that it serves at leastthree functions. It must hold on. It must let go. And it must stickaround so that it can be reintegrated.” 14This he sees as true whether we are talking about the mother and the infant, the school and the stu-dent, or the therapist and the client. I would see it as equally applica-ble to the church and would suspect that like many institutions, thechurch tends to resist the thought of “letting go” of its members. Each of these “embeddedness cultures” is itself a subculture of a larger embeddedness culture. Each is, in the marvelous phrase ofDavid Bohm, a “relatively autonomous subtotality,” 15and only the absolute totality could be conceived of as fully autonomous.“We passthoughts around, from mind to mind, so compulsively and with suchspeed that the brains of mankind often appear, functionally, to be un-dergoing fusion.” Each individual, then, is a kind of unique micro-cosm of the whole. Science assumes that all the laws of physics andchemistry that apply to the entire universe apply also to us, whichmeans that we are akin to all that is. “The human brain is . . . open toeverything.” We are indeed dwarfed by the observable universe, andyet our minds are spacious enough to observe it. How we observe it says a great deal about us. “A fanatic,” said Finley Peter Dunne’s Mr. Dooley, “is a man that does what he thinksth’ Lord wud do if He knew th’ facts in th’ case.”What I say about oth-ers says a great deal about me for the simple reason that the line be-tween self and other is only half of the paradoxical picture. The bright side of theology, for me, involves this vision of a form in which the individual members are “distinguishably different andyet united.”When we apply this vision to human community, we findourselves looking at Swedenborg’s heaven."

I have shown him this tiny door at the base of the ancient maple, just as it was shown to me,and his father’s father, almost half a century ago. “Knock,” I say,“maybe if we’re lucky he’ll come out.” I look at the wee door and no-tice a bright clump of shamrocks has mysteriously appeared this year. Tiny sweet Lochiel, all of two years, could be the elf. Small for his age, with shaggy sun-streaked hair, his father’s green eyes rimmedwith long, black lashes and a sly smile—all that’s missing is pointyears. He is at the age of wonderment, when all it takes to silence a boo-boo is a bowl of ice cream. “Happy, happy,” he sings as he dances, spoon in hand, wide grin on his face still wet with tears. I hope he will keep this wondermentwith him always. When I was his age, my parents banded together with some ad- venturous relatives to buy this ancient house. The trees were alreadyold, from the colonial period, like the house. Everything neededwork. But it was a magical kingdom for all us cousins, full of fireflies,fairies, and scents of the sea beyond. Growing up in such a place madeus aware of the elemental world underneath. T o this day, we all stillbelieve. Of course, coming from a long line of Celts, it doesn’t take much to convince us. Stories of the unusual abound in our clan, and wecherish these tales. We happily pass them along to little Lochiel andthe next generation, that they might someday pass on the magic, too. 147"

But there is no record of any of that. T o say he was the unconventional relation would be misleading—ourfamily is as full of eccentrics as a j ar of mixed nuts is full of peanuts. Colin would write lengthy rambling letters with no punctuation, hismicroscopic writing slanting up the margins and in circles when heran short of room. The letters were strange, to say the least. He wouldallude to secret alchemist formulas or tell of how his money camefalling from the sky. But he would also mention things about me hecouldn’t possibly have known. My three cousins went to visit Uncle Colin in California. He was their father’s brother, my Dad’s uncle. He took the boys on a tour ofthe Disney studio, where he was greeted with respect and everyoneseemed to know him. He told the boys he was a wizard. T o this day,they all speak reverently of Colin the Wizard. One of those boys, my cousin John (closest in age to me and my former playmate), now lives in his own house further down the wa-terfront. He enjoys organic gardening and has developed a reputa-tion for his huge vegetables.A mutual friend of ours was asking John’sboy Colin (named after the Wizard) why his Dad’s garden grew sowell when everyone else seemed to be having trouble that year.T eenage Colin replied that it was the fairies. Our friend laughed atthis. “No, really—it’s the fairies!” insisted Colin. “Dad asks them tohelp with the garden.” Our friend went away scratching his head. Ifyou ask John, he will gladly tell you it’s true. Just like at Findhorn, hesays, as though everyone knows about Findhorn. I knew. All of usknew. Findhorn, for those who don’t, is a spiritual community at thenorthern tip of Scotland where beautiful gardens grow. Huge vegeta-bles and fruits seem to defy natural law and the elements. Findhornfolks tell us fairies are in charge. Many years ago when I attended college in Vermont, I was intro- duced to the writings of Rudolph Steiner, founder of the Waldorfschools. Steiner, mystic and clairvoyant, introduced Anthroposophyalong with many principles such as biodynamic gardening using or-ganic principles. According to Steiner, gnomes played a major role inthe development of plant life. In the fifteenth century, would-be alchemist and scientist Paracelsus (one of the first to discover healing techniques based onavoiding infection) described gnomes as wearing conical hats tocatch the sun’s rays, which would then transform the gnomes tostone. These beings were then able to move through the earth as read-ily as humans walked upon it. He, too, felt that gnomes were amongthe most important of elemental beings.149 Things Seen and Unseen"

In fact, the gnomes, or huldufóólk, are so important to the Icelandic people that plans for roads in certain areas have actuallybeen abandoned for fear they might disturb these creatures. There is a world that exists juxtaposed with our world. It is full of gnomes, elves, fairies, trees that rain marbles, and lost socks, too, Isuppose; it gets harder to see as you get older, but it is still there, wait-ing to be rediscovered, not just by the wee Lochiels of the world, butfor the grownups as well. Although I can’t see these beings, it is comforting for me to know that this other world exists alongside our own. Sometimes, when I re-ally need them, I will call on those fairies for assistance. I supposethere is a great metaphor in that statement . . . as with faith and all things Godly and unseen. Sometimes you just have to believe.

I smile at the generously applied plural and hear within it an apology for old age. There is no need. Time must turn. And today’schildren, whose rooms get steadily smaller around them, may also ex-perience a time when a room appears to grow by a step or more eachweek. This is Samantha’s space, my big sister, yet the shelves are crammed with dog-eared pages of our shared childhood adventures.They are the soul of an old lady’s room, otherwise decorated to ageneric preference for pink and frills. The typewriter is the heart,which can still beat animato when the occasional rush of inspirationcommands her. The rest, an orthopedic mattress to ease the pain ofeighty five years, a quilted carpet to protect cartilage worn knees, anda trail of pipes preventing the bones from freezing on a morning suchas this, is just padding, as a publisher might say. On the bedside table,next to the lavender-scented tissues, sits a bible, closed but book-marked. Movement plays across the curtain-framed window. I approach and watch the sun rising into a dull, gray canvas. Falling snow, thesource of the children’s shrilled excitement, is adding to what has al-ready ghosted across the land. It is her voice I hear first, and for a moment I think one of the children has escaped into the garden. But the hearty giggling comesfrom within my own mind, and as I watch her lying face down in thesnow, it is my face that grows numb with cold, and I know I am nolonger looking, but have returned to the garden from decades ago. 151"

I had never felt the sensational shiver as the powderedicicles infiltrate the protective texture of mittens, scarves and hats. Ihad never known the delight of crashing to the ground, only for thesickening anticipation of pain to be replaced with the cushionedcomfort of tickling feathers. I had never known fun quite like this.And so I lay, face down in the snow, compelled to laugh like I had nev-er laughed before. Overwhelmed with excitement, I trudged along to the garden swing my father had erected that summer and wiggled it into motion.Back I glided, my legs curled correctly beneath the seat. Forward Iswooped, my Wellington boots valiantly kicking snow into the infi-nite sky. Sepia images flashed across the ground floor window, played on a loop and powered by the swing’s trajectory: the sun in the sky, theneighboring trees, and the garden swing surrounded in snow. The fi-nal image, to the corner of the window where reflections died in theshade, was of my parents, looking out into the garden; Daddy hold-ing onto Mummy’s shoulders, unable to prevent them shuddering tothe beat of her tears. There had been plenty of crying that night, and not all from Mummy. Samantha had not come home. They were worried, I couldunderstand that. They hadn’t been on as many adventures withSamantha as I had. I knew she would be safe. I wanted to cheer them with a wave, but doubted the snow would feel quite as welcoming should I fall from such a height. So I easedthe swing down before embarking on the grandest, elbow bendingwave I had ever given. They didn’t respond. Grampy did. He was leaning against the back door. His visits were always special, and it seemed like a thousand years since I’d seen himlast, although it was probably little more than a few months in calen-dar time. Excited to the point of bursting, I redirected my enthusi-asm into the leap that landed me straight into his open arms. “Y ou’re getting huge,” he said, planting a big whiskered kiss upon my cheek. “Spin me round,” I replied, oblivious to the concept of aging.Grampy, as always, obliged.“When should I stop?”“Not until I feel sick,” was my reckless reply.“What if I’m sick before you?”“No,” I yell, the world whizzing past me in a circle of ecstasy.“I’m getting dizzy. I’m getting dizzy. I have to stop,” Grampy yelled back, increasing the drama with long, drawn-out vowels.152 Andrew Morris"

But knowing what I do now of bi-generational relationships,my grandfather’s arms were as secure as the most sophisticated seat-belt technology. Our laughter continued; mine long after the tearswere streaming down my cheeks. “We’re all dirty,” I screamed, vaguely aware of my mother’s po- tential admonishment. “It’ll come out in the wash,”Grampy reasoned.“Besides, you look pretty darn clean to me.” His search for dirt consisted of a full-blown tickling spree, which did little to diminish my uncontainable amusement. Suddenly, Ifeared for my self-control and the safety of my underclothes. Havinga sense for this kind of thing, Grampy eased off. “I didn’t know you were coming today,” I said, once again com- posed. “Surprise visits are always the best,” he assured me, and I had to agree. After all, hadn’t I just experienced the most fun ever? “Is Grandma with you?” I asked, already motioning toward the house. Assuming I was gearing up for a similar assault on my grand- mother, Grampy caught me by the arm. “Wait a minute,” he said, hauling me back into his lap. “It’s been so long since I’ve seen you, why don’t we talk for a little while?” I didn’t like talking. It seemed to me like a grown-up occupation. I didn’t understand the fascination with it; so many words with suchlittle sense. My parents had been talking all night and all morning,and had gained nothing more than red eyes and roar throats. Whywould I want that? Where was the fun? Samantha was lucky. Being eleven, she was allowed to play out- side the garden perimeter, which meant she could wander away fromthe inconvenience of adult conversation. Lately, providing she wasn’tgoing too far, I had been allowed to tag along. Being six, I had no con-cept of too far, and therefore not allowed to wander unsupervised be-yond our enclosed back garden. Samantha was different. She was sen-sible and intelligent. At least, that’s what Mummy and Daddy hadboth told the police, and I had to agree. “How are you?” Grampy asked, which sounded kind of strange. I don’t think anybody had ever asked me that question. Not openly,in a formal kind of way like this. I wasn’t sure how to respond. “I’m okay, thank you,” I said. I had heard adults converse in sim- ilar ways, but it didn’t quite sound right coming from my lips.153 Beyond the Perimeter Fence"

Recognizing my frown for what it was, Grampy’s smile broad- ened. “Can we go in and see Grandma now?” I asked.“No,” he said, his eyes lighting with a sparkle of mischief.“We are going for a walk.” It wasn’t bad, but I needed something more in the way of persua- sion. “And on that walk we are going to find your sister,” he continued.That didn’t sound too difficult. Samantha was undoubtedly on yet another perilous mission to save the planet. She usually was. “And then perhaps we can go and have some hot chocolate,” he added. Now that was the type of walk I could get my taste buds into. Lifting me into his arms, he said: “Now, where could your sister be?” Every place was a new destination to Samantha. I remembered our visit to Fairy Land, and the battles we had with Tyrone theTyrannous Prince. Then there was the Village of the Trees, where wesaved the saplings from Simon Saw, the evil woodcutter. And whocould forget our latest outing, when we were forced into combatagainst the Ice Witch of Winter Wood. “She’s probably down in Winter Wood,” I suggested. “Only, I’m not so sure grown-ups are welcome. Samantha says they can look butthey don’t really see.” “That is why I need you to take me,”he said, carrying me through the perimeter gate to the front of the house. There were men gath-ered there. One of them was shouting. The others grunted occasion-ally.“All these fine men are going out to look for your sister,” Grampycontinued. “But they will not be able to find her without the magic.” My eyes widened. “What magic?” I asked.We were eye to eye.“Y ou’re the magic,” he said.“And without you I will not be able to see into your world.” I nodded, privately doubting his ability to survive the trials of our adventures. There were several ways to access Winter Wood, depending on which part you intended to explore. We entered via the Jackson’sderelict farm, where the railings had been rolled back during the on-slaught of the Venomous Vermin. “Where now?” Grampy asked.154 Andrew Morris"

There was something about walking amongst these rusted hulks of once well-toned machinery that always made me nervous. There was a voice totheir silence that seemed able to penetrate deep into my conscience.Maybe it was the way they’d been left, neglected and forgotten. Ormaybe it was their isolation and loneliness. Grampy took my hand aswe entered the shaft. Descending the ladders, I considered our victory over the Invisible Whirlies, and tried to recollect whether our triumph hadbeen complete. Would Grampy be able to survive a surprise attackfrom out of the blackness? I was relieved when the tunnel opened outinto the side of Devil’s Cliff, and we lowered ourselves onto the ropeladder, and into the heart of Winter Wood. “Up there,” I explained, “in the trees, is where Samantha ended the war on the Petrified Pixies.” It is true that parents rarely appreciate the boundaries that chil- dren have to break down in the name of progress. “Further along,” I continued, “on top of the waterfall, is where she was hailed as the saviour of the Figalvaloo.” I don’t think Grampy had ever heard of the peaceful race of semi- elves, the tallest standing little more than half an inch high.Nonetheless, we continued down, a descent that took us sliding intothe rumbling belly of the wood. Snow moved beneath our feet, occa-sionally sending us grasping for the exposed roots of haunted trees,anything to ensure our journey did not end prematurely. Down intoan endless spiral of loose rock and frozen mud we traveled, ever clos-er to where the final battle of Winter Wood had been fought, insidethe lair of the Ice Witch. Finally, we were there; a million miles away from the nearest search party. Above us, the sky was closed by the branches of a mil-lion arthritic hands. It was cold and it was silent. Even the stream hadconceded defeat, crusted as it was with the ice that had thawed uponSamantha’s victory over the Ice Witch. “The Ice Witch came back,” I whispered. But Grampy heard me and held my hand tighter. The trees were looking at me, sneering at my return. Something was wrong. It was then I realized that we hadn’t defeated the Ice Witchat all, and we were walking directly toward the answer: a mound ofcloth, dumped by some unscrupulous citizen, if we hadn’t knownbetter. But we did. Each step was a cognitive awakening. I remembered how Samantha had fired the Willow Wand directly into the path of the IceGuards. How they had melted almost immediately, and how we raced155 Beyond the Perimeter Fence"

We crossed the rocks, careful not to slip, until we arrived at the jacket,trousers and boots I could not fail to recognize. It had happened as the Ice Witch screamed. It was unlike any- thing we had ever experienced. We had protected our ears with ourhands, but somehow the high pitched shrill had still penetrated deepinto our brains. Grampy leaned forward and pulled at the hood of my sister’s jacket, releasing iced-up clumps of long blonde hair. I could just makeout the side of her face, Whippy ice-cream white but for the tint ofblue around her lips. Samantha had done her best. On top of the rocks she had risked everything by removing her hands from her ears. She yelped, puppy-like, as the sound of the Ice Witch’s screams stabbed at her head.Gallantly, she had lifted her wand just as the Ice Witch had lifted hers,and I had looked in time to see good confronting evil. Grampy stroked Samantha’s hair, prompting her to stir, her lips to quiver, and her visible eye to open. She looked into his smile. “Am I dead?” She asked, finally.“No,” I said from behind Grampy. I almost laughed such was my relief at seeing her move. “But you will be if you don’t go home soon,” Grampy added, smoothing icicle darts from her hair. “I don’t want to leave her,” Samantha croaked, her jaw joggling up and down. “I don’t want to leave her alone.” “She’s not alone,” Grampy explained, “if you leave her with me.”Samantha rolled over and locked her eyes into mine. I smiled, but her face remained frozen into a rigid grimace. The last thing I had ever seen was Samantha hitting the Ice Witch straight between the eyes. By the time our evil foe had exploded intoa kaleidoscopic combustion of flame, ice, and water, I had slippedfrom the rocks; the final victim of the battle of Winter Wood.

They picked her up on a lonely highway in the White Mountains of New Hampshire shortly after midnight on September 20, 1961, and the ex-perience changed her life. The Grays made Betty Hill the first andonly credible alien abductee. And her description of her captors be-came the iconic alien in our culture. Having never met The Grays myself, the next best thing in my life has to be meeting Betty Hill. My interview with her in 1974 was setup by Betty’s niece Kathleen Daugherty, who lived next door on OhioAvenue, two blocks from the University of Cincinnati campus. One bright blue autumn Saturday morning, Kathleen came in through the back door with her cup of coffee, for a cheery chat,which was not so unusual, as the back doors to this duplex were al-ways open to the patio in good weather, and we visited back and fortha lot. This particular Saturday morning, however, she made me an of-fer I couldn’t refuse, in her uncompromising Y ankee accent, “MyAhn-tie Eunice is coming to visit next week. Puh-haps, you’d like tointuh-view huh, maybe do an ah-tickle?” At the time, I was a budding journalist, working entry-level jobs that proto-journalists do to gather clips, as editor of a small biweek-ly newspaper, The Clifton-Vine Reporter. Kathleen and her husband were among a close-knit group of friends who bonded in Cincinnatiaround the university life and who kidded me ruthlessly about my lit-tle neighborhood newspaper. They referred to it as The Daily Planet, Clark Kent’s employer in the Superman comics. For my birthday theprevious April, they gave me a nameplate that read “Perry White.” Hewas the editor-in-chief of The Daily Planet, known for his “great Caesar’s Ghost” reactions to Clark, Lois Lane, and Jimmy Olsen’s ex-ploits.

A week later, I was in Kathleen’s apartment having breakfast with her, her husband T om, and her Auntie Eunice, the First Lady of TheGrays. I introduced myself and turned on my tape recorder, and forthe next hour, had a delightful breakfast conversation with EuniceBetty Hill, during which many eggs, cigarettes, and cups of coffeewere consumed. T o his credit, T om, a usually opinionated, outspokenoaf, stayed quiet. Kathleen occasionally prompted her Auntie Euniceregarding details. I hadn’t listened to the tape of this interview in more than thirty years. I searched my basement recently and discovered it in a box thathad survived six intercity moves, two of which were cross country,four more intracity moves, and three flooded basements. I held mybreath as I inserted the tape into the player, and lo!The sound was still clear as a bell. I heard Betty’s gravelly voice and a younger, naïveversion of my own, and the clank of silverware on breakfast plates,along with the occasional exhale of cigarette smoke. I quit smoking afew years after this interview but not soon enough to halt the rootsof asthma. Betty never quit and died of lung cancer, although shelived a full and rewarding thirty years more. Betty described her and her husband Barney’s drive home from a vacation in Québec on the night of September 19–20, 1961. Shortlyafter midnight, Betty said, “In the Lancaster area, we became awareof a craft in the sky. Barney saw it first as a big, bright star, movingtoward us. It had the appearance of spinning, making sharp right-angle turns.” Betty dug out Barney’s binoculars and followed the trajectory of the object. “It stopped in mid-air right over our car,” she said. “We slowed to a stop right in the middle of the highway. And when the craft de-scended toward our car, we sped off down the highway.” The craft, which Betty described as cigar-shaped, had a band of lights around its middle and V-shaped wings with red lights on the tips. “It flew off, but then swooped back down at our car,” she said. As the craft approached, Betty said, “Barney noticed a row of windows on the side. He saw humanoid figures in the windows.” At this point, Betty said, “We heard a series of loud beeping sounds.” Betty described the sounds as “like someone had dropped atuning fork.” She said that they could feel the buzzing sounds vibrat-ing their automobile.162 Tom Lombardo"

When they arrived home, they became confused because the drive had taken two hours longer than it should have. The next morn-ing, Betty said that they noticed some strange metallic circles on their1957 Chevy BelAire, and they were still confounded over their loss oftwo hours and other puzzling evidence: their watches sustained ir-reparable damage, Barney’s shoes were badly scuffed, his leatherbinocular strap was broken, Betty’s new dress was torn, they felt con-taminated, and Barney’s upper back was injured. Convinced that she had seen a UFO , Betty phoned Pease Air Force Base in neighboring Newington, New Hampshire, the day after theexperience to report what she had seen. She and Barney gave a gen-eral description of the craft that they observed, but Betty said thatBarney did not mention the figures that he observed through the rowof windows because he did not want to be seen as a crackpot. T en days later, Betty said, “I started having recurring dreams of a moon sitting on the ground.” And there the incident stayed for more than three years, until December 1964. “Barney developed ulcers, and he was unresponsiveto treatment,” Betty said. “So, his doctor sent him to a psychiatrist, aDr. Stevens, who referred us to Dr. Ben Simon.” Dr. Simon insisted they both visit for therapy, and for the next seven months, under regression hypnosis, both Betty and Barney, inseparate sessions, began to reveal explicit and intimate details of theirexperience on Route 3 during those lost two hours. “After the first beeping sound,” Betty said, “our car motor died, came to a stop, and we saw men on the highway. The men came intwo groups, one on each side of the car, and took each of us along apath through the woods.” At this point I asked what they looked like.“They were four-and-a-half or five-feet tall with gray skin,” Betty said. “They were dressed in dark one-piece outfits with no insigniasor zippers. They wore small caps. They had no hair or ears. They hadvery large eyes, slanted upwards, and a small nose. Only a slit for amouth. I could not determine their gender or ages.” Did they communicate with you?“Only one communicated with me,” Betty said. “He communi- cated in English. His lips moved, but when they communicated witheach other, it sounded like humming or tones. Barney described it asa swarm of bees.” “We were taken to their ship, like an orange-red moon. It was huge, sixty to sixty-five feet across,” Betty said. “Inside the ship, we163 First Lady of The Grays"

This created a hubbub among the others, a loud hum-ming noise, like an argument. The Leader then came and took thebook back and said, ‘They decided that you would forget, so there’sno need to have the book.’ And I said to him, ‘ They decided?’ and he responded, ‘They have just as much right to decide as I do.’” Betty said, “I asked, ‘Will you be back?’ And the Leader respond- ed that he didn’t know, but he told us to wait in our car and watchthem take off.

And she said something that ruined it all for me: “I’m going to make mymillion off this story.” She mentioned that James Earl Jones had tak-en an interest in her story, and that he wanted to play the role ofBarney, who was African-American. She clearly intended her comment to be off the record, but now that she is dead, the bond of reporter confidentiality no longer exists. The regression hypnosis revelations lent credibility to Betty and Barney Hill’s claims of alien abduction. Their story first appeared ina Boston newspaper, as a five-part series and then, The Saturday Evening Post, a widely circulated national magazine, published a sen- sational two-part series in the October 4 and 11, 1966, issues. A fewweeks later, John G. Fuller’s bestselling nonfiction account of theirexperiences hit the bookstores. Entitled Interrupted Journey, the book contained transcriptions from their hypnotic sessions. In 1975, amovie A UFO Incident staring Estelle Parsons as Betty Hill and James Earl Jones as Barney was released for TVto very good reviews. Betty Hill rode this publicity to the top of the UFO cosmos. She spoke all over the world to all sorts of groups, including debates with UFO debunkers, such as the famed Aviation and Space Technology Editor Phillip Klass and others. UFO buffs refer to her as the First Lady of UFO s. She officially “retired”from the UFO world on the thir- tieth anniversary of her experience, in September 1991, although shecontinued to give interviews from her Portsmouth home. Betty and Barney Hill were a media-darling couple for the times. Betty claimed to be a true descendent of the Mayflower Pilgrims.Barney was African-American, and they were both active in the NAACP , which made them a unique couple, ready-made for the Civil Rights era in the U.S. After Barney’s death, Betty continued her pros-elytizing as a loveable character, with her pronounced NewHampshire accent, gravelly voice, a seat-of-the-pants expertise aboutscience and psychiatry and outer space, dismissive of critics with a“you-know-they’re-hiding-the-truth” air to her comments. UFO de- bunkers have poked many holes in her story, but the other side—theBelievers—loved her and still do even after her death and cling to herstory. And rightly so, because if Betty Hill told the truth, then UFO abductions have a leg to stand on. However, if Betty Hill told a lie,then the entire upside-down pyramid of UFO abductions, which rests all of its weight upon her, topples over. After Betty Hill, there really isno one nearly as credible.

In UFO lore, they are called “The Grays.” There is some debate about whether Betty and Barney Hill saw a similar-lookingalien in an episode of the TVseries The Outer Limits, but my point is this: without Betty Hill’s popularity, charm, and persistence, TheGrays may have faded into the gray of distant memory. Instead, theimage has permeated the world’s culture. Obviously, other types ofaliens occur in movies and books. The nasty beasts in the Alien movie series come to mind, and many other more maleficent creatures.Before Betty Hill, we had Robby the Robot in the movie Forbidden Planet, Klaatu and Gort in the movie The Day the Earth Stood Still, and other outlandish 1950s images of aliens, but once Betty Hill de-scribed The Grays, they took root. They seem to live on and on. E.T.herself was modeled on The Grays, and you can find little alien dollsthat replicate Betty Hill’s Grays in children’s toy stores today.

I distinctly remember the joy of first reading Swedenborg’s opinion that “only people of little judgment could suppose that our earth is the sole inhabited planet” ( Life on Other Planets, paragraph 3).1These were my sentiments exactly, and I suddenly felt a friend reaching out to me across two centuries. Some years later, I entered the University of Virginia and became a philosophy major. I was intrigued by Plato’s description of a near-death experience in The Republic. I began collecting accounts of the spiritual experiences of people who survived close calls with death.By 1974, I had interviewed more than one hundred individuals whotold remarkably similar stories. They said that—when they almostdied—they got out of their bodies and passed into a realm of lightwhere they met loved ones who had previously died. They experi-enced a panoramic vision in which they saw their lives reviewed inexquisite detail. Then, when revived, they said they learned throughtheir other-world journeys that the purpose of life is to advance inthe capacity to love and to accumulate wisdom. In 1974, when I was writing my book Life After Life, one of my professors of medicine mentioned Swedenborg’s spiritual adven-tures. He said that Swedenborg’s accounts bore many points of re-semblance to the near-death experiences I had collected. Frankly, it was some time before I realized, to my astonishment, that this was the same scholar whose work on extraterrestrials I hadread as a child. So, although I am not a trained Swedenborgian the-ologian, I have been grappling with his ideas in these two, distinctcontexts for about fifty years. Astronomy, Biology, and Intelligent Life in the Universe immanuel kant is generally credited with launching sidereal astron- omy—the study of the realm of stars and galaxies—in 1755. By thenit was realized that the fixed stars are suns like our own that appearsmall only because they are at enormous distances from the earth.Kant formulated three main ideas pertaining to the interstellar reach-es. First, he stated that the Milky Way, which was an unfathomablemystery to the ancients, was an optical effect created by the diffuselight of myriad stars too far away to be seen as discrete points.Secondly, Kant hypothesized that these stars were arranged into a gi-gantic disk that we now know as the Milky Way galaxy. Thirdly, Kantconjectured that the nebulae, hazy patches of light seen in the heav-ens through the then-existing telescopes, were other incredibly dis-tant galaxies of stars, comparable to our own Milky Way."

Y et they were not fully agreed to by all astronomers until theearly decades of the twentieth century. There is some debate whether Swedenborg’s Basic Principles of Nature (Principia Rerum Naturalium), 1734, presages the disk theo- ry of the Milky Way and the hypothesis that the nebulae are othergalaxies. My own reading of the passages at issue inclines me to be-lieve that he was indeed struggling with emerging notions that Kantformalized in 1755. After all, there is a tendency in the history ofthought whereby revolutionary ideas are first set out in a preliminaryand tenuous form and then later formulated clearly and more rigor-ously. At any rate, it is plain that ideas analogous to Kant’s were per-colating in Swedenborg’s mind as early as 1734. Late in the twentieth century, enormous technological strides created a revolution in the design and construction of telescopes, in-cluding orbiting telescopes, such as the Hubble. Consequently, as ofmid-2005, astronomers have detected more than 150 exoplanets, thatis, planets orbiting other stars. The New York Times (April 5, 2005) science section ( D4) featured the first photograph ever taken of a planet in another solar system. An article accompanying the photo-graph said, “The new planet will take its place as another landmarkin an accelerating cavalcade of discoveries that have left astronomersfumbling for synonyms for ‘historic.’” As I write, the race is on to find the first earth-sized planets cir- cling other stars. When that occurs, it will also be possible, by spec-troscopy, to determine the chemical makeup of their atmospheres. Inshort, science has now fully confirmed what Swedenborg assertedtwo-and-half centuries ago. Planets circle most stars, perhaps nearlyall stars. Concurrently, developments in the science of biology have made it appear far more likely that life exists elsewhere in the universe.Formerly, scientists held that life could exist only under a very nar-row range of conditions. Within the past few decades, however, exot-ic organisms have been found flourishing everywhere from scaldinghot, salt springs to frigid Antarctic wastes. Life has been found in ex-tremely acidic waters, in radioactive pools around nuclear reactors,and in rocks retrieved from miles underground. It has shown up onthe ocean floor around high-pressure volcanic vents. It has provenhardier than anyone believed until a couple of decades ago. It sounds like science fiction, but it is science fact.

      "text": "172 Raymond Moodysolar planets are currently being discovered at the rate of about three per month. It is in the context of this remarkable and potentially explosive expansion of knowledge that Swedenborg’s writings on extraterres-trials take on a new complexion. I contend that what Swedenborgsaid in Life on Other Planets contributes to the current debate about extraterrestrials in at least three important ways. First, it suggests possibilities for investigation that today’s re- searchers have not yet considered. Second, it suggests novel ways ofapplying the knowledge that would be gained from the discovery ofsentient extraterrestrial beings. Third, it makes principled, theologi-cal responses possible should intelligent life be found in outer space. Swedenborg’s Insights concerning Sentient Extraterrestrials much has been made of the fact that Swedenborg mentions cer- tain worlds within our solar system: Mercury, Jupiter, Mars, Saturn,Venus, and the Moon. It is not useful, however, to identify them withthe heavenly bodies we know by those names. Critics typically pointout that Swedenborg’s descriptions do not coincide with current as-tronomical knowledge relating to those worlds. These critics con-tend, therefore, his visions were simply mistaken, and his book onother inhabited worlds can be dismissed out of hand. Undeniably, this sort of criticism is appealing to those whose thought processes are primarily concrete and geared to the concernsof mundane reality. The trouble is that it is beside the point when ad-dressing a work such as Life on Other Planets, for three main reasons. In the first place, Swedenborg himself talks throughout the book ofthe profound difficulties of putting experiences like his into ordinarylanguage. He also mentions that he could not decipher the commu-nications of some of the beings he encountered and that some ofwhat was passing between them was ineffable. Furthermore, he says,“The earths in the spiritual world are not distant in the same way asin the natural world” ( Life on Other Planets, §135). That is, the realms Swedenborg visited were not in the space–time continuum as weknow it, nor are the categories of earthly languages directly applica-ble to those realms. Literalistic criticism of Swedenborg’s claims about extraterrestri- als blind the critics to the fascinating theoretical sweep of the book.I find much that is valuable here, which this type of critique missesbecause of rash attempts at debunking."

      "text": "The Historical Context of Swedenborg’s Life on Other Planets in the eighteenth century ,lines of demarcation among astrono- my, philosophy, and religion were drawn less sharply than they are today. The great thinkers who were then formulating what evolvedinto modern cosmology were as much spiritual visionaries as theywere scientists. Integrating the physical world into the spiritual realmwas a central concern of their budding cosmological theories.Through these men’s works, the notion of extraterrestrial intelligencewas rapidly becoming conventional wisdom. Eminent scholars feltcertain that sentient creatures inhabited other planets in our solarsystem and planets in the solar systems of other stars. Swedenborg’s contemporaries supported their advocacy of ra- tional extraterrestrials by two main lines of reasoning. First they ar-gued by analogy. Since the other planets that circle the sun resembleEarth in so many other respects, they must also be like Earth in be-ing inhabited. Similarly, distant stars are like the sun, so they, like thesun, must be accompanied by their own inhabited planets. The second type of argument these men employed appealed to the nature of God. What purpose could God possibly have in creat-ing innumerable worlds, they asked, unless it were to populate themwith sentient beings such as ourselves? Otherwise, they implied, theinfinite power and love of God would be going to waste, which wouldbe an utterly incomprehensible state of affairs. Logicians and philosophers point out many perplexing difficul- ties with analogical reasoning. So it is to Swedenborg’s credit that hedid not base his statements about extraterrestrials on argumentsfrom analogy. Nor did he base them on a transcendent intuition con-cerning how God ought to behave. Of course, he acknowledged thatthe existence of intelligent life throughout the universe flowed fromthe infinite beneficence of God, but there is a major difference of em-phasis. He begins Life on Other Planets by saying “because I had a de- sire to know whether there are other earths, and what their nature is,and the quality of their inhabitants, therefore, it has been granted meby the Lord to speak and converse with spirits and angels who arefrom other earths” (§1). In other words, he knows that there are ex-traterrestrials because of a personal experience of interacting andcommunicating with them. He could interact and communicate withthem because he shared a spiritual bond with them, through God. Itis this that distinguishes Swedenborg from the other great thinkers ofhis era who also asserted that intelligent creatures inhabit otherworlds in outer space. Thomas Wright (1711–1786), Johann Lambert (1728–1777), Immanuel Kant (1724–1804), and William Herschel (1738–1822)173 Are We Alone in the Universe?"

      "text": "174 Raymond Moodywere preeminent authorities on astronomy in the eighteenth centu- ry. All these men affirmed that there were innumerable inhabitedworlds in space, although they held this belief for different and evendivergent reasons. Historically, Kant overshadows the others, whoseaccomplishments have faded into relative obscurity. Kant’s thoughtson extraterrestrial intelligence naturally invite comparison with whatSwedenborg has to say in Life on Other Planets. In The Critique of Pure Reason, 1781, Kant reaffirmed his “strong belief, on the correctness of which I would stake even many of the ad-vantages of life, that there are inhabitants in other worlds.” 2It was an opinion he had maintained throughout his career. In Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens, 1755, the foundational document of sidereal astronomy, Kant asserted that the other plan-ets of our solar system are inhabited. In that book, Kant theorized that planets form from rotating discs of gas and other material that surround newly formed stars. Theplanets closer to the star condense from a cruder grade of material,while those farther away from the sun are made of a more refined sortof matter that was, by implication, more perfect. In that scheme ofthings, the farther a planet is from its star, the higher the intellectuallevel of its inhabitants. As Kant put it,“The excellence of thinking na-tures . . . stands under a certain rule, according to which these becomemore excellent and perfect in proportion to the distance of their habi-tats from the sun.” 3 Accordingly, Kant’s Mercurians and Venusians have only a rudi- mentary intellectual faculty, one that is inferior to that of Earthlings.The inhabitants of our earth, he held, are on “exactly the middlerung” as far as rational intellect is concerned. He claimed that the in-habitants of the outer planets, such as Jupiter and Saturn, are far su-perior in intellect to the inhabitants of earth. They may even be soadvanced, he believed, that they are relatively immune to death. Kant kept extraterrestrials in mind when he propounded one of the most renowned tenets of his philosophy. He intended the cate-gorical imperative, the fundamental principle of his theory ofmorals, to apply to all rational beings throughout the universe. So,like Swedenborg, he contended that we exist in a spiritual relation-ship with sentient creatures on other worlds. Ideas similar to many of those found in Life on Other Planets were in the air during the eighteenth century. For instance, WilliamHerschel, the celebrated founder of observational stellar astronomy,was convinced that the moon was inhabited, and Kant fully con-curred. Herschel even asserted that the sun and stars were inhabitedand offered definite descriptions of the beings who lived there.Johann Lambert wrote a book claiming that comets were inhabited."
